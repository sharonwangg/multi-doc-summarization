  Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The province currently has 270 ventilators, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health.  An additional 16 have been ordered, Health Minister Cameron Friesen said Wednesday. Manitoba's population was roughly 1.38 million in the first quarter of 2020, according to Statistics Canada. That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive. The total does not include ventilators in operating rooms, which are a different type of machine not preferred for critical care or cardiac patients, said Lanette Siraugsa, chief nursing officer for Shared Health, on Saturday. Those machines could be used to treat COVID-19 patients in \"certain situations,\ " she said, but aren't the preferred method. Based on a CBC breakdown of reported ventilators and provincial populations across the country, Manitoba ranks roughly in the middle. Ontario, with a capacity of roughly 12.3 ventilators to 100,000 people, is near the bottom, while Quebec leads the country, with an anticipated capacity of roughly 35.1 ventilators per 100,000 people. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines. They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.   (CBC News) But countries around the world are facing shortages of the machines as the explosion of cases overwhelms health-care systems. In the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, doctors have been forced to decide which patients get priority access, and which do not. That's the scenario Canada is bracing for — and scrambling to prevent — by finding more machines. Prevention also includes flattening the curve through public health measures like social distancing, said Dr. Atul Kapur, an emergency physician in Ottawa and co-chair of the public affairs committee of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. \"Right now, we don't have anywhere close to the capacity or the number of ventilators for the demand that we're anticipating, by looking at what other countries [experience],\" Kapur said. When it comes to ventilators per capita, Ontario's near the bottom \"This is unprecedented. The estimates that we have had so far are just not holding up to the demand that COVID is causing,\" he continued. \"And even now, it's a bit difficult, because we don't know how bad it's going to get.\ " Manitoba preparing 'for the worst case': Top doctor Most Canadian hospitals operate near 100 per cent capacity \"at the best of times,\ " Kapur said. That means they don't have the \"buffer\" to handle a sudden surge in demand — and neither did many other countries. \"That's the problem,\ " Kapur said. \"We're fighting with every other country to increase our numbers.\" Canada's readiness is a \"mixed picture,\ " Kapur said. The country is orders of magnitude away from what it would need for its worst-case scenario. \"Even the best case scenario ... Right now, we don't have the capacity to deal with what that would be,\" Kapur said. \"But hopefully we have time, in a matter of weeks, to build that up.\" Health minister asks Manitoba businesses to provide products, supplies for hospitals during pandemic It's difficult to pinpoint an ideal number of ventilators for Manitoba because the path of the virus in this province could change based on multiple variables, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. \"There's a large variability in the modelling numbers that we have. And so we're looking to prepare not only for the expected case but we're looking to prepare for the worst case,\ " Roussin said at a daily news briefing Thursday. WATCH | Experts say Canada could come up against ventilator shortage in weeks Canada could face a shortage of ventilators within a few weeks if cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. 2:00 \"I don't have a specific number that I could tell you. But we are putting things in place to prepare for worst case scenarios, and so ventilators, critical care beds, those type of things, are part of that plan,\ " Roussin said. The province has called on private businesses to donate ventilators and other supplies. On Friday, Friesen said public health officials have also had talks with manufacturers to see if they could make more of the machines, or other needed equipment. There's also nuance behind the numbers, said Dr. Kelly MacDonald, the head of the section of infectious disease in the department of internal medicine for the University of Manitoba and the WRHA. Respiratory therapists are needed to run the machines. Unions have already raised concerns about staffing levels at Winnipeg hospitals. Respiratory care at HSC overburdened, understaffed even before COVID-19, unions say Health-care experts are also working to find alternatives. Kapur noted some doctors are working on ways to rig ventilators to help two or three patients at a time, instead of just one, for example. \"I think that providing good health care and survival has a lot more to do with a variety of other things, other than just the machines,\ " MacDonald said. Ability to 'change our destiny' in Manitoba: emerging virus expert One of the traits of a COVID-19 outbreak that makes it so hard on health-care systems is a pattern of sickening patients all at once, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. Across the world, health-care systems have seen a sudden influx of very sick patients all at once, rather than staggered, like with influenza, he said.   He hopes that Manitoba has had enough warning to take action and flatten the curve, so that impact won't be as overwhelming here. He praised Manitoba's actions so far on implementing physical distancing measures, and said Manitobans have done a good job of responding to the call so far. \"It's not necessarily just one variable where the virus hits and then you need all the ventilators,\ " Kindrachuk said. \"We still have the ability right now to kind of change our destiny a little bit with what's going to happen in Winnipeg.\ " It's critical for Manitobans to act responsibly now to mitigate some of the pressure that will be placed on the health-care system, MacDonald said. \"Ultimately, how this goes is going to be as much an issue of how we do as a society, as it will be an issue of how people do at hospitals.\ "
  The provincial government is refusing to discuss numbers of ventilators in northeastern Ontario hospitals, but assures the public that there will enough if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse. The Northeast Local Health Integration Network, the provincial agency overseeing the health system in the region, directed the question to the Ministry of Health. The ministry says it has a stockpile of 200 ventilators ready to be distributed across Ontario and has 300 more on order, but didn't answer CBC's question about how many of the breathing machines are in the northeast now. The region's largest hospital Health Sciences North in Sudbury, which isn't providing any staff for media interviews during the COVID-19 crisis, says it has 62 ventilators and isn't worried about a shortage thanks to that provincial stockpile. The Sault Area Hospital has started putting up tents to help handle extra patients who may come during a COVID-19 outbreak.   (Submitted by Sault Area Hospital ) Dr. Rishi Ghosh from the Sault Area Hospital says they have 12 ventilators, but four of them are on loan from the province to deal with patient surges and could be moved elsewhere. \"We're anxious about how many patients are going to need these and if we have enough to provide all the patients,\" says Ghosh, the medical director of critical care and cardiology. He says the Sault Ste. Marie hospital also has several machines that help people with chronic lung problems, plus ventilators used during surgeries that could help COVID patients \"in a pinch.\ " \"These things can change in a flash, so if we get an influx, it's very easy to use up 10 or 12 vents in a couple of days,\" says Ghosh. Sudbury's Health Sciences North issues plea for personal protective equipmentHealth Sciences North now screening all visitors to Sudbury hospital He says plans are being put in place to establish \"hot and cold\" zones in the hospital to isolate those infected with coronavirus. Sault Area Hospital is also setting up tents outside to deal with extra patients. Ghosh says the tough part will be if they have to decide who gets a machine to help them breathe and who doesn't. He says the reports from hospitals in areas hit hard with the virus have been \"horrifying.\ " \"We've been fortunate not to have a patient influx with COVID yet, but we think it's going to happen based on the rapid rise in numbers that we're seeing throughout Canada and the U.S.\" he says. \"We've never dealt with something like this before.\" While there are now three dozen COVID-19 cases in northeastern Ontario, very few have needed to be admitted to hospital.   (hxdbzxy/Shutterstock) Ghosh says there is not much in the way of treatment for a new virus like COVID, so it's best to keep patients out of hospital in the first place.   \"Really we're just trying to bide time for your body to overcome the virus and that's basically a salvage type intervention,\ " he says.   \"Certainly stopping the spread in the community is the best way to stay healthy and hopefully get through to the other side of this.\ " The provincial government is not answering CBC's questions about how many ventilators there are in northeastern Ontario. Health Sciences North in Sudbury says is has 62 and the Sault Area Hospital has 12.   (Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP via Getty Images) On top of doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists will be on the frontline of any COVID-19 outbreak in northern Ontario hospitals.   \"We're in the face of these patients. We do this all the time. We do it with TB patients, we did it with SARS, we did it with H1N1,\" says Sue Jones a respiratory therapist in Barrie and president of the Respiratory Therapy Society of Ontario.   \"That's what we do.\ " She says her members in the north are right now getting ready for a possible outbreak, figuring out what equipment they have, what they'll need and learning lessons from countries where COVID has spread rapidly putting ventilators in short supply.   \"If the numbers ramp up like we're seeing in Italy and Spain, then no , we won't have what we need,\" says Jones.   Mike Baker is the president and the CEO of the Temiskaming Hospital.   (Erik White/CBC ) Smaller hospitals in the northeast are counting their ventilators, but are more concerned with keeping their staff healthy during any possible outbreak.   \"Our hospital has four and I think that's a reasonable supply for a hospital of our size,\" says Mike Baker, president and CEO of the Temiskaming Hospital.    \"It's difficult to know, because we don't know where this is going to go.\" CBC InvestigatesSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 Ontario ICU bedsCBC ExplainsWhat is a ventilator and how does it work? The hospital in Mattawa has no ventilator machines. But president and CEO Pierre Noel says their job will be to take other patients in their 19 beds, so the North Bay hospital can handle more COVID-19 cases.   \"This is perhaps still the calm before the storm. Hopefully the storm will pass up by, but nobody is counting on that,\" he says.  
  Life-saving resources — like ventilators , ICU equipment and staff — vary from health region to health region. (Thaiview/Shutterstock) With the peak of the coronavirus pandemic expected later this year, life-saving resources in each of Newfoundland and Labrador's health regions vary.   In Labrador-Grenfell Health, where the province's first cases of COVID-19 appeared in early March, there is one four-bed intensive-care unit, at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony on the Northern Peninsula. There are no designated ICU beds in Labrador. Through a spokesperson, Labrador-Grenfell Health declined an interview, but in a statement the health authority said anyone requiring highly specialized tertiary care will be transported to Eastern Health. Intensive care is \"defined by the level of care required, skill set of staff and equipment, it is not a location,\" says the statement. The statement says the authority has 15 ventilators and is searching for 15 more. Wabush Mayor Ron Barron says he is worried about a surge in cases in the region. He has called for people entering Labrador West to isolate for 14 days. File photo. (Jacob Barker/CBC) With just four of those ventilators and two oxygen rooms in Labrador West, Wabush Mayor Ron Barron worries about a surge of cases. \"It's definitely a wakeup call as to what we do have available,\" said Barron. \"Is it enough? Right now it is, because we don't have any cases really. [But] if this took off in the region we wouldn't be nowhere near ready to look after people with what we have.\ " Barron is among a number of community leaders calling on the province to halt non-essential travel to Labrador, which has three cases of COVID-19, which the provincial government has rejected. Barron also wants people entering the region to isolate for 14 days.   \"This is how this stuff gets spread, it's travel. So let's limit every minute of travel that anybody has to take,\" said Barron. \"What's really disheartening is that the premier didn't listen to the people here in Labrador.\ " Meanwhile, 34 employees and physicians at Labrador-Grenfell Health are self-isolating, and one health-care worker has tested positive for coronavirus as of Wednesday. Western Health Western Health can isolate patients in dedicated coronavirus units at the Western Memorial Regional Hospital in Corner Brook and at the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital in Stephenville. There are 27 beds in Corner Brook's COVID-19 unit, with planning underway for a second 11-bed unit. In Stephenville, there are six beds. Western Memorial Regional Hospital's ICU has eight beds available with the capacity for three more, and 10 more in the operating room recovery area. In the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital there are two ICU beds, with room for one more. The Western region has 29 ventilators and is looking for 15 more.   All four of Labrador-Grenfell Health's ICU beds are at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony. (Google Streetview) Teara Freake, Western Health's vice-president of clinical-patient services, said the long-term care facility due to open this spring in Corner Brook can be used to fee up hospital beds. She said they plan to move patients who are in hospital waiting for long-term care beds to the new facility. \"So that would then create capacity within Western Memorial for the COVID patients or any additional acute-care patients who require a higher level of care,\ " said Freake. Freake says Western Health is prepared to face a surge in cases. \"We feel we have the competency of staff and the appropriate skill mix to be able to care for patients.\" Central Health In Central Health, the second-largest health authority in the province, there are 23 beds in a dedicated COVID-19 unit at the Central Newfoundland Regional Health Centre in Grand Falls-Windsor. The health region has 17 ventilators and 17 ICU beds. The College of the North Atlantic, and stadiums in Gander and Grand-Falls Windsor, would be used for surge capacity, with 100 cots available. As of Thursday, 36 employees and physicians were self-isolating, and none were positive for COVID-19. Eastern Health The bulk of the province's coronavirus cases — 227 cases — are in the Eastern Health region, the largest region in the province, where most of the province's life-saving resources are. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. The region also has a 30-bed COVID-19 unit and is planning a second unit with 11 beds. (CBC) The Health Authority has created a 30-bed COVID-19 unit at the Health Sciences Centre, with plans underway for a second one.    Last month, CEO David Diamond told CBC News that Memorial University's Field House will be used as a backup emergency clinic if needed. It has 10 beds available. Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador 
  Newfoundland and Labrador's COVID-19 caseload became heavier Sunday, as officials revealed that 15 more people have tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, made the announcement during a public briefing on Sunday afternoon.   The total number of cases in the province now sits at 135.  All new cases are in the Eastern Health region, Fitzgerald said. There have been 2,107 tests done for COVID-19. Seven people have now been hospitalized, with two people now in intensive care. \"This is something we do not want to see,\ " Premier Dwight Ball said during the briefing, adding that officials have nonetheless been bracing for the COVID-19 situation to become more serious.   Stay inside so the virus stands outside.- Premier Dwight Ball \"We do not want to be alarmist, but we have to be truthful with you. This is how serious COVID-19 is,\" he said.   \"Stay inside so the virus stands outside.\" Health Minister John Haggie said none of the province's ventilators are being used on a COVID-19 patient. Haggie also cautioned that residents of Newfoundland and Labrador need to prepare for what could be a long haul.   \"We are now in our third week,\ " Haggie said. \"What we do now will determine [how] our next three to six to nine to 12 weeks will pan out in terms of the health and well-being of the people of this province.\ "   He also pleaded with people to stay inside as much as possible, and to shop individually and not in groups, and even then only for essential goods. He criticized people who go to browse at stores that have been allowed to stay open as essential businesses through public health emergency legislation.   \"Stay in your bubble and don't burst anyone else's bubble,\ " Haggie said. \"We are well equipped in terms of ventilators, in terms of ICU beds.  We're better equipped than a lot of metropolitan cities, because we have had to be self-reliant,\" said Haggie, adding that more gear is on the way.   Troubling week for spread of disease The last week has been a hectic and often troubling one for Newfoundland and Labrador, where COVID-19 had arrived relatively late compared with most provinces.   Within the last week, one troubling milestone after another was recorded. Cases moved through the double digits and into the triple digits.   Saturday marked the first confirmations of cases spread by what's called community transmission. That's when someone has contracted the highly infectious coronavirus, and contact tracing cannot connect it to another confirmed case.   Haggie said Sunday that the prior day's revelation of community transmission caused a spike in calls to the province's 811 health line, through which public health nurses are assessing patients and, if needed, directing them for tests and other care. Haggie added that more than 200 people were waiting for a callback from the service, and advised people to pick up when the phone rings from an unknown number.    INTERACTIVE: Tracking the coronavirus across Canada   Newfoundland and Labrador has not yet recorded the most dreaded statistic: a death due to COVID-19.   Most of the spike in new cases this week has been attributed to one cluster: people who attended a funeral at Caul's Funeral Home on LeMarchant Road in St. John's, and thus people they contacted. On Sunday, Fitzgerald said 99 cases so far are connected to Caul's, which is considered the largest single coronavirus cluster in Canada so far. Refinery to close In a video posted to Facebook on Sunday evening, United Steelworkers Local 9316 president Glenn Nolan said the North Atlantic oil refinery at Come By Chance will shut down, starting Sunday.   Nolan said the shutdown process will take about five days and the refinery will remain in idle mode until it's financially viable to start up again. Mail service resuming Monday Meanwhile, in a statement issued on Sunday, Canada Post said it intends to resume operations at its mail distribution centre on Kenmount Road in St. John's on Monday, and is contacting employees tp provide more information. The facility closed Monday after Canada Post was informed an employee had tested positive for COVID-19. In this file image, Canada Post trucks are parked in the lot of the Kenmount Road postal facility in St. John's. (Andrew Sampson/CBC) Canada Post said public health officials have completed contact tracing, and any affected people will now remain in self-isolation. The company said the entire Kenmount Road facility has been sanitized, vehicles will be sanitized by Monday and physical distancing measures will be put in place throughout the facility. All K-9 students will pass this year: N.L. English school district The statement also said that while the delivery of mail and parcels will resume Monday, it will take some time to fully restart operations, and asks the public to be patient and practise appropriate physical distancing with staff. No update on high school students   The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said Sunday it has not yet made a decision about what will happen with students from Grade 9 to 12 in light of school closures due to COVID-19, but are close to a \"definite decision.\ "  \"Hopefully we will get something out this week,\" said Tony Stack, CEO of the district. \"A decision like this has to be carefully considered.\ " Stack said the focus is on graduating classes. He said the school district has been in conversations with post-secondary institutions in the province as well as the Department of Education to figure out the best way forward. Tony Stack, the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District's director of education, says he hopes to have an update on high school students this week. (Sherry Vivan/CBC) However, Stack said graduating students will not be at a disadvantage in their post-secondary education plans. \"We will arrive at a place where the students will be pleased and supported,\ " he said. Stack recommended the Centre for Distance Learning and Innovation online resource for high school students. Students can register online to use the resource for all the high school grades. Avoid get-togethers outdoors, snowmobilers warned Meanwhile, Haggie and others continue to step up their calls for people to stay home and go outside only when necessary. Haggie said people will need to maintain social distancing outdoors as well as inside — and that means an end to beloved outdoor activities.    Warmup shacks on the T'railway are not really the place to be this weekend.- Dr. John Haggie For instance, no hanging out in sheds or snowmobiling together.   \"It's a shame if you socially distance yourself at home only to undo that good work by running risks with a whole different group of the boys in the woods,\ " Haggie said.   \"Warmup shacks on the T'railway are not really the place to be this weekend.\" Speaking with reporters Saturday, Haggie added, \"The virus only moves when people move. If you do not move, the virus cannot move.\" Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador  
  Provincial health experts say they expect COVID-19 could kill 3,000 to 15,000 people in Ontario over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, the ramifications of which could last up to two years. Those revelations were part of modelling projections the province released Friday about the spread of COVID-19. Matthew Anderson, the head of Ontario Health, Adalsteinn Brown, dean of the University of Toronto's public health department, and Dr. Peter Donnelly, who heads Public Health Ontario, held a news conference to explain the models.  You can read the full report at the bottom of this story.   \"Had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\ " Donnelly said, referring to the potential beneficial impact of the province's physical distancing measures. \"Thankfully, that is not the position we are in.\ " WATCH |  Dr. Peter Donnelly explains the deadly risk COVID-19 poses Dr. Peter Donnelly, president and CEO of Public Health Ontario, says the number of fatalities in the province could be reduced to somewhere between 3,000 and 15,000 if strict preventative measures continue to be taken. 1:33 Donnelly said he understands these figures may seem \"scary, intimidating\" and to many, \"unlikely.\ " But, he said, every year in Ontario, about 1,350 people die from normal, seasonal flu. In a bad year, 1,500 people die. \"When you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and you remember we have no vaccine, and we have no specific treatment ... then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible.\ " Donnelly said Friday that people can change the outcome throughout the province by staying home and physically distancing. \"We need everyone to stay focused in the weeks ahead,\ " he said. Donnelly also said the time frame of 18 months to two years is in line with other credible models about the pandemic, which account for the possibility of secondary or tertiary waves. WATCH |  Donnelly explains how Ontario can slow the spread of COVID-19: Dr. Peter Donnelly, president and CEO of Public Health Ontario, describes how the spread of COVID-19 will eventually falter if residents maintain physical distancing measures. 1:37 He did not suggest current restrictions will be in place for that period of time, but later added \"we are some way off\" from lifting physical distancing policies, especially in densely populated areas like the GTA. Decisions to ease physical distancing measures will need to be driven by \"complicated modelling and science,\" he said, and done in a \"thoughtful\" way. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said Friday that officials will look to the data to tell them how soon distancing measures could be eased in the future.  INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 57,000+ cases in Canada on Sunday \"That's not right now , that's not in the next couple weeks or so,\" Williams said. \"The more everyone does what they're supposed to do now, the shorter the period will be,\" said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health for the province.   ' Nothing is worth more than a life,' Ford says Premier Doug Ford and Health Minister Christine Elliott implored Ontarians to do their part to help ease the burden on the province's hospitals, while Ford announced more shutdowns — including some construction projects. \"Everyone has had to pay a price in this war. Daily life has ground to a halt,\ " Ford said. Given the projections released today, that was the right thing to do, he said. \"Nothing is worth more than a life.\" Elliott asked people to remember the personal toll of these deaths. \"These are more than mere numbers,\ " she said. \"They are our friends and family and neighbours.\ " Seniors still the hardest hit, models show The province's projections note that in Ontario, COVID-19 has a high mortality rate for people over the age of 80, at just under 16 per cent. That's a little under levels seen globally, which are around 20 per cent, Donnelly said. The mortality rate for people over 70 years old is around 10 per cent, he said. Background, from left: Matthew Anderson, president and CEO of Ontario Health, Dr. Peter Donnelly, president and CEO of Public Health Ontario and Adalsteinn Brown of the University of Toronto explain their COVID-19 provincial modelling in Toronto. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) The province's data also comes with some caveats. Its presentation states that models are used to help plan for what \"could\" happen, and as with any model, the farther out predicted, the more uncertainty there is in those predictions. There is more confidence in the projections over the next 30 days than over the longer term projections, the province says, adding that \"assumptions were used to inform the model.\ " \"Projections and modelling of a brand new viral disease are very inexact,\ " Donnelly said. Most intensive care units full The province's modelling also examines the situation in intensive care units. According to the province, there are currently 410 available ICU beds in Ontario for COVID-19 patients, in addition to the beds that are currently filled with patients. Anderson said that put the province's capacity at 70 per cent. But, he said, the province is also planning to add 900 additional ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in the coming weeks.   With those additional beds in place, a \"best case\" scenario would keep the numbers in ICUs from maxing out the available beds, according to the province's projections. But in a \"worst case\" scenario, the numbers of people who would need beds could severely exceed what's available. That could happen if people don't practise physical distancing, Anderson said. \"It would push beyond the capacity we can bring,\" he said. Moving patients within the province That ICU capacity is across the province, which means healthcare providers will likely have to move patients and equipment within Ontario depending on need, Anderson said. According to data obtained by CBC News, the number of available intensive care beds in certain parts of the Greater Toronto Area is rapidly shrinking as the number of COVID-19 patients surges higher.   Just nine critical care beds remain available among the 153 ICU beds in the hospitals of the Central Local Health Integration Network, which includes Mackenzie Richmond Hill, Markham Stouffville, Southlake, Humber River, and North York General hospitals.   Premier to release 'really stark' projections Friday as Ontario confirms 401 new COVID-19 casesStill standing within 2 metres of each other? That could cost you $5K under new bylaw, Tory says Those hospitals are caring for 32 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 — double the number they were four days earlier.    The figures come from the April 2 COVID-19 daily report from Critical Care Services Ontario, which was obtained by CBC News but has not been made public by the provincial health ministry. The report does not show a hospital-by-hospital breakdown of ICU bed occupancy rates.   The reports also show just 18 ICU beds available among the 130 critical care beds among the hospitals in the Mississauga Halton Local Health Integration Network — including Trillium Health Partners and the Oakville Trafalgar,  Milton District and Georgetown hospitals.    The bulk of COVID-19 patients are cared for in what the province calls Level 3 critical care beds, the highest level of intensive care. More than 90 per cent of those beds are full In the Central East local health integration network, which includes the Etobicoke General and Brampton Civic hospitals of the William Osler Health System.     The reports also shows high demand for ventilators among those hospitals. There are 33 ICU patients on ventilators, but their total official capacity of ICU beds with ventilators is just 26.   The Ministry of Health has previously said it can provide extra ventilators to hospitals that need them from a centralized provincial stockpile. Models will change, professor says Robert Smith, a disease modelling professor at the University of Ottawa, described the model as a useful projection based on available data, though he said the numbers ought to be frequently updated as more research is conducted. \"The best models will be dynamic and they will change as more data comes,\ " he said. Ontario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half: study He also warned that Ontario should not become complacent and relax its measures around physical distancing too soon, since the best case scenario is unlikely \"unless everything goes just so.\ " While Ontario is releasing its models, the federal government still hasn't published its own projections for how hard COVID-19 could hit Canada. \"We've been releasing information every single day on the data received from the provinces. We need to make sure the projections we will be releasing will be based on the most accurate information out there,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.  Toronto could see up to 3,000 COVID-19 deaths, city facing $65M cost each week: officials \"We need to make sure we have a better grasp on the accuracy of the data before we put projections out there.\ " However, B.C.'s government released projections last week that included details about the pressure the virus could put on ICU beds.   You can read the full Ontario government model below: Mobile users: View the document (PDF KB) (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content On mobile and can't see the model?

  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  Life-saving resources — like ventilators , ICU equipment and staff — vary from health region to health region. (Thaiview/Shutterstock) With the peak of the coronavirus pandemic expected later this year, life-saving resources in each of Newfoundland and Labrador's health regions vary.   In Labrador-Grenfell Health, where the province's first cases of COVID-19 appeared in early March, there is one four-bed intensive-care unit, at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony on the Northern Peninsula. There are no designated ICU beds in Labrador. Through a spokesperson, Labrador-Grenfell Health declined an interview, but in a statement the health authority said anyone requiring highly specialized tertiary care will be transported to Eastern Health. Intensive care is \"defined by the level of care required, skill set of staff and equipment, it is not a location,\" says the statement. The statement says the authority has 15 ventilators and is searching for 15 more. Wabush Mayor Ron Barron says he is worried about a surge in cases in the region. He has called for people entering Labrador West to isolate for 14 days. File photo. (Jacob Barker/CBC) With just four of those ventilators and two oxygen rooms in Labrador West, Wabush Mayor Ron Barron worries about a surge of cases. \"It's definitely a wakeup call as to what we do have available,\" said Barron. \"Is it enough? Right now it is, because we don't have any cases really. [But] if this took off in the region we wouldn't be nowhere near ready to look after people with what we have.\ " Barron is among a number of community leaders calling on the province to halt non-essential travel to Labrador, which has three cases of COVID-19, which the provincial government has rejected. Barron also wants people entering the region to isolate for 14 days.   \"This is how this stuff gets spread, it's travel. So let's limit every minute of travel that anybody has to take,\" said Barron. \"What's really disheartening is that the premier didn't listen to the people here in Labrador.\ " Meanwhile, 34 employees and physicians at Labrador-Grenfell Health are self-isolating, and one health-care worker has tested positive for coronavirus as of Wednesday. Western Health Western Health can isolate patients in dedicated coronavirus units at the Western Memorial Regional Hospital in Corner Brook and at the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital in Stephenville. There are 27 beds in Corner Brook's COVID-19 unit, with planning underway for a second 11-bed unit. In Stephenville, there are six beds. Western Memorial Regional Hospital's ICU has eight beds available with the capacity for three more, and 10 more in the operating room recovery area. In the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital there are two ICU beds, with room for one more. The Western region has 29 ventilators and is looking for 15 more.   All four of Labrador-Grenfell Health's ICU beds are at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony. (Google Streetview) Teara Freake, Western Health's vice-president of clinical-patient services, said the long-term care facility due to open this spring in Corner Brook can be used to fee up hospital beds. She said they plan to move patients who are in hospital waiting for long-term care beds to the new facility. \"So that would then create capacity within Western Memorial for the COVID patients or any additional acute-care patients who require a higher level of care,\ " said Freake. Freake says Western Health is prepared to face a surge in cases. \"We feel we have the competency of staff and the appropriate skill mix to be able to care for patients.\" Central Health In Central Health, the second-largest health authority in the province, there are 23 beds in a dedicated COVID-19 unit at the Central Newfoundland Regional Health Centre in Grand Falls-Windsor. The health region has 17 ventilators and 17 ICU beds. The College of the North Atlantic, and stadiums in Gander and Grand-Falls Windsor, would be used for surge capacity, with 100 cots available. As of Thursday, 36 employees and physicians were self-isolating, and none were positive for COVID-19. Eastern Health The bulk of the province's coronavirus cases — 227 cases — are in the Eastern Health region, the largest region in the province, where most of the province's life-saving resources are. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. The region also has a 30-bed COVID-19 unit and is planning a second unit with 11 beds. (CBC) The Health Authority has created a 30-bed COVID-19 unit at the Health Sciences Centre, with plans underway for a second one.    Last month, CEO David Diamond told CBC News that Memorial University's Field House will be used as a backup emergency clinic if needed. It has 10 beds available. Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador 
  The supplies of some drugs required to keep COVID-19 patients on ventilators are low enough that hospitals in Ontario are taking steps to conserve their use.     While hospitals say they are not facing an immediate shortage, the rate at which the most severely ill COVID-19 patients consume the drugs is raising fears that the existing supply of certain medications will run out in a matter of weeks. \"Certainly the potential is there for some very significant shortages in these medications,\" said Christina Adams, chief pharmacy officer of the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists.   \"Because we're seeing two to three times increase in the demand for these drugs, our [national] supply may only last a month or two before we really need to start looking at alternatives for resupply,\ " Adams said Tuesday in an interview with CBC News.   When putting someone on a ventilator, certain medications are crucial to sedate and immobilize the patient, and COVID-19 patients seem to require more of these drugs than other ventilated patients, says Damon Scales, chief of critical care medicine at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.   \"The whole world wants these same medications to provide the same therapy, so this is a real concern,\ " Scales said. Patients on ventilators must be deeply sedated and their chest muscles immobilized to prevent lung damage from the mechanical ventilation, said Scales.   \"We need to take the human being out of the equation so the machine and my team can do the work they need to do to help prevent the respiratory failure from worsening,\" he said.   According to the medical experts interviewed for this story, the specific drugs most at risk of shortage right now include:   propofol (a sedative). cisatracurium (a paralytic, or neuromuscular blocker).   rocuronium (a paralytic, or neuromuscular blocker).   All three are on a Health Canada list current drug scarcities with  \"the greatest potential impact on Canada's drug supply and health care system.\"  Individual hospitals are taking steps to preserve their supplies, such as choosing other medications for non-COVID patients, said Jin Huh, senior director of pharmacy for the University Health Network in Toronto. \"We've been working with the government, provincially as well as federally, as well as purchasing organizations to get a better understanding what the supply is out there and how quickly we could ramp up that supply,\" said Huh.   COVID-19 in Ontario: What you need to know Tuesday Pharmacists struggle to fill gaps in strained health-care system Medical sources tell CBC News the province has assigned health officials to tally the existing stocks of certain drugs at hospitals, to develop guidelines for conserving these medications and to identify wider sources of supply.   Ontario is working with pharmaceutical companies on the issue, said Health Minister Christine Elliott.   \"We're prepared to go and negotiate with other countries as well to get the active ingredients that we need in order to make these medications, because we know that there is going to be demand for them,\ " Elliott said in response to a question at a news conference Tuesday.    A provincial group focused on critical care in the COVID-19 pandemic is \"actively working with the Ministry [of Health] to identify and address local drug supply issues and to coordinate appropriate responses across Ontario hospitals,\" added Elliott's director of media relations, Hayley Chazan, in a later email to CBC News.    The hope is that physical distancing measures continue to rein in the spread of the virus enough to give time to build up the drug supply.

  Cape Breton food banks and soup kitchens are already making changes — or are considering when to implement them — in order to continue helping people in need in the face of challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Marco Amati, general manager of Loaves and Fishes in Sydney, said the soup kitchen has lots of food for now, but drastic changes had to be made starting on Monday. \"We usually have clients come in, sit down and have their meal,\" he said. \"Now, it's takeout, so we don't have any clients in the building, but we're still feeding people. \"This is a troubling time right now and we're all going through it together, but we'll make sure people are always going to get fed.\ " Amati said Loaves and Fishes is in good shape for food and supplies, but a number of volunteers have called and said they won't be coming in during the pandemic.

  Public health modelling predicts cases of COVID-19 could peak in Alberta in early May, Premier Jason Kenney said in an emergency debate in the legislature Wednesday night. The model predicts at the provincial peak, about 250 people will be in intensive care unit beds with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The calculations, prepared by Alberta Health Services (AHS) and still being adjusted, are also prompting the provincial government to prepare for a much more dire, worst-case scenario. That scenario would require 1,200 intensive care beds and 925 ventilators, which Alberta Health Services aims to have ready by late April, Kenney said. \"Things will get worse before they get better,\ " the premier said. \"I also want everyone to know that Alberta's pandemic response is second-to-none in North America.\ " He said the provincial health system has the resources, equipment and personnel it needs to cope with the peak of infections of the novel coronavirus.   Hospitals prepare for COVID-19 influx 'that will certainly test our capacity'   Delayed surgeries and other measures have allowed AHS to free up 1,300 hospital beds across the province, and there should be 2,250 available to treat COVID-19 patients by the third week of April, Kenney said. There were 509 ventilators available at last count, he said. Planning for worst-case scenario Although the premier said he was confident the public health measures to close businesses, prohibit large gatherings and keep people apart were succeeding at slowing the spread of the virus, the government is preparing for a more catastrophic scenario. It has plans to assemble \"backup facilities\" should the number of sick patients exceed hospital space and possibly call on the military to help prepare such buildings, Kenney said. Although AHS has a four-month supply of gloves, masks, gowns and other medical equipment, the province has ordered an additional two million N95 masks, Kenney said.   Alberta is also working with other provinces and the federal government to try and find sources of extra testing reagents and other critical supplies, he said. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley expressed several concerns to the premier and cabinet ministers, including that the emergency homeless shelters being set up in the province appear to have mats and beds in close proximity, which risks facilitating transmission of the virus. Scramble to add showers, laundry facilities at COVID-19 drop-in centre \"We believe these people, these people in Alberta who do not have homes, are entitled to the same dignity and the same rights as other Albertans,\ " Notley said. \"And we also believe that the kind of setup that we see these folks living in right now is bound to create a concentration of infections and disease spread.\" Notley said the provincial government will have to accelerate economic diversification when the pandemic subsides. She chastised the government for a prolonged battle with Alberta doctors over how physicians are paid. Alberta sees two more COVID-19 deaths, 117 new cases Notley also questioned how governments intended to help small businesses survive the economic crash and how seniors' lodges and long-term care homes are preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Canada's hospitals are counting their ventilators used to assist breathing in critically ill patients. A worst-case scenario model for Alberta predicts the province would need about 925 ventilators. (Craig Chivers/CBC) Kenney said the government is in talks with e-commerce platform Shopify to potentially help some Alberta businesses move online. He also said the provincial government would consider topping up a federal government emergency income payment of $2,000 a month. Oil price crash lobs $7-billion hit to provincial coffers Kenney also said the Canadian oil industry likely needs access to between $20- and $30-billion worth of cash to survive the global oil price war. He urged the federal government to come to the aid of the sector. Within two to three weeks, the price of Western Canadian Select — the type of oil extracted from the oilsands — may be negative, Kenney said. Without help, small and medium-sized energy companies are at risk of folding if oil prices remain in the gutter, he said. Kenney also said Alberta's projected revenue for the 2020-21 year is likely between $7 billion and $10 billion lower than budgeted. The province had forecast $50 billion in revenue for this year. However, Kenney said he expects an \"extraordinary federal investment\" in orphan well reclamation within days. Here's what the oilpatch wants in financial aid from Ottawa
  The dispatches from the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy are chilling.   \"Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone … Every ventilator becomes like gold.\" That was the message last week from Dr. Daniele Macchini, an Italian physician whose lengthy Facebook post was published in a local newspaper, translated into English and circulated on social media.   \"And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists; we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us,\" he wrote. Three professors from the University of Milan also sent a letter warning doctors in the rest of Europe to \"get ready,\" because 10 per cent of patients who test positive for COVID-19 end up needing intensive care.   \"This situation is like a bomb that explodes, and you're simply overwhelmed by an incredible number of patients,\" another Italian physician, Dr. Giacomo Grasselli, told the CBC News Network this week. WATCH | Italian doctor says coronavirus is like a bomb that exploded: Doctor at epicentre of Italian outbreak says coronavirus is a potential disaster for the entire world. 6:57 Grasselli is co-ordinating the intensive care response in Milan, the largest city in the country's hard-hit northern region. All of Italy's 60 million people are now under a sweeping lockdown, subject to travel and social restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Europe's worst outbreak of coronavirus. \"We're living this now,\" said Grasselli.  \"My mission is not only to take care of Italian patients, but also to tell other people in the world how to get ready for this.\" There's still time to 'flatten the curve'   Canada still has time to avoid such a situation, experts say. As the global number of coronavirus cases nears 120,000 people in 115 countries, chances of stopping its spread are now considered unlikely. So public health officials have turned their attention to slowing it down.   And the key is to \"flatten the curve\" — a reference to an epidemiological graph of a disease outbreak.   A large spike on that graph, representing a sudden increase in people with infections, can be catastrophic even for health-care systems in highly developed countries like Canada. This graph demonstrates the impact public health measures can have in 'flattening' the curve of a disease, slowing down virus transmission and easing pressure on the health-care system.   (CBC News) \"If you can slow it down enough and flatten the curve, so the same number of people get infected, but over a much longer period of time, then ... what you're allowing is that the capacity will not be exceeded,\" said Dr. Anand Kumar, a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Science Centre.   \"And that protects the community, so that an ICU bed will be available when it's needed.\"   Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus Extreme measures: European governments pull out the stops to slow COVID-19   Most healthy people will experience a mild COVID-19 infection because their immune system will protect them. But so far, the experience in Italy and China suggests that as many as 10 per cent of people infected can require critical care.   That creates an urgent need for beds in intensive care units, along with ventilation, dialysis and other life support technology.  It also requires qualified health-care specialists to manage patients — excess capacity that Canadian hospitals just don't have.   We're at capacity most of the time.- Dr. Robert Fowler, critical care physician and researcher Most of the country's hospitals are already operating at 100 per cent capacity, a largely normal situation in Canada's health-care system.   \"We've got a system that is designed to meet what our usual demands are,\" said Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital. \"We're at capacity most of the time.\" Add to that the extra load from this year's bad flu season, and suddenly, even in Canada, there's a risk that care might not be available when patients need it. \"Ideally, you prevent people from being infected — but you certainly don't want to have everybody infected at once,\" said Fowler. \"We don't want to overwhelm the system.\ " But the Italians warn that could happen.   \"If you do not stop the spread of the disease, your health system — no matter how good, how efficient, how modern it is — sooner or later will collapse,\" said Grasselli. \"Because the number of patients is too high for the resources we have everywhere in the world.\" Customers complain of price gouging as hand sanitizer sells out in storesCancel some events, but COVID-19 shouldn't force moratorium on all public gatherings, experts say That's why in Canada (and elsewhere) large events are being cancelled, some people are being told to work from home, and some students will be taking courses online for a few weeks. It's a temporary public health strategy aimed at slowing the potential spread and buying time. \"That's what people are trying to do to try to prevent the spread right now so we don't get overwhelmed,\" said Fowler. \"And it's going to very much depend on how effective we are at preventing transmission in the community.\" Dr. Anand Kumar is a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre. He said 'flattening the curve' of COVID-19 infections in Canada will ensure that critical care beds are available for everyone who needs one.   (John Woods/The Canadian Press) Another complicating factor is the fact that there is no vaccine and there are no drugs to treat COVID-19.   \"In this particular circumstance, we're not going to have a vaccine for at least a year, if not a year-and-a-half,\" said Kumar. \"And there's no known antiviral drug for coronavirus, so essentially all we can offer is supportive care.   \"If you get mildly ill, there's not something we can give you to stop you from getting severely ill. So what's going to happen is going to happen. And we're just going to have to try to support patients as best we can.\ " The importance of beds, ventilators Fowler led a team of researchers that conducted a survey of Canada's critical-care capacity after the 2009 H1N1 epidemic. At the time, there were about 3,200 ICU beds and almost 5,000 mechanical ventilators spread out in 286 hospitals across Canada. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines that will be critical for COVID-19 patients whose lungs are so badly damaged they have trouble getting enough oxygen.   The survey concluded that intensive care resources vary widely across Canada and \"during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients.\" Ontario, for example, had an extra 209 ventilators stockpiled and spread out across the province as of last August, according to one provincial document.    Canada's hospitals are counting their ventilators, used to assist breathing in critically ill patients. Experts warn that Canadian hospitals have limited space and capacity. That's why slowing the spread of COVID-19 is important to preserve that capacity.    (Craig Chivers/CBC) \"The physical space within a hospital to care for people is, I think, probably even more challenging beyond the physical number of ventilators,\" said Fowler.   Kumar is particularly concerned about the number of qualified staff to handle a possible surge in patients.   \"The bottleneck is in manpower, even more than physical space and even ventilators,\ " he said. \"I think everybody is contingency planning for the possibilities.\ " Some of the challenges now relate to approaching the management of COVID-19 on a national scale — and being ready to help regions that are hit harder, experts say.  That may involve moving equipment and health-care workers to where they are most urgently needed. A Newfoundlander is leading the global fight against COVID-19, and wants you to know the factsAnalysisIn 2003, Canada failed the pandemic test. Here's what we've learned since \"There's patchiness in where these outbreaks hit,\" said Fowler.  That means doctors and nurses can be completely overwhelmed in one place, but it can be business as usual in the rest of the country.   In Italy, health-care workers are already talking about the grim reality of \"triaging\" under strained circumstances, which means they're being forced to choose between life and what might have been a preventable death for some people, based on the availability of ventilators and ICU beds. Canada has studied the concept of such triaging, but Fowler said so far no system has been established.   \"In Canada, we don't really have a working example of what that would look like and we haven't had to do that,\ " he said. \"We shouldn't be having that conversation ahead of the conversation about when a place gets busy, how can we bring support.\"  
  Jody Lund is stepping away from a career in film production and jumping back into his scrubs to help battle back against the COVID-19 pandemic. A few years ago, Lund said he left his stressful job as a respiratory therapist to try something completely different, and signed up for a film and video production program. But when the COVID-19 crisis hit, Lund said he starting thinking about helping out by returning to his old job in the intensive care unit. Then his old boss called him to ask just that, formally requesting that he help run potentially life-saving ventilators. \"I feel like, especially when the system is so burdened like this, every little bit helps,\ " Lund said. \"I already know that there's lots of open shifts. They're trying to find people to fill these open shifts.\ " Ventilators have been key to helping COVID-19 patients keep breathing. Alberta Health Services said about 400 retired respiratory therapists and nurses and about 46 doctors have been willing to come out of retirement. (Felipe Dana/The Associated Press, File) Hundreds of retirees step up So far, about 46 doctors have come out of retirement to help during the pandemic, according to Alberta Health Services. The agency has also heard from 400 retired respiratory therapists, licensed practical nurses and registered nurses who are willing to help. \"AHS is extremely grateful and is in the process of evaluating those who have offered their services,\ " reads a statement provided by AHS to CBC News. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada? Lund said he stepped up because he knows that in addition to ventilators, the health system also needs people to run them. Alberta is working on multiple fronts to ensure it has an excess of ventilators when COVID-19 peaks, Premier Jason Kenney has said.

Here's how different masks compare: See how different masks compare. (CBC News Graphics) Lund said he knows there's a good chance he could contract the novel coronavirus, but said the benefits outweigh the risks. But Lund added it's crucial that he has the necessary personal protective equipment to stay safe. \"I'm not willing to put myself at that great of risk to walk into a patient's room unprotected,\ " he said. 
  Health officials in the farthest west portion of Ontario have reason to believe the region will not be inundated with COVID-19 patients. Communities in the Northwestern Health Unit (NWHU) have nine reported positive cases of COVID-19, with virtually all of them being travel related. Manitobans asked to skip weekends at northwestern Ontario camps Nearly 350 tests have come back as negative, with about 230 tests still being analyzed. \"I think this is a good sign. I think we are still behind in the curve here, so we do have time before we are dealing with this wave that is now largely affecting other parts of Ontario,\" said Dr. Ian Gemmill, the acting medical officer of health for the NWHU. Gemmill said he is hopeful people with seasonal homes will continue to heed the message that travel between northwestern Ontario and other regions is considered unnecessary. He said one of his largest concerns is seasonal residents coming to the region, falling ill, and then requiring care which, \"would be chaotic for health services.\"'Lapping at our shores' : Small and remote hospitals anxiously await a COVID-19 influx Gemmill re-iterated that the region can likely handle the COVID-19 cases for people who live in the area and become sick from the virus, but not an influx of people from elsewhere. More testing Gemmill, along with Ray Racette, the president and CEO of the Lake of the Woods District Hospital said they look forward to the provincial government increasing the amount of testing for the virus. Racette said the hospital supplies the testing kits in Kenora, and he envisions seven sites being set up for testing, as far away as Sioux Narrows. Manitobans could overwhelm cottage country if they vacation during pandemic, health officials warn He said there is no specific number of tests he wants to see administered in the area, but said a figure in the thousands would be appropriate, with local labs, once they are equipped and approved to analyze the swabs, able to deliver local results in a matter of hours. \"That's ultimately going to come as an additional area of service, and certainly Thunder Bay is looking at that, as we are, as is Sioux Lookout. We are looking at the opportunity as well to send specimens into Manitoba.\" Racette said the region's distance from other major centres gives it an advantage in learning best practices on managing the virus from other areas. He said the hospital is still working on reducing its occupancy, but is still dealing with some staffing shortages because of employees in self-isolation. Racette said the hospital has seven ventilators and 12 ICU beds ready for any admitted cases of COVID-19. He said the hospital is also looking at creating COVID positive and non-positive units as well. The other major challenge for the hospital is that it has only received about 20 per cent of its personal protective equipment, Racette said. He also noted the Keewatin Arena will be ready to accept people in precarious situations this week, by creating a space for 30 people to reside if they need to self-isolate, adding it is meant to be a temporary measure and will be transformed back into an arena by mid to end of June. 
  The London Health Sciences Foundation (LHSF) has received a generous number of donations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to support London hospitals and front-line workers. Local businesses and organizations have stepped up in a big way with donations of personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and cash contributions. The LHSF set up a COVID-19 fund last month, dedicated to helping London's medical workers who are dealing with the virus first hand. Since the fund was established just a few weeks ago, nearly $500,000 has been raised. \"We've received about 100 calls or emails a day from people wanting to support our COVID-19 fund and specifically to support our front-line workers,\" said John MacFarlane, president and CEO of the LHSF. \"It's been a really amazing show of support.\" UpdatedExplosion of COVID-19 cases at London seniors' home as testing increases MacFarlane said the majority of the financial donations have come in the way of smaller contributions from Londoners wanting to help. The funds will be used to purchase life-saving equipment, such as PPEs, ventilators, ultrasound machines and Glidescopes. Answering a call for PPE, General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada gifted 14 ventilators to London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC), along with 860 N95 masks. The company said the equipment was originally intended for use in their light armoured vehicle ambulance variant, but will now go to the hospitals. General Dynamics Land Systems donated 14 ventilators and 860 N95 masks to London hospitals. (Ed Middleton/CBC) McCormick Canada, a London food manufacturer, also donated 1,000 N95 masks to the LHSC at the beginning of April. The LHSF says many other donations have been contributed by London District Catholic School Board, Western University, VersaBank and more. A number of hospital beds have been donated from the Faculty of Health Sciences Arthur Labatt Family School of Nursing and the School of Physical Therapy as well as critical care ventilators from the Fanshawe College Respiratory Therapy Program. What it's like working at one of London's COVID-19 assessment centres \"The list goes on,\" said MacFarlane. \"We, the foundation and the hospital, just can't thank the community enough for all they are doing in this real time of crisis and at the end of the day, we all want to support the true heroes, and those are the front-line health care workers.\" Donations to the LHSF can be made or arranged by visiting their website. 
  Research teams around the world have two weeks to come up with a simple and efficient ventilator design in a contest launched by the Montreal General Hospital Foundation and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. Upon seeing dozens of pleas for more ventilators from physicians in Italy, the country now hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, McGill University associate Prof. Reza Farivar of opthamology, decided it was time to take action. Farivar, who holds the Canada research chair in integrated neuroscience, said with technology such as 3D printers readily available, manufacturing new ventilators might be possible — they're just missing the design. \"One could conceivably come up with an easy-to-deploy design and simple-to-use design that could serve at least the COVID outbreak,\ " he said.   Ventilator manufacturer says Canada should have stockpiled machines after SARS  Dr. Reza Farivar, an associate professor of opthamology at McGill University and the Canada research chair in integrated neuroscience, launched the contest after reading about the worldwide shortage of ventilators to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients. (Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre) Contestants are being asked to submit a design that could be manufactured locally — using a 3D printer, for instance — and easily tested. Once the top three finalists are chosen, their designs will be made available, for free, for anyone to use worldwide. Whichever design works best will be awarded a $200,000 cash prize. The deadline for submissions is March 31, and Farrivar expects to announce a winner by April 15. Demand for ventilators soars The contest is open to research teams all over the world, although each team must include at least one medical professional and one engineer. \"This is a global crisis that we have to deal with,\" said Farrivar. \"There's no way of predicting where the best ideas are going to come from.\ " Ventilators are in high demand as the number of critical cases of COVID-19 worldwide soars. The mechanical breathing machines are needed for COVID-19 patients whose lungs are so badly damaged they have trouble getting enough oxygen.   Data from both China and Italy shows that about five per cent of patients who became ill in those countries required mechanical ventilation in intensive care to help them breathe. And while patients in intensive care for other health reasons are usually only on ventilators for a few days, some studies have shown that COVID-19 patients often need to be on ventilators for up to 15 days. Hospitals scramble to secure more ventilators amid coronavirus outbreakOntario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half: study A new study shows Canada's most populated province, Ontario, which has about 1,300 ventilators, could run out quickly if the trajectory of the pandemic is similar to that in Italy. Hospitals are looking at creative solutions: Dr. Alain Gauthier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital near Ottawa, has rigged up ventilators to be able to ventilate two patients at once instead of one. Quebec's health care network is relatively well-equipped, with about 3,000 ventilators in total, including those in intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms and on neonatal units. Nevertheless, intensive care specialists in Quebec are worried about both the availability of ventilators, and nurses and respiratory therapists trained to operate them. 
  President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States was heading into what could be its \"toughest\" weeks as coronavirus cases swell nationwide, and he warned states not to inflate their needs for critical medical equipment. \"There will be a lot of death, unfortunately. There will be death,\ " Trump said in a somber start to his daily briefing on the pandemic. Trump was joined by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, virus task force co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's foremost infection disease expert. Each stood far apart from one another on the small stage. Trump said the goal was to stay several days ahead of critical medical needs in each state. But he also suggested that states were asking for more medical supplies than they really needed. \"The fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests,\" Trump said. Watch:  Trump discusses order of 180 million N95 masks: In a Saturday press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump said 3M is making 180 million N95 masks for the United States. 2:26 Louisiana officials have said New Orleans is on track to run out of ventilators by next week. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state is at the epicentre of the national pandemic with over 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning, has pleaded for ventilators for days and lambasted what he has said is insufficient help from the federal government. New York is poised to get more than 1,100 ventilators from China and Oregon. ' We have to vanquish the virus' Trump also revisited a familiar message, saying he wants to get the economy up and running as soon as possible. At one point during the unfolding outbreak, Trump said he had hoped to open up businesses by Easter, April 12. He later acknowledged that was not possible, ceding the month of April after seeing rising death toll projections. \"We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can. ... We have to get back to work,\ " he said. Watch: Canadian politicians slam Trump over masks Provincial and municipal leaders are criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for attempting to halt exports of N95 masks to Canada. 4:52 The number of people infected in the U.S. has exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000; more than 3,500 of those deaths are in New York. Much of the country is under orders to stay home, including professional sports leagues that were among the first to clamp down in the pandemic. Trump on Saturday spoke with commissioners of the country's sports leagues. He said he told them that he recognizes \"the good work being done by many teams and players\" to care for their communities and fan bases dealing with the outbreak. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on April 4 The virus has decimated the sports world with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League suspending their seasons indefinitely and Major League Baseball postponing the start of its season. Trump hopes pro sports will resume soon The NCAA basketball tournament was also cancelled, as were college spring sports such as baseball and softball, lacrosse and track and field. A wide range of sports leaders participated in the call, including Roger Goodell of the National Football League and the NBA's Adam Silver. Trump called on them to continue efforts to support their fellow Americans. Trump said he wants to see sports fans back in arenas \"as soon as we can, obviously.\" \"I can't tell you a date, but I think it's going to be sooner rather than later,\ " he said. Before the briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, criticized the decision by Trump to nominate \"one of his own lawyers,\" as an inspector general overseeing federal aid during the coronavirus recovery. She said the watchdog monitoring \"this historic relief package for workers and families must be independent from politics.\ " Watch: What happens if U.S. blocks N95 mask exports to Canada: U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered U.S.-based company 3M to stop exporting masks.

He currently serves as a special assistant to the president and as senior associate counsel in the White House. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is overseeing the government package that aims to shovel $2.2 trillion US into the U.S. economy over the next few weeks to try to cushion the free fall. The assistance includes $349 billion US in loans for small businesses and a $500 billion US corporate rescue fund.

She said a new House committee on the virus response would work to ensure \"taxpayer dollars are being used wisely and efficiently to help workers and not to be exploited by profiteers and price-gougers.\" For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. 
  We're breaking down what you need to know about the pandemic. Send your questions to covid@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish some answers every weekday online, and we're also putting some questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network. Today we're tackling queries from overdue rent penalties to dating during the pandemic.    I am dating someone. Are we really expected to act like we're in a long-distance relationship until this blows over? There are new rules when it comes to dating during a pandemic. Couples who don't live under the same roof should practise physical distancing.  This means no face-to-face romance. \"This actually forces relationship dynamics a bit,\" says infectious disease specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger.  She says couples who live separately are not considered a household unit, and should continue physical distancing.  You can hear more of her answer in The National segment at the bottom of this article. But there's a bright side for some couples.  Carolyn Alexander, founder of Singles in the Peg, a platform for Winnipeg singles, says she and her boyfriend have been spending a lot of time playing board games and \"enjoying the simpler things in life,\" while isolating.   She says self-isolation is also helping her relationship get to the next level — they're also talking about getting married. Read more of her story here. Should I wear a face mask, if I don't have COVID-19 symptoms? We received a lot of questions about masks including one from Robin S. who wants to know whether to wear one, if one is asymptomatic. Here's what we know: The guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and public health officials in Canada suggests masks are not necessary for healthy people, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus. But other health officials have contradicted that advice, including the head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, who called the North American and European approach \"a big mistake.\ " \"You've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, and if they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others,\" said George Gao, the centre's director, in a recent Science article.   WATCH  | Why you're probably not wearing your mask correctly  Canadian officials have expressed concern about the risk of not using masks properly, because people who touch their faces a lot can increase the spread of the coronavirus. That's one reason why masks are not recommended for the general public. However, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Monday that Ottawa is open to reconsidering its advice.  Read more about the mask debate. My landlords have offered to defer my rent, to be repaid with interest. Is this legal?   It's April 1, and how to pay the rent is on the minds of many including Crystal C. from Vancouver who is wondering whether her landlords can charge interest on deferred rent. In B.C., landlords are permitted to charge some late fees when rent is not paid on time. But it also depends on the agreement tenants have with their landlords. Will Gladman, legal advocate from the Vancouver Tenants Union, says he doesn't see why charging interest would be illegal, because parties set terms when entering a tenancy agreement. \"Nothing prohibits that kind of arrangement,\" he says.  But he recommends tenants not enter this kind of arrangement in the first place.   But evictions in most of Canada, including B.C., are on pause due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Tenancy laws are province specific. For example, landlords in Ontario are not able to charge late fees and must instead issue notices of eviction if payments are not made on time, says Caryma Sa'd, a landlord and tenant lawyer in Toronto.   \"So this offer out in B.C. is an interesting proposition because the landlord can't actually do anything at the moment anyways,\ " Sa'd says.   The situation on paying rent is changing rapidly, but here are some province-specific resources below. CBC News will also be releasing more information on this in the coming days, so check back here, and we'll post a link. (B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., Nunavut, Yukon and N.W.T.) Can I safely cook and bake for friends? Many have a lot more time on our hands, and that means more time in the kitchen. Maybe that's why we received an email about whether it's safe to cook and bake for friends during the COVID-19 crisis.   While one recent study suggests the virus persists on many surfaces, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says \"there is currently no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus.\ "  Infectious disease specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger in Edmonton says the bigger concern is how the food is delivered. \"To me , it's all about the plating and the handling of the packaging, not the food itself,\ " she said, since the virus is more likely live on those surfaces, if at all.  You can hear more in The National video below. Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus in Canada, including whether you can safely cook or bake for others while physical distancing. 4:25 Do we really know how many Canadians have COVID-19?    Gary W. is wondering whether COVID-19 statistics can be trusted, if mild cases are not being tested? Every day, Canadians are bombarded with fresh numbers about the pandemic from around the world. However, like most statistics, the numbers can only reveal part of the story. As Gary suggests, not everyone is being tested. There aren't enough tests for everyone who is feeling ill, and the coronavirus can be spread by people who aren't sick enough to seek medical help. Even then, in many cases, not all sick people are being tested. Some provinces have been testing more than others and their numbers might look higher, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have more cases. It might just mean they're testing more and identifying more cases. Provinces are counting cases in different ways. There isn't a common definition for what is identified as a case, either. If you expand this to a global scale, you can see how differing medical strategies and data-collection tactics make drawing international comparisons particularly challenging. \"It's extremely difficult to make these comparisons,\" said Saverio Stranges, chair of epidemiology and biostatistics at Western University's Schulich School. That said, the numbers can give us a part of the story and give us trends to reflect on. Read this primer on making sense of the numbers and listen to a breakdown of down Canada's COVID-19 numbers on Front Burner.   We're also answering your questions every night on The National.

  The Canadian military will mobilize up to 24,000 full-time and part-time members to respond to calls from provinces and northern Indigenous communities for help with pandemic measures, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Monday. The military's \"rapid reaction\" teams will be available for a range of missions, such as delivering medical supplies and supporting remote communities that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. \"When Canada needs our Armed Forces, they're always there,\ " Sajjan said today during the daily ministerial briefing. \"They've shown that in great times of difficulty, Canadians never face hardship alone.\" At least 10 regular force units on bases across the country have troops and equipment set aside to take action. A few weeks ago, whole sections of the military were ordered to stay home and stay healthy in case they're needed. \"Those who wear the uniform will be there for Canadians when called upon,\ " Sajjan said. Chief of Defence Staff Jonathan Vance and Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan listen to a question during a news conference in Ottawa, Monday, March 30, 2020. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) The announcement is the first concrete indication the Liberal government is prepared to call on troops to deliver humanitarian relief, including medical assistance, within Canada. The role of the Armed Forces in the COVID-19 crisis thus far has been limited to providing medical teams to screen evacuees from China, and to providing those people with isolation shelter at the country's largest military air base in Trenton, Ont. At the moment, no formal requests for what's known as \"aid to the civil power\" have been submitted to the federal government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday during his daily press briefing outside of his home at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa. The military's humanitarian interventions would revolve around helping to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus, delivering humanitarian supplies and supporting provinces and municipalities with things like transport and communications to keep local governments functioning. \"We're going to be able to respond either with specialist capabilities like medical and logistics engineers for short duration or for longer-duration events, depending upon what the need of the provinces is,\" said Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defence staff. Local commanders given leeway The military teams also could backstop other federal or provincial government departments by performing virus checks under an enhanced testing regime. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said that, broadly, his province is seeing people comply with stay-at-home orders, but there are some going to beaches and parks and he wants it to stop.   \"We're doing to clamp down on that, we are going to enforce that. Now, do I think I need the military right now to enforce that? I'd like to say no, but we want to keep people apart, we want to keep people in their homes and we want to ensure that essential services can operate in a safe manner for employees.\ " \"I'm not ready for the military just yet but I have been talking to the base commander and they're certainly on standby to assist us in any way that they can,\" said Higgs. \"I'm open to any possibility to keep our citizens safe and healthy.\ " N.B. Premier <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ BlaineHiggs?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@BlaineHiggs</a> said he’s not ready for the military to enforce physical distancing rules, but he has talked to the base commander about how the military can assist in dealing with the pandemic. “ I’m open to any possibility to keep our citizens safe and healthy.” <a href=\"https://t.co /L7YYB9V8ca\">pic.twitter.com/L7YYB9V8ca</a>&mdash;@PnPCBC Quebec authorities have called on public health institutions and police to help enforce local quarantines. The military also has the potential to backstop such orders, but Sajjan sidestepped a reporter's question Monday about whether the government is prepared to allow that. He said \"each unique circumstance\" will dictate what the military does, but local commanders will have the flexibility to do what's necessary. The navy has designated warships that will be prepared to respond on short notice to coastal communities that might need help, the defence department said in a statement late Monday. In the Pacific, the frigate HMCS Regina and the coastal defence vessel HMCS Brandon, currently conducting training exercises at sea, have been assigned to pandemic response. HMCS Ville de Québec, another patrol frigate, and HMCS Moncton are being readied on the East Coast. Crew members from both of those ships will be sequestered in a Halifax hotel prior to their departure to ensure they don't contract the virus. HMCS Regina conducts a replenishment at sea with U.S. Naval Ship Patuxent in the Gulf of Aden on Dec. 4, 2012. (Cpl. Rick Ayer/National Defence) Crews being isolated \"Different options were considered to isolate the crews, including keeping them onboard their respective ships or housing them in accommodations at CFB Halifax, however the civilian hotel option was selected because it provides the most flexibility and the best chance to reduce the risk of our sailors becoming infected with COVID-19 as much as possible,\" said the military statement. \"We recognize this will be very difficult on our sailors and their families, being in Halifax but not being able to be together.\ " A date for them to begin their isolation hasn't been set, as arrangements are being made with the hotel. The Canadian air force is continuing with search and rescue operations and NORAD flights, but the defence department said it has put in place strict guidelines for aircrew and technical crew traveling on operations. \"They must be asymptomatic and follow strict measures for the wearing of [Personal Protective Equipment], as well as infection prevention and control protocols,\" the statement said. The U.S. Air Force has been shuttling COVID-19 test kits to various parts of the country, while the Pentagon has turned thousands of ventilators over to overstretched civilian hospitals. While the Canadian military has transport capacity to move supplies around, it does not have an oversupply of medical equipment and personal protective equipment. The Americans also have used their combat engineers to help extend hospital infrastructure to support more patients. AnalysisAre Canadians ready for sustained sacrifices in the age of COVID-19? We're about to find outAnalysisMilitarizing a pandemic: Defence experts say idea of sending U.S. troops to border makes no senseIndigenous pandemic needs grow as federal funds prepare to flow Recently, the Italian military employed specialists to help the country increase production of medically-necessary ventilators that help the most critically-ill patients breathe. It also deployed soldiers to help move bodies in one northern Italian town where the mortuary was overwhelmed. Reservists and Canadian Rangers — the Indigenous force that patrols remote northern regions — will be brought into full-time service, Sajjan said. The government is particularly worried about northern and remote communities where access to health care is limited and critical infrastructure is maintained by only a few individuals. The Department of National Defence has been in conversation with some northern communities about their pandemic needs, Sajjan said. Each request for military help will be evaluated based on need, not geography, the minister added. 
  Alberta's supply of ventilators, intensive care beds and personal protective equipment should be sufficient to handle a projected peak next month in COVID-19 cases, according to modelling information released Wednesday. Under the most likely scenario, first revealed by Premier Jason Kenney in a televised address on Tuesday, Alberta would see as many as 800,000 confirmed and suspected infections and between 400 to 3,100 deaths by the end of the summer. The peak in cases is projected to occur in the middle of May. Under that scenario, the peak of hospitalization would be in late May, with about 818 Albertans requiring hospitalization. About 232 patients would be expected to require critical care by late May and early June. \"Modelling is an estimate based on the best known data at the time that the model is put together,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. \"But we will continue to adjust it based on emerging Alberta data and evidence. So you will ... see this model evolving over time.\" Albertans can help bring the numbers down further by following public health rules aimed at preventing spread of the virus, she added.   \"Changing our total infections in the province is in our hands,\ " Hinshaw said. \"Every action makes a difference.\"   The province updated its COVID-19 case numbers before the start of the news conference. Alberta reported 50 new cases Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 1,423. Three more deaths were reported, bringing the total so far to 29. There have been 519 recoveries. Ramping up health-system response As a precaution, Alberta is ramping up its ICU, ventilator and personal protective equipment capacity based on an elevated, but less likely scenario.   Under the elevated scenario, 1,570 Albertans would require hospital beds by the beginning of May, with 392 of those cases requiring intensive care.   The elevated model would see as many as one million infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. System couldn't handle 'extreme' scenario An extreme model, with 1.6 million infections and 16,000 to 32,000 total deaths was provided to show how the virus would have spread if Alberta had not taken mitigation measures like closing businesses, schools and public buildings, and encouraging people to stay home. Alberta's health system would not be able to handle this scenario.    The information released on Wednesday outlines the assumptions used by health officials to come up with their models.   The most likely scenario includes an assumption that each person with COVID-19 will infect one to two other people. Other assumptions include that not all cases will be detected, that there is no asymptomatic transmission, and that patients are infectious for 5 to 10 days.   For the purposes of health system planning, the scenarios assume all ICU patients will need the use of a ventilator and that generally, 14 per cent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, with five per cent needing time in intensive care.   Unlike other jurisdictions that have used data from other places to project the spread of the virus, Alberta is using data gathered through its own testing and surveillance. Officials say the models are fluid and will change as new information comes in. More ICU beds ready by late April Alberta plans to have an additional 1,081 ICU beds ready by the end of April, and another 447 ventilators, bringing the total number of ventilators set aside for COVID-19 patients from 314 to 761. The additional ventilators are coming from a number of sources, including the respiratory therapy programs at NAIT and SAIT, STARS air ambulance, private surgical facilities and the Public Health Agency of Canada.   Transport, anaesthetic and pediatric devices that can be used for mechanical ventilation account for another 305 units; another 65 are new purchases by the province.   The stock of personal protective equipment is more than sufficient through to the end of April and into May. Alberta Health Services is showing shortages for the month of June, but officials say that doesn't account for the orders expected to be filled by then.    The province is adding an additional 315 acute care beds by the end of April by measures which include postponing non-urgent procedures. Alberta Health Services intends to increase staffing in the ICU by ramping up training for nurses, hiring recently retired health care workers, and moving nurse graduates through their practicums so they can start working. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the government should be planning for a worst-case scenario and she repeated her call for the government to take over staffing of seniors' homes, and prevent employees from working at more than one site.   Notley is also concerned of reports from health-care workers that they are being encouraged to wash and reuse their N95 masks.   \"There's a shortage, we need to start being honest about that,\ " she said.   While AHS believes it has enough supply of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), AHS CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said they also have to be careful. Yiu said the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommendations for sterilization and reuse of N95 masks.   Kenney has asked AHS to \"go as big as they can\" in procuring supplies.  He said Alberta is prepared to share with other provinces if they get more PPE than required.   ' I hope the models are wrong' In an address to Albertans on Tuesday evening, Kenney outlined two possible scenarios for the pandemic in Alberta. Modelling suggests as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections could sweep Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney says OPINION | Kenney delivers a stark but necessary message to Albertans Under the \"probable\" scenario, Alberta would hit the peak of infections in mid-May. From the beginning of the outbreak to the end of summer the province could see up to 800,000 total infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths. Under a more serious but less likely \"elevated\" scenario, infections in Alberta would peak at the beginning of May, with as many as one million total infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. In his widely watched Tuesday address, Kenney said public health orders designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus may have to stay in place until the end of May. \"As hard as this will be, it is the only ethical choice when thousands of lives are still at stake,\ " Kenney said. \"To be honest, I hope the models are wrong.\ "
  Click here for the latest: COVID-19 in Sask: Top doc recommends expanding testing to those who haven't travelled   There are now 72 cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, up from 66 on Monday.   Of those cases, four are instances of community transmission: cases where no clear cause of exposure, including travel, has been found. Two of the community transmission cases are in Saskatoon, one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community. An early, worst-case scenario drafted by the province says as many as 15,000 Saskatchewan residents may die from the virus. The estimate is a necessary part of planning and is being refined, the province says. More ventilators are on order, but the health minister said he doesn't know when they'll arrive.   An internal document from the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) says that, even using conservative assumptions, \"COVID-19 will almost certainly overwhelm\" the province's health system. The 20-page presentation, titled COVID-19 Planning Doc: Strategy for Continuity of Health Services and Surge Capacity, was recently circulated among SHA employees, but was leaked to the media Tuesday.   It raises serious questions about the province's current readiness to combat the COVID-19 virus.   \"Demand for acute services will exceed existing capacity for hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators as well as creating a major burden on other acute services, supports, HR, supplies, and equipment,\ " read one page from the PowerPoint presentation, which is dated March 19-20.    Saskatchewan government failed to order key equipment and supplies until after COVID-19 arrived   1st sign of community transmission The document's release came on the same day Saskatchewan reached a new milestone in its continued fight against the coronavirus. The province confirmed four cases of community transmission — instances where health officials could not determine how people got exposed. Two of those cases are in Saskatoon, one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community.

Here's how the cases break down regionally as of March 24:   (CBC) Here's how the number of cases in Saskatchewan has increased over the past two weeks:  'Worst-case scenario planning'   A health authority spokesperson said Tuesday the internal document was \"a draft document based on early modelling and worst case scenarios.\"  Read the full document here.    A statement made last week by the province's chief medical health officer suggests the document — which posits a 30 per cent infection rate — may not actually depict the worst possible scenario. \"Over the course of 12 to 18 months, 30 to 70 per cent of us will get COVID-19,\ " Shahab said at March 18 news conference.   The internal document does note \"more accurate modelling is anticipated in the coming days,\" but says that action must be taken regardless. \"Even if there was a 50 per cent error rate, we still need to do this,\ " it says. In a note Tuesday afternoon, the SHA said other jurisdictions have used a 30 per cent infection rate in their models, but added that the Saskatchewan model is being updated so it's \"more specific to the situation in Saskatchewan.\" \"This plan will ensure we are prepared,\" said Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the health authority, in the note. \"But it won't be enough.  It has been proven over and over with this virus that no health system in the world can address this challenge alone without the sustained help [physical distancing and self-isolation] of the general public.\" Steps already taken At the news conference, Livingstone said the document did not take into account what the province has already done to prepare. That includes a slowdown of non-essential medical procedures to make more beds available, the shifting of health-care workers across the province and increased COVID-19 testing. \"We're doing surveillance in hospitals, testing for COVID-19 in all declared outbreaks in long term care homes,\ " Livingstone added.   Questions remain, however, about the readiness of the province's hospital system, especially when it comes to ventilators. Saskatchewan currently has 91 adult intensive care ventilators, 80 subacute ventilators and dozens of ventilators inside operating rooms across the provide, said Dr. Susan Shaw, the SHA's chief medical officer.    Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators.- Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter The document estimated Saskatoon alone would need between 500 to 600 ventilators once the pandemic reaches its peak.   Some 250 ventilators are on order for the province, health officials have said.  But Health Minister Jim Reiter was unsure Tuesday when they would arrive, and how many. \"Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators,\ " Reiter said. \"We're dealing with our normal suppliers, we're dealing the federal government because they're trying to co-ordinate and do bulk purchasing. \"I'm optimistic we're going to get some. I don't know if it'll be full orders and again it's virtually impossible.\ " Health Minister Jim Reiter said the province is working with the federal government to try to get ventilators at a time when many other countries are trying to do the same.   (THE CANADIAN PRESS) Up to 15,000 deaths estimated One page of the internal document, titled \"Key takeaways on incoming demand,\" estimates 9,000 to 15,000 people will die from the virus in the province. \"Early social distancing will delay and lessen the peak of the outbreak. However, even under conservative assumptions, COVID-19 will almost certainly overwhelm the health system.\" The same page says that \"over the course of the event,\" if 30 per cent of the province's population is infected, approximately 15,000 people will require ICU beds.   It says Saskatchewan currently has 109 intensive-care (ICU) beds province-wide. As of Monday, the health authority had 91 ventilators, with more on order.   \"At the peak of the pandemic, Saskatoon will need the capacity to provide ventilatory support [for] nearly 500-600 patients daily (ventilation and non-invasive ventilation),\" according to the document. The document also outlines a plan to significantly expand COVID-19 bed capacity to around 2,900 beds through the use of field hospitals at potential sites including gymnasiums, leased commercial space, community centres and arenas. The first step, however, is to increase the number of beds at existing hospitals, where specifics areas will be reserved for COVID-19 patients, Livingstone said during the news conference.   The province's mission statement is stated as follows in the document: \"SHA acute services will adapt and expand to meet the projected COVID-19 patient demand while continuing to deliver acute services to non-pandemic patients throughout the duration of the pandemic in order to minimize loss of life.\" One page suggests using rinks to house casualties.

So if we do the things we're doing now, that's the kind of numbers we might expect to see. But we don't have to see that. This is a critical moment. This is the moment at which we decide which track we're on.\ "  First recoveries expected soon Some good news about the pandemic's status in Saskatchewan may come by the end of the week, Shahab said.   \"We are now at the point where some of our initial cases are going to be screened,\ " Shahab said Monday. \"And if they are well, they'll be reported as recovered. We will be getting that information towards the end of this week.\ " The province announced its first case of the novel coronavirus on March 12: a 60-year-old man who had recently travelled to Egypt and tested positive in Saskatoon on March 9. Patients will be declared recovered once they test negative on a subsequent test, the health ministry has previously said.   As of Friday — when there were only 26 reported cases — the vast majority of those cases (24) were well enough to self-isolate at home.   No such insights have been offered since. Regular updates on in-hospital patients coming On Monday, Shahab said updates on how many cases are in hospital versus how many are self-isolating at home will be provided at least twice a week.   There are at least two COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan hospitals, according to the latest information provided. Both are there because of pre-existing medical conditions. However, the Saskatchewan Health Authority has not answered whether either of those cases has needed to go into intensive care, citing patient privacy concerns. Shaw said Monday that she did not have that information, and that if she did, \"it would not be appropriate to share it because of the importance of protecting our patients' personal health information.\ " In a later note, Jim Billington, press secretary for Premier Scott Moe, said \"it is our intent to provide information for the total number of cases in hospital and the total number of cases requiring ICU admission, when the information is reported [to the minister by the Saskatchewan Health Authority].\" CBC News has directly re-asked the health authority whether any patients are now under intensive care. As of Tuesday, 5,757 COVID-19 tests had been performed in Saskatchewan. Below is a graph showing how the cumulative number of tests has shot up in just a short while.  
  A manufacturer of medical ventilators says Canada should have stockpiled the machines after Toronto's 2003 SARS outbreak, given they are now harder to come by as hospitals around the world scramble to buy more with the outbreak of COVID-19. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines that help patients with damaged lungs get enough oxygen to live. Since COVID-19 can harm the lungs, the devices are critical to the survival of people hit hard by the virus.   There are now five presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, and the provincial government has ordered 140 ventilators to boost the province's supply of about 240. But Eric Gjerde, CEO of Airon Corporation, a U.S. company that manufactures ventilators for sale in Canada and abroad, said those machines should have already been on hand. \"Your government and Ministry of Health should have hundreds of ventilators in storage,\" he said in an email.   \"These ventilators can sit in boxes for years, with no maintenance. When they are needed, you just attach oxygen and you are good. It is just frustrating that governments can't think ahead and be prepared!\" SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was caused by a coronavirus that spread through much of the world in the early 2000s, killing hundreds of people including 44 in Canada. Nova Scotia has ordered 140 ventilators as it prepares for an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. (Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP via Getty Images) It could be hard for companies to meet demand for ventilators as the need skyrockets worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. It typically takes three to four weeks to fill an order, according to Canadian supplier McArthur Medical Sales. But during the pandemic it is \"very difficult\" to estimate when machines will be available, said Frank Fiorenza, a product development manager at McArthur and a respiratory therapist at the Ottawa Hospital. Some European countries struggling with coronavirus, like Italy and Germany, are clamouring for more ventilators to treat severe cases of the illness. Italy, which as of Sunday had more 1,800 deaths due to coronavirus, recently issued a tender for an additional 5,000 ventilators. Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said ventilators are expensive and over time they become outdated and can't be used.    \"Just creating a big stockpile of ventilators thinking that whatever time in the future you might have them may not be the wisest thing,\ " he said Monday.     He said 11 years ago during H1N1 pandemic the province did increase the number of ventilators. Under normal circumstances those old machines would no longer be used, he said, but during the current outbreak they might be put into service in some fashion. Fiorenza said other provinces have similar caches of old machines. In Ontario, he said 16 hospitals have at least 216 ventilators that act as a pandemic reserve. However, he said health authorities need to make sure they have enough respiratory therapists to run them. \"If nobody knows how to use them, if nobody knows how to run them  it's irrelevant. You're not going to be really saving lives if people are on machines and the operator doesn't know how to work it,\" said Fiorenza, who is in self-isolation at his home in Ottawa after returning from a family vacation in Jamaica.    Supply chain problem Right now, Airon has received large orders from U.S. emergency organizations, which has eaten up its production capacity for the next several months. As such, the company has stopped all international shipments, including those to Canada. It can make 20 ventilators a week.   \"The main problem is the supply chain. We do just-in-time manufacturing and have very lean component supplies in stock. That's the hard part, getting our custom parts made and delivered in an emergency,\ " said Gjerde. World Health Organization warned last week of global shortages and price gouging on ventilators and personal protective equipment, and urged companies and governments to increase production by 40 per cent. A survey in 2009 showed there were almost 5,000 mechanical ventilators spread out in 286 hospitals across Canada.   MORE TOP STORIES
  How COVID-19 progresses from incubation to recovery has implications for everything from how long people may spread it before showing symptoms, to how long people can be expected to occupy resources such as ICU beds and ventilators in hospitals.   Here's a closer look at what has been learned about how symptoms develop from international studies and interviews with front-line doctors. Note that the averages represent typical cases, and there tends to be a wide range at all stages of the disease.   Incubation period The period in which a person is infected but shows no symptoms appears to average around five to six days, although it can vary from one to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization and Chinese data. Because people without symptoms aren't usually tested, positive tests typically represent infections that happened on average five days and up to two weeks earlier. Studies also suggest people with no symptoms or mild symptoms are responsible for most of the spread. Mild to moderate symptoms Even those who go on to experience more severe symptoms typically begin with mild symptoms, most often fever and a dry cough, although they can also include more unusual symptoms such as loss of taste and smell. Symptoms will remain mild in about 80 per cent of cases, the WHO says, and recovery takes about two weeks in mild cases. Typically, the cough lasts a week longer than the fever, a Chinese study found. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are told to recover at home. A key, more severe symptom that sometimes leads to hospitalization is shortness of breath or dyspnea, which shows up on average five to six days after symptoms began, Chinese researchers reported in medical journals JAMA and The Lancet. For more details, read these personal accounts of what it's like to have a milder case of COVID-19 from Kym Murphy of Saint John, N.B., David Anzarouth of Toronto and Todd Rowan of Saskatoon.   (CBC News) Hospitalization Studies in China and the U.S suggest that most patients who are hospitalized are admitted, on average, about a week after symptoms begin. In Canada, patients appear to be sickest at about that time, said Dr. Bram Rochwerg, site lead at the Juravinski Hospital intensive care unit in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University. However, other studies show wide variations in when patients are hospitalized —  the average time from symptom onset varied from 1.5 days in one Chinese study to 11 days in another.   The rate at which people are hospitalized and admitted to ICU and how long they spend there can vary from country to country. It's not the number of COVID-19 patients posing a challenge for ICUs — it's how long they staySecond OpinionWhy COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think Rochwerg said that timing depends partly on criteria for hospitalization. Some hospitals in China admitted most patients who showed up, while many hospitals in the U.S. and Canada have been more restrictive, sending patients home unless their symptoms are severe. Two Chinese studies found that patients who are hospitalized in general wards typically stayed for an average of 10 or 12 days. Those who died in general wards tended to do so in about the same amount of time, the same studies found. WATCH | COVID-19 patient 'would beg' Canadians to listen to top doctors: B.C. resident Erin Leigh, 38, is recovering from the novel coronavirus in hospital. She told CBC News she had never experienced an illness like COVID-19. 7:00 ICU admission and stay A key symptom that often leads to ICU admission is acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. That is lung inflammation and fluid build-up in the lungs that stops air from getting in and causes blood oxygen levels to drop. Acute respiratory distress syndrome typically requires life support such as mechanical ventilation that must be administered in the ICU. The onset of ARDS has been reported to average eight or 11 days after symptoms begin (about one to three days after hospital admission) in Chinese studies in JAMA and The Lancet.  ICU admission typically follows within two days. Rochwerg said at his hospital in Hamilton it's not unusual for patients with ARDS to be admitted straight from the emergency room into the ICU. ARDS is part of an exaggerated immune response called a \"cytokine storm,\" that can also lead to complications such as acute kidney damage.   This chart, based on a study of hospitalized patients in China, shows the progression of symptoms and major interventions over the course of the disease for those who survived the illness and those who did not. (Fei Zhou/The Lancet/Elsevier) Very sick patients died on average four or five days after being admitted to ICU, Chinese studies found. In Italy, patients averaged seven days in the ICU before death. Those who eventually recovered spent longer in the ICU, averaging eight, nine and 14 days in studies from China, Italy and the U.S. respectively.  There's a wide variation. Dr. Rob Fowler, chief of Sunnybrook Hospital's trauma and critical-care program in Toronto, told CBC News earlier in April that dozens of COVID-19 patients have come through his ICU and required care lasting for \"many, many days to many, many weeks.\" UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear themCBC InvestigatesSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 Ontario ICU beds Rochwerg noted that while the virus is the trigger, it's actually the body's own response that generates severe complications, such as ARDS. \"That's the reason they stay critically ill for five days, a week, two weeks,\ " he said. That's much longer than the three days spent in ICU by average critically ill patients without COVID-19. This is why experts say COVID-19 patients tend to accumulate in ICUs and the pandemic poses such a challenge for health systems. Paramedics transfer a patient from an ambulance into the LaSalle Hospital in Montreal on April 25, as COVID-19 cases rise in Canada and around the world.   (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press) Post-ICU recovery Most studies didn't describe how long patients spent recovering in hospital after leaving the ICU. However, Dr. Kenneth Lyn-Kew, an associate professor of pulmonology and critical care medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver, told Scientific American that it can take two days to two weeks. CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? Rochwerg said patients typically discharged from the ICU spend at least as much time as they spent in the ICU recovering in general hospital wards, if not more. \"But everyone is different.\ "  Some, he said, may even require extensive rehab or long-term care afterward. 
  The death toll in New York, the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, was \"effectively flat\" for the second day in a row, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in his daily news conference on Monday. The overall death toll climbed by 599 to 4,758, while Cuomo expressed cautious optimism in the daily increase of new hospitalizations (358) and new admissions into intensive care (128). Cuomo said there were some signs that the spread of the virus in New York has slowed, but cautioned: \"It could still go any way.\ " The current strain on the state's blend of public and private hospitals in New York City, he said, was \"unsustainable at this rate.\" Not long after Cuomo spoke, the United States as a whole had reached a death toll of more than 10,000, according to the coronavirus resource centre at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. The U.S. has seen 10,335 die from COVID-19 causes, according to the tally, with national confirmed cases at more than 347,000. It represents unwelcome exponential growth in mortality, with the U.S. having surpassed 1,000 deaths on March 26, 11 days ago. ' Peak death week,' admiral predicts The Trump administration itself is girding for a tough week in the coronavirus battle, with hopes that the physical distancing measures and stay-at-home orders seen around the country will help the number of cases and fatalities level off next week. \"It's going to be the peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week,\ " Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and member of the White House coronavirus task force, told ABC's Good Morning America on Monday. Giroir raised particular alarm for the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the city of Detroit. A nurse walks outside of Wyckoff Hospital in Brooklyn on April 6. On Monday, New York Gov.

Smith/AFP/Getty Images) A report from the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released Monday indicates three of four U.S. hospitals surveyed are already treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The report also says that hospitals expect to be overwhelmed as cases rocket toward their projected peak. The report warns that different, widely reported problems are feeding off each other in a vicious cycle. Such problems include insufficient tests, slow results, scarcity of protective gear, the shortage of breathing machines for seriously ill patients and burned-out staffs anxious for their own safety. \"There's this sort of domino effect,\" said Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general at the DHHS. \"These challenges play off each other and exacerbate the situation. There's a cascade effect.\" Mobile users: View the document (PDF KB) (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content Last week, President Trump attempted to reduce that shortage by limiting the amount of equipment that would leave the country.  Using his authority under the 1950 Defence Production Act, he announced the U.S. would stop exporting N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting health-care workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, outraged many officials in Canada. Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus But on Monday evening, 3M released a statement saying it had struck a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to supply N95 masks to other countries, including Canada.   \"As the pandemic unfolds in different stages around the world,\" the company said in a statement, \"3M will continue to work with governments to direct respirators and other supplies to serve areas most in need.\" U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters following a meeting of his coronavirus task force at the White House on April 6. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In dealing with shortages, many hospitals are responding by improvising their own solutions. Some explored buying face masks from nail salons due to the shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE. Others have been trying to make their own hand sanitizer by blending ultrasound gel with alcohol from local distilleries. Overtime hours and increased use of supplies are raising costs at the same time that many hospitals experience a revenue crunch because elective surgeries have been cancelled. WATCH | Disputes over masks , equipment emerge: Provincial and municipal leaders are criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for attempting to halt exports of N95 masks to Canada. 4:52 Rural hospitals could be particularly vulnerable in the event of a significant caseload because of a limited number of beds and smaller staffs. The head of a group representing for-profit hospitals said Monday that, on top of the problems in the report, facilities are finding that COVID-19 patients take long to recover. \"We are finding that their lengths of stay are much longer than comparable illnesses like pneumonia and flu, and they are requiring a lot of drugs,\" said Chip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals. How to set priorities for the use of ventilators, breathing machines that can sustain life, is one of the most worrisome questions. Hospitals from Louisiana to New York and Michigan are already confronting projected shortages, the AP reported last week. \"Government needs to provide guidelines on ethics if health resources are limited and decisions need to be made about which patients to treat,\" a hospital official in Broward County, Fla., told the inspector general's office. \"Are physicians liable for their decisions if that happens?\" Nurses at Harlem Hospital hold a rally demanding greater access to PPE to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in front of the hospital in Manhattan on Monday.    (Aleksandra Michalska/Reuters) More than 90 per cent of U.S. residents are under some kind of stay-at-home order. The exceptions are eight states, all with governors from Trump's Republican Party: Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Georgia, which has recorded 6,600 cases and more than 200 deaths, ordered residents to stay home but then allowed some beaches to reopen. In Washington, D.C., and other places, some people flouted the physical distancing guidelines over the weekend. Sunshine and warm weather brought hordes of people out to bike trails and open spaces near the Potomac River. While a number of people wore masks, some groups moved together in close proximity. 
  Canada's hospitals and health officials are looking at ways to boost the number of available ventilators to prepare for a deluge of very sick COVID-19 patients amid projections that they could run out of such life-saving equipment within weeks. While most people who get COVID-19 only face mild symptoms, the sickest end up in intensive care units and must be attached to ventilators in order to survive and recover. A new study shows Canada's most populated province, Ontario, could run out of ventilators quickly if the trajectory of the pandemic is similar to that in Italy. There, the coronavirus epidemic has already overwhelmed the health-care system, forcing doctors to make hard choices about which patients get access to life-saving resources such as intensive care beds and ventilators. Ontario has implemented school and restaurant closures and is encouraging social distancing among residents in an effort to stop that from happening, notes Beate Sander, a scientist who has been modelling the potential impact of the pandemic on the province's health-care system. \"What our modelling is showing is that if we cannot keep these interventions in place ...  we're going to run out of capacity really, really quickly — likely in the next two weeks, Sander said.   Sander is a University Health Network Scientist and an associate professor at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. She and her colleagues looked at a variety scenarios that estimated when the hospital system would run out of resources without an increase in ventilators and ICU beds. The study was published online by the researchers Thursday, but has not yet been peer-reviewed. It found that even under a \"conservative\" scenario where cases increase only 7.5 per cent per day, ventilators would run out after a month. That's because very sick patients tend to spend one to three weeks in hospital, Sander said.  \"They're piling up.\" COVID-19: What you need to knowVentilator manufacturer says Canada should have stockpiled machines after SARS In total, Ontario has 2,000 ICU beds and 1,300 ventilators, but most are in use. Sander suggests 25 per cent be freed up for COVID-19 patients by cancelling elective surgeries and discharging patients. She said her main concern now is that Ontario keep up its social distancing measures and that \"we absolutely do the planning and ramp up our capacity of ventilators and ICU beds. It has to happen.\" Creative solutions to acquire more ventilator capacity Meanwhile, hospitals are looking at creative solutions. Dr. Alain Gauthier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital, has rigged up ventilators to be able to ventilate two patients at once instead of one. He did that by following YouTube videos created by two Detroit doctors in 2006. \"At one point we may not have other options,\ " Dr. Gauthier told CBC News. \"The option could be well , we let people die or we give that a chance.\" Watch: Does Canada have enough ventilators? Fearing a potential shortage of ventilators, one rural Canadian doctor has rigged up a fix. 2:04 The hospital currently has four new ventilators and four in reserve that can't be repaired.   Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said Thursday that the federal government hasn't received any requests for ventilators from provincial health authorities, but has been acquiring some for its stockpile. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said Canada could do what the U.S. and Italy are doing: getting military forces to help with the production of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Ontario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half : study Ontario's health minister, Christine Elliott, has assured the public there are enough ventilators for now — and 300 more have been ordered. \"We've procured 300 more ventilators to add to the 210 we currently have in surplus,\" said Elliott's spokesperson, Hayley Chazan. \"We continue to work on procuring additional ventilators.\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Canadian automotive supplier and manufacturer Magna International has also committed to help with the production of ventilators. \"We can't rely on importing these ventilators,\ " he was quoted by Reuters as saying. Perth doctor rigs up solution to feared ventilator shortageGovernment expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister One U.S. company that manufacturers ventilators told CBC News earlier this week that it has stopped all international shipments, including those to Canada, due to large orders from U.S. emergency organizations. Supply is also being squeezed by large orders in Europe. Germany has ordered 10,000 new ventilators and Italy has ordered 5,000, NBC News reported. 
  Health officials in Halton Region say Ontario's second coronavirus-linked death, a Milton man in his 50s, is a case of community transmission.   \"At this time what we know is that the individual did not travel outside of Canada recently nor was he a contact of a known case of COVID-19,\"  Dr Hamidah Meghani, Halton's medical officer of health, said at a news conference on Thursday.   Ontario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half: study An additional 44 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Ontario on Thursday, bringing the provincial total to 258 including two deaths and five resolved cases. Of those confirmed cases, 22 are currently hospitalized.  The province remains under a state of emergency. Meghani said the man had an underlying health condition, and that he had initially been treated at Milton District Hospital, but was transferred yesterday to Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital where he died the same day. \"We need to act now , this is the tragic proof that we need to work together to slow down the spread of COVID-19, not only as individuals but as a community, we need to take this seriously,\ " Meghani said.   \"Gatherings and parties can wait, play dates can wait, some of your errands can also wait, allow your life to pause. Focus on what is important.\" Health Minister Christine Elliott said the province's coroner will investigate to confirm whether or not coronavirus was the main cause of the man's death. Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, confirmed Thursday the death was COVID-19-related. She said so far they have not identified a connection to the case with travel, but cautioned that they are not finished with the investigation.   \"It'll take a few days and they may or may not be able to determine where he got it,\ " Yaffe said.   Most cases come after travelling internationally Of the confirmed cases in Ontario, 80 per cent of the patients have travelled outside of Canada. Of those cases, 28 per cent returned from the U.S. and 26 per cent travelled in Europe, Yaffe said.   The most common U.S. states infected patients have travelled from are New York, Colorado, California, Nevada and Massachusetts.   Fifteen per cent of all cases in Ontario come from close contact with an infected individual. Cases in the province are expected to rise as thousands of Canadians continue to return home from abroad, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical health officer. \"The 45 [new cases] today seems surprisingly low with the flow coming in, but I won't be surprised if it goes up,\ " Williams said.    Hospitals see same screening as long-term care homes   Hospitals in the province are now rigorously screening visitors in the same way long-term care homes have been. Anyone who has travelled in the last 14 days or has come into contact with someone who has will be turned away. \"If you're ill you should not be visiting,\ " Williams said.   However, if someone is there to see a loved one they may be able to negotiate with the facility on a case-by-case basis. They may be asked to take special precautions, like wearing protective clothing and masks.   Concerns over waits for test results The number of cases under investigation in the province stands at 3,972. Health professionals told CBC Toronto on Wednesday that the wait period for test results in the province is currently between five and seven days.   This means the new infection numbers being reported each day actually represent the spread of the virus several days ago, raising questions about the actual current rate of transmission.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and the world March 19COVID-19 pandemic: What's happening in the GTA today One of the new Ontario patients, a man in his 80s in Durham Region, is hospitalized. But information on whether people are self-isolating or hospitalized, their ages and regions, as well as how they were infected, is listed as \"pending\" for more than half the new cases. Updated numbers are expected from Ontario Public Health again at 5:30 p.m.   Meanwhile, Elliott announced that following technical difficulties with the Telehealth Ontario line, the province has added an additional 1,300 lines. There are now more than 2,000 lines available at the service. Emergency bill passes unanimously The provincial legislature passed emergency legislation Thursday aimed at protecting workers who are forced to stay home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Premier Doug Ford promised the bill earlier this week and said it applies to employees under investigation, supervision or treatment for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Workers in isolation or in quarantine and those who need to provide care to a person for a reason related to COVID-19, including for a school or daycare closure, will also be protected by the bill. And employees are now exempt from needing to show a doctor's note to get time off. The measure is retroactive to Jan. 25, 2020  — the date the first presumptive case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the province.   At the news conference with Elliott, Ford said that other measures the province is taking include:  Grocery stores and pharmacies will be allowed to receive deliveries 24/7, regardless of municipal noise regulations. Temporary suspension of requirement to renew driver's licences, licence plate stickers and health cards. Ontarians can use expired documents for the time being.   Ford also said he has been in talks with auto manufacturers in Ontario, so that companies may be prepared to switch over their line capacity to produce ventilators should the health-care system run out. According to Elliott, the province currently has 500 ventilators at the ready in addition to those already in hospitals. Premier Doug Ford says the province is not planning to limit the number of people allowed in retail stores at one time for fear that creating lineups outside could contribute to the spread of COVID-19. 0:56 Only 24 MPPs voted In the name of social distancing, there were only 24 members in the house to pass the emergency legislation: 12 governing PCs, eight New Democrats, two Liberals, one Green and the Speaker. They were allowed to sit anywhere but had to ensure there was enough space between them for social distancing. Government house leader Paul Calandra acknowledged the unusual nature of the one-day sitting, but conceded there could be more like it on the horizon as the Progressive Conservative government responds to the evolving situation. \"Like everybody else, I hope that this is resolved very quickly,\ " he said. \"But until the medical officer of health tells us otherwise, this could be the new norm for the Ontario legislature for the foreseeable future.\" He said the government has taken the unusual step of giving the opposition in-depth briefings and taken some suggestions to amend the legislation. Calandra said the government will also introduce and expects to pass a second bill to enable municipal councils to meet by teleconference during the pandemic. Prominent scientist dares to ask: Has the COVID-19 response gone too far?Here's what you need to know about the COVID-19 scams popping up in Canada NDP Leader Andrea Horwath's party supported the expedited passage of the bill but is disappointed it does not contain more protections for workers. \"Ultimately, the measures being agreed to can only be seen as a small first step,\ " she said in a statement. Green party Leader Mike Schreiner also supported the bill. \"In times like this, politicians must put partisanship aside to unlock support and assistance for people,\ " he said. Restaurants, theatres and community centres are on the list of businesses and public spaces ordered to close as part of emergency measures in Ontario aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. An additional 44 cases were confirmed in Ontario on Thursday, bringing the provincial total to 258, including two deaths and five resolved cases. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Emergency funds coming in 2-3 weeks, Ottawa says Canadians worried about having enough money to pay for food, rent and medication can expect emergency funds in two to three weeks, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said today. In an interview with CBC News Network, Morneau said the government understands the urgency of the situation linked to the novel coronavirus and is leveraging the existing social service system to get money out the door. The government has waived the one-week wait for employment insurance and announced a series of new measures Wednesday to help Canadians and businesses taking a financial hit from the pandemic. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at his daily news conference from Ottawa that he expects new restrictions on non-essential travel at the Canada-U.S. border to take effect Friday night, but cautioned that both sides are still fine-tuning the agreement. Both countries have insisted that trade and key supplies will continue to flow across the border and people who need to cross for essential work will still be able to do so. Canadian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to get home, although the government says travellers presenting symptoms won't be able to board flights. Social distancing could be in place for weeks, months: PM Trudeau also said the unprecedented measures in place now — such as travel restrictions, social distancing protocols and business closures — could continue for some time as political leaders follow the advice of medical experts. \"We've heard anything from weeks to months,\ " he said. \"We know this is a difficult and extraordinary time in which Canadians are taking difficult and extraordinary measures, and we will continue to do that until Canadians are safe.\" Premier Doug Ford is asking Ontarians returning from abroad to follow self-isolation procedures, saying the province does not have the resources to enforce public health guidance. 0:59 TTC reports 1st COVID-19 case in employee The Toronto Transit Commission, which operates the city's public transit network, reported this morning that one of its workers has tested positive for COVID-19. According to TTC CEO Rick Leary, the employee works at the agency's Duncan Shop, where buses are repaired and overhauled. The employee went to work on March 11 after returning from travel and was sent home sick. They have not returned to work since, Leary said in a statement. \"Out of an abundance of caution, we have asked all impacted shop employees to self-isolate until March 25, and return to work on March 26 if they have no symptoms,\ " Leary said. The order affects between 130 and 170 people.   Provincial parks close The Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks says it decided to shutter the parks until April 30 to protect the health of employees and visitors. Andrew Buttigieg, a spokesman for the parks minister, says staff will post signs at park entrances to notify people about the closures. He says where possible, park entrances will be gated and buildings locked. Buttigieg says ministry staff will get in touch people who are in the backcountry or at campgrounds to tell them about the closure. They're being asked to leave by Thursday. Why some Canadians abroad aren't rushing home, despite Trudeau's plea The closure includes all aspects of the parks, including day-use, car camping and backcountry camping. \"We understand that spending time in nature is important for the health and well-being of Ontarians,\ " Buttigieg said in a written statement on Wednesday. \"However, in order to assist the province to further efforts in keeping employees and Ontarians safe during this time, the ministry made the decision to close provincial parks to the public.\" The ministry said campground reservations up to April 30 will be cancelled automatically and a refund will be issued without the typical penalty fine. Tourism industry hit hard Ontario's tourism industry says it is already feeling significant impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak. A recent survey commissioned by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO) found some accommodation businesses already reporting a threat of massive layoffs and bankruptcy. Hotel reservations have seen an 80 per cent drop while travel operators reported mass cancellations of bookings, the survey found. \"We're hopeful that there will be immediate significant economic support to both small and large operators,\" said Beth Potter, President and CEO of TIAO. \"The announcements from government are encouraging but we need the detail behind the support packages and the implementation plans urgently.\" The data for the study was collected between March 12-March 16. 
  Ottawa ramped up its response to the COVID-19 pandemic on Monday with sweeping new travel restrictions meant to prevent the spread of the disease — but stopped short of banning travellers from the U.S. That creates a loophole that risks further spread of the disease, according to critics.   \"We remain concerned that access from visitors from the U.S. continues to be allowed,\" said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix, citing the situation in neighbouring Washington State, where there are more confirmed cases of COVID-19 than in all of Canada, and 10 times as many deaths. \"I support all the measures the prime minister has taken and I'd like him to take one more — which is to also apply it to the United States, to visitors and non-essential travel.\" Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May also called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ban U.S. citizens. \"The situation in America is likely to be far worse than here, and the sooner we protect ourselves the better,\" said May.   Trudeau's announcement barred all foreign nationals from boarding flights to Canada, except for permanent residents, immediate family of Canadian citizens, U.S. citizens, air crew and diplomats. \"The level of integration of our two countries is quite particular,\ " Trudeau said, \"which is why we need to do some more work in order to ensure that we're doing what we need to do in the right way.\ " In 2019, 25 million travellers entered Canada from the U.S., according to Statistics Canada. The majority — 16.7 million — did so by car. Another 5.6 million arrived by plane. Total trade with the U.S. was valued at over $752 billion. Preserving that freedom of movement is necessary to maintain trade says Dennis Darby, president of the industry association Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. \"This is essential for continued access to critical supply chain components including for food processing and medical device production,\ " Darby said in a statement.   Vehicles enter the U.S. at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in Detroit, on Monday. In 2019, 25 million travellers entered Canada from the U.S., according to Statistics Canada. (Paul Sancya/The Associated Press) In addition, Canada imports 75 per cent of its medical equipment, including X-ray machines and ventilators.  Around half of those imports come from the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. \"Whether it's the truckers going back and forth, whether it's people going back and forth between the plants …  it makes sense [that] we need to be able to have people go back and forth from Canada and the U.S.,\ " Darby told CBC News. But Trudeau's cabinet was also likely thinking about how Washington would react to a blanket ban on its citizens, said James Moore, a former cabinet minister under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. \"It's one thing to have a travel ban, but it's another thing for the president of the United States to see that as a vote of non-confidence on the global stage of his handling of the coronavirus,\" said Moore. \"The message that Canada would be sending to the world is that you can't trust the United States.\" Such a move would risk provoking a reaction from President Donald Trump that could damage the Canadian economy and lead to shortages, especially if the president decided to restrict trade in essential goods, Moore said.   Canada to bar entry to travellers who are not citizens, permanent residents or AmericansOttawa can make quarantines mandatory — here's why it likely won't \"Donald Trump has shown an ability to — without any rationality — put in place barriers to trade and access to the U.S. market for political reasons,\ " he said. Moore cited Trump's steel tariffs on Canadian steel  as an example of the kind of economic pain the U.S. could impose on Canada.   \"An absolute public panic could set in if we go into grocery stores and the shelves are not being restocked and people aren't getting their medicines,\ " he said.  
  Saskatchewan reported 14 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, bringing its total to 220. Forty-eight people have recovered from the virus in the province, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. An assisted-living care centre worker in Regina has tested positive for the virus. A long list of professionals has petitioned the province to release inmates in light of the pandemic.   Saskatchewan's privacy commissioner says \"more information is better'\" during a health crisis like COVID-19.    The Saskatchewan Health Authority has offered an early glimpse at some of the factors health care teams might weigh to decide which COVID-19 patients get ventilators if there are not enough to go around. Dr. Susan Shaw, the SHA's chief medical officer, said the details are still being finalized and, at the moment, remain hypothetical. \"We're not there right now,\ " Shaw said in an interview Thursday.   While it's not clear, cumulatively, how many of Saskatchewan's COVID-19 cases have needed a ventilator, the maximum number of coronavirus cases who have been under intensive care (ICU) at the same time is known to be two.   As of Thursday, four COVID-19 patients were in hospital in the province, including two people in ICU.   Shaw's colleague Dr. Saqib Shahab — Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer and the public face of the province's fight to \"flatten the curve\ " — said it's hard to know when the province might reach its infection peak.    \"Obviously at some point we want to see the curve going down. Is that going to be in four weeks, eight weeks? We really can't predict,\ " he said on Wednesday.     COVID-19 in Sask. : No telling yet when province will reach infection peak, premier says   The province currently has 450 ventilators and has ordered hundreds more. One early-draft planning doc, leaked last week, estimated that at peak infection time, Saskatoon alone might need 500 to 600 ventilators at a time.   Health officials in Saskatchewan and elsewhere have undertaken the grim but necessary exercise of contemplating who would get a ventilator should hospitals be swarmed with serious cases while not having enough machines to go around. \"One of the main purposes of actually having this work done in preparation is a part of our responsibility to avoid arbitrary decisions,\" Shaw said. \"Right now the decisions are made about what's best for the individual. And when you get into a situation where you're starting to actually face scarcity, the ethical principles shift to be what's best for society.\ " Dr. Susan Shaw is the chief medical officer for the Saskatchewan Health Authority. (CBC News) Age is not the only factor Decisions about which patients would get ventilators would be made by doctors and members of the health authority's ethics commities, Shaw said. The age of patients is a key consideration, but not the only one, she said.   \"It's actually one of a combination of criteria,\ " she said. \"To make decisions solely on age would be discriminatory and would not be the way we would want to approach this. It's age in combination with frailty, chronic disease and recoverability.\ " In the \"extremely unlikely\" scenario where two patients' criteria lined up exactly, the ventilator would go to the younger patient, Shaw said.   \"That's based on the principle called the goal of the life cycle, which is every individual needs to have the equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life.\"   At the Top of the Covid-19 Curve , How Do Hospitals Decide Who Gets Treatment?    What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?    No one would completely stop being cared for, however. \"That always applies no matter what the situation is,\ " Shaw said. \"This means making sure that we never abandon the patient.\" Medical health professionals elsewhere have also contemplated the notion of a lottery.   While Shaw stressed that that option is not in Saskatchewan's current way of thinking, she is familiar with the concept. \"My understanding is that if you ever got into a tiebreaker situation where absolutely everything [including age] was identical — and again I think this is absolutely hypothetical — then a lottery is one of the ways that you could tackle that.\" New numbers,  Regina worker tests positive Friday's daily update from health officials included 14 new cases, bringing the total provincial tally to 220. Shahab said the comparatively low daily case additions in Saskatchewan — which have averaged 14 per day, after the province saw its largest day-over-day increase of 30 on March 27 — \"are to some extent reassuring.\" \"However, we are seeing that less and less of those are due to travel,\" he said. Of the total 220 cases, 102 are recent travellers, 52 tested positive because of exposure to someone they live with or after they attended an event, 10 have no known exposures and 56 are still investigation. The province added yet more detail to its daily report, for the first time specifying what region each fatal victim of the virus came from.   Sask. should 'lower privacy bar to serve greater good,' says health analyst   Shahab was asked about specifying which community an infected person came from (beyond Saskatoon and Regina). \"As our numbers increase that becomes easier to do,\" he said.   Here's how the cases break down regionally.   (Duk Han Lee) The province said a worker at Eden Care, an assisted living facility in Regina, has tested positive for the virus. The person was identified by another positive test case, through the process known as contact tracing.   \"There are no indications it has spread to other employees or residents,\" the health ministry said in a release. \"The facility is closed to admissions, discharges and transfers, and residents who have been in close contact with the employee will be isolated and monitored twice-daily for 14 days.\" Effective Friday , all people working in long-term care facilities in Saskatchewan will have their temperatures checked and will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms before beginning their shifts. On a promising note, 48 out of 220 people have recovered from the virus, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. Pandemic planning updates coming next week Premier Scott Moe said Thursday that he had asked the health authority to publicly release updated projections of how many people in the province might become infected and die from the virus, under various scenarios.     COVID-19 in Sask: Internal draft gov't document outlines 'worst case scenario' of up to 15,000 deaths    That update — which will also touch on planning for field hospitals and COVID-19 care in existing hospitals — is expected early next week. \"They all do fit together,\ " Shaw said of the modelling, the operational plan and the ethical framework for decision-making.   \"We want to share it,\ " she said of the ethical framework. \"It's not quite ready to be shared but it is ready to start being talked about.\" 'None of this can be rushed'   A front-line aspect of Saskatchewan's pandemic planning has come to light thanks to a Facebook post on Thursday. A health care worker shared photos of herself and colleagues at Royal University Hospital clothed in face shields, gloves and full-body suits. They were practicing intubation on \"Harold.\ "   \"Harold is a simulation dummy for the newly formed intubation teams to practice on,\ " the worker wrote. \"We are teams of anaesthesiologists, AAs and nurses who practice and train day or night every shift until there is a real patient with COVID-19 who cannot breathe on their own. \"I am grateful that we have this time to get prepared,\" the worker added.   Health providers at Royal University Hospital have practiced intubating on a COVID-19 patient using this dummy, named 'Harold.' (Facebook) Shaw confirmed this type of COVID-19-specific training has gone on for at least two weeks. \"Putting a breathing tube in somebody is a very routine activity for an anesthesiologist and many other health care professionals,\ " Shaw said. \"But how do you do it [properly] while appropriately donning and doffing equipment?\ "   Shaw even joined in the exercise later on Thursday.   Spent my evening at RUH ICU with <a href=\"https://twitter.com /SaskHealth?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@SaskHealth</a > anesthesia airway team practicing scenarios to safely care for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19SK?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19SK</a> patients<br><br > Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands&mdash;@drsusanshaw \"Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands,\ " Shaw wrote on Twitter. ' Staff safety is the number one priority' The health care worker who posted on Facebook said putting on and taking off equipment takes a long time, but with good reason. \"So that we health care people can be as safe as we can,\ " she wrote. \"None of this can be rushed as staff safety is the number one priority.\ " During Thursday's provincial COVID-19 news conference, Moe said the procurement of more personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers was his top priority on a call that same afternoon with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other premiers. The health worker wrote in their Facebook post that the trainees weren't wearing N95 masks in order to \"save them for when they are actually needed.\ " At the same provincial news conference, Shahab cited instances where it was not initially known a patient had respiratory symptoms and so health care workers were not wearing the right PPE. Shahab said patients should always phone a clinic instead of just going there.     COVID-19 in Sask : 6 more health care workers infected with virus, top doc says   The health care worker training for COVID-19 intubation had some advice too. \"You definitely don't want to become a Harold. Stay home, and stay safe.\ "
  Premier Jason Kenney announced Saturday the province would be sending personal protective equipment or PPE to other provinces battling COVID-19. Kenney made the announcement from an Alberta Health Services (AHS) warehouse while espousing the province's readiness for the pandemic. \"Our numbers are far lower than the hardest hit areas of Europe, the United States and significantly lower than we've seen in provinces like Quebec and Ontario,\" he said.   Kenney said Alberta is so far outperforming the probable scenario of models released earlier this week, which predicted as many as 800,000 infections. \"We are at about one quarter of the modelled levels under the probable scenario for today, and that is very good news,\ " he said, adding it was not reason to halt collective efforts to stop the spread.   Seven new COVID-19 deaths in Alberta, highest daily number so far What you need to know about COVID-19 in Alberta on Saturday, April 11   Kenney said the numbers supported the belief that Alberta would have beds and medical equipment beyond its need. According to the news release, Ontario will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2.5 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves. 87,000 goggles. 50 ventilators.   Quebec will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves.   British Columbia is set to receive 250,000 N95 masks. The premier also gave an update on COVID-19 cases in the province, adding 69 confirmed cases to bring the provincial total to 1,569. There are 216 cases suspected of being acquired in the community.   He also reported an additional death from the McKenzie Towne continuing care facility in Calgary, bringing the total number of deaths at the facility to 18. WATCH | How Alberta stockpiled medical equipment before COVID-19 struck: Alberta Health Services started ordering personal protective equipment (PPE) as coronavirus was taking hold in China and is now able to help other provinces in need of gloves, masks and ventilators.   1:46 This brings the total numbers of deaths in the province to 40. In the Calgary zone, 28 died from COVID-19, seven in the Edmonton zone, four in the North zone, and one person has died in the Central zone. Forty-seven Albertans were hospitalized — one fewer than on Friday — and 13 in intensive care units. A total of 774 people have recovered, according to the premier. The province is also making it a requirement for continuing care workers to wear masks at all times when providing direct patient care or working in patient-care areas, starting next week. ' The right thing to do' Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Alberta's modelling indicates the health-care system can handle the peak of the disease. By the end of April, Shandro said, AHS would have 2,250 acute care beds, almost 1,100 ICU beds, and 760 ventilators — more than double the current count. He said the province had recently signed contracts valued at more than $200 million, including for millions of gowns and N95 masks. Shandro said the province is in a position to ensure Albertans' health as well as support other Canadian health-care systems. \"This is the right thing to do,\" he said at the press conference. \"I assure all Albertans that we will have ample supply.\ " The province says the equipment will begin shipping next week. 
  Health officials in Ottawa have been ramping up their efforts to track and contain potential cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, as the disease spreads. There have still been no positive cases of coronavirus reported in Ottawa.   Even so, officials with Ottawa Public Health (OPH) and the Ottawa Hospital have been on alert since January, preparing for the first positive case in the capital and what should happen if the number of cases grow. ' Just a matter of time' before coronavirus comes to Ottawa, top doctor saysSome supplies running low as coronavirus fears grow OPH says it's preparing to set up special assessment centres using community paramedics as a way of diverting people with questions about coronavirus from hospitals, as those facilities are likely to face increased demand during an outbreak. \"The emergency departments are busy. It's not the best place to send people who are well. There are sick people there,\" said Dr. Vera Etches, medical officer of health for the city. Darryl Wilton, president of the Ontario Paramedic Association, said paramedics are in an excellent position to treat people. \"What we don't want is a cluster of infected patients showing up in a place like a hospital and spreading it to everyone else in the waiting room,\ " Wilton said. Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said it's important people call public health before coming to the emergency room if they suspect they may have coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) The 'worried well' Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director for the department of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said many patients won't contract severe cases of the virus, which has symptoms similar to flu. Western Quebec couple who beat coronavirus back in Canada Willmore said the \"worried well\" have already started to appear in emergency rooms, but so far hospitals have been able to manage the increased demand. \"We really want to make sure that the folks who are feeling well enough to be at home have [somewhere] they can go other than the hospital, to save that for the patients that really need to be here,\ " he said. Dr. Kathryn Suh, associate director of the infection prevention and control program at the hospital, says staff are being equipped with yellow gowns, gloves, special respirators and plastic face shields. Patients with symptoms who have a reasonable connection to other coronavirus cases would be put into negative pressure isolation  — meaning a room that ventilates outdoors rather than circulating air back into the hallway — and a swab would be taken for testing, Suh said. Dr. Kathryn Suh explains how a tube on a ventilator would be used to treat a patient suffering from respiratory complications from coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) The hospital has 90 isolation rooms and will be moving patients around so that those with COVID-19 are contained.    \"We have some reserves for the first patient that comes that requires that isolation bed. We are keeping those areas available,\ " Willmore said.   \"Sometimes patients are in an isolation room because they're private rooms, but they don't require isolation.\ " Willmore said the Ottawa Hospital is well stocked with face masks and ventilators, and also has access to additional supplies through its partners. Both Willmore and Suh said people concerned about coronavirus should call OPH first. Public health calls increasing On Tuesday, public health nurses fielded several calls some from people concerned about whether they'd been exposed to coronavirus.  The number of calls have almost tripled from early to late Februrary — from 60 calls weekly to more than 160 — and continue to increase. Etches said in addition to monitoring for cases related to travel, OPH is starting to test people who present with respiratory illnesses to see if COVID-19 has entered the city undetected. Etches said public health nurses will retrace the steps of anybody who tests positive in an effort to contain the risk of exposure. Murielle Simplice, a public health nurse, says she's fielding more calls from Ottawa residents who are concerned about the spread of coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) \"We are doing intensive case and contact management. That's our plan,\ " Etches said. \"We account for every minute of their day to understand if they may have exposed anybody else.\ " Etches said a team of between 20 and 30 is currently monitoring the situation, but more staff can be brought in from OPH's 200 nurses, or total staff of 500, if volumes increase.   The plan for schools OPH also has a plan in place to stem outbreaks in schools. Etches said if a child showed up to school coughing and then tested positive, health officials would remove them from class before deciding if the whole school needed to be closed.     \"We would work with the school to make sure we understand where the child has been in the school, which classrooms could be affected,\" she said.   \"[We'd also be] making sure that we clean the environment and then providing the right information to the families who might have been affected.\ " Etches said any decision on shutting down a school or workplace or restricting public gatherings — as has happened in other countries with coronavirus outbreaks — would involve consulting her provincial and federal counterparts. 
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  An intensive care doctor in Toronto is pleading with political leaders to take bold steps now to impose a lockdown, warning that Ontario's health system could face \"total collapse\" if the spread of COVID-19 is not slowed.   Dr. Michael Warner is medical director of the intensive care unit (ICU) at Michael Garron Hospital and chairs the critical care section of the Ontario Medical Association.   \"It's World War Three,\ " Warner said in an interview with CBC News. \"This could be an unmitigated disaster. This is the time to overreact. If I'm wrong, that's great, but at least we're prepared. But if I'm not wrong, then we're in major trouble.\"   The number of new coronavirus cases in Ontario has grown by an average of 21 per cent daily over the past week. That means the total number of cases is doubling every four days, and if that rate of growth were to continue, Ontario's 2,053 ICU beds stand to run out by mid-to-late April.   \"We should expect a massive influx of COVID-19 patients into our hospitals, both ill and critically ill,\" said Warner.   \"We have to be prepared for the worst case scenario,\" he added.   \"This is the time to overreact to what potentially could happen, not to hope for the best.\ " Dr. Michael Warner is the medical director of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital and says Canada should have enforced a mandatory lockdown from coast to coast a while ago. 6:25 Warner is calling for \"social distancing without exception\" and urging political leaders and public health officials to impose stricter measures to slow the spread of the virus.   \"If we don't, the impact on the health care system could be total collapse,\ " he said, urging mandatory lockdowns to be put in place immediately.   How Ontario hospitals are preparing for a surge in COVID-19 casesOntario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half: study \"If we do it sooner the long term pain will be less,\" said Warner. \"I don't think it's too late to institute those rules, but time is running out.\"   In Italy, COVID-19 has overwhelmed the health system and has killed 5,000 people. New reports coming from New York, San Francisco and Seattle suggest hospitals have begun to see surges in patients.   \"We've learned from the experience in Italy that once it gets out of control the whole health care system is going to be under siege,\" said Warner. \"The patients who get sick with COVID-19 have very, very severe illness, not kind of a flu-light, but very, heavy severe ICU illness that requires sophisticated [medical] techniques.\"  Cancelling scheduled surgeries, as many Ontario hospitals are now doing, can help free some beds on regular wards but does little to relieve the pressure in the critical care wards, says Warner. Heart attacks, strokes, car crashes, overdoses and major infectious diseases that are not COVID-19 will continue to happen.     Warner takes little solace from the announcements from Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott that the province has obtained 300 more ventilators and from Premier Doug Ford that auto parts manufacturers are retooling to build more.   \"It's nice to hear that 300 new ventilators have been purchased,\" said Warner  Ontarians told to 'lock down' to prevent further community spread of COVID-19COVID-19: What's happening in Ontario on Saturday   \"It's like saying, 'We need 10,000 people to have heart surgery, we're going to make a bunch of operating rooms equipped with the heart-lung machines, but we're not going to have any more heart surgeons.'\ "   There are about 400 ICU doctors in Ontario and Warner points out that each one cannot work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   Equipment such as masks, gowns and gloves to protect hospital workers from the COVID-19 virus is in short supply. Warner says some Toronto-area hospitals \"will definitely run out of\" that material within weeks, based on the current inventory and the rate it's being used.   \"What happens if half the ICU doctors get sick or in quarantine?\" he asked. \"Who's going to take care of the patients? Let alone the nurses who actually do all the heavy lifting.\"  Pedestrians wear masks in Toronto as residents engage in social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Warner is calling on Critical Care Services Ontario, a Ministry of Health organization, to create rapid education programs — what he describes as \"a crash course in how to be an ICU doctor\" — for other specialist physicians, such as cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists.   \"We need to get ahead of this. We need to think about the next steps, field hospitals, using airports, stadiums as potential places to take care of patients.\" THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 21Second OpinionWhy mass COVID-19 testing is key to stopping spread   Warner says he's infuriated by unclear and inconsistent messaging about social distancing, leading to instances such as in Toronto on Friday where people formed lengthy lines buy a new video game. He believes the spread of the virus will not be slowed unless the average person heeds the right message.   \"The safest number to congregate in is one. Not 50, not 10 , it's one,\" said Warner. \"Until the government, public health officials and policymakers are consistent with that message then the public will remain confused.\ "  Foresees 'deluge of patients' unless things change If the rate of growth of new infections is not slowed, Warner predicts \"a deluge of patients coming to hospitals in Canada all at the same time. There's no system on earth that can handle that.\ "      He said he is trying to get his message out through as many media interviews as possible this weekend.   \"No amount of time or preparation could make us ready for what could be coming in the days or weeks ahead,\" said Warner.   \"I'm trying to scream as loud as I can about this before I go to work on Monday, because once I go to work on Monday, I may not come out for four months.\" 
  Alberta's supply of ventilators, intensive care beds and personal protective equipment should be sufficient to handle a projected peak next month in COVID-19 cases, according to modelling information released Wednesday. Under the most likely scenario, first revealed by Premier Jason Kenney in a televised address on Tuesday, Alberta would see as many as 800,000 confirmed and suspected infections and between 400 to 3,100 deaths by the end of the summer. The peak in cases is projected to occur in the middle of May. Under that scenario, the peak of hospitalization would be in late May, with about 818 Albertans requiring hospitalization. About 232 patients would be expected to require critical care by late May and early June. \"Modelling is an estimate based on the best known data at the time that the model is put together,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. \"But we will continue to adjust it based on emerging Alberta data and evidence. So you will ... see this model evolving over time.\" Albertans can help bring the numbers down further by following public health rules aimed at preventing spread of the virus, she added.   \"Changing our total infections in the province is in our hands,\ " Hinshaw said. \"Every action makes a difference.\"   The province updated its COVID-19 case numbers before the start of the news conference. Alberta reported 50 new cases Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 1,423. Three more deaths were reported, bringing the total so far to 29. There have been 519 recoveries. Ramping up health-system response As a precaution, Alberta is ramping up its ICU, ventilator and personal protective equipment capacity based on an elevated, but less likely scenario.   Under the elevated scenario, 1,570 Albertans would require hospital beds by the beginning of May, with 392 of those cases requiring intensive care.   The elevated model would see as many as one million infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. System couldn't handle 'extreme' scenario An extreme model, with 1.6 million infections and 16,000 to 32,000 total deaths was provided to show how the virus would have spread if Alberta had not taken mitigation measures like closing businesses, schools and public buildings, and encouraging people to stay home. Alberta's health system would not be able to handle this scenario.    The information released on Wednesday outlines the assumptions used by health officials to come up with their models.   The most likely scenario includes an assumption that each person with COVID-19 will infect one to two other people. Other assumptions include that not all cases will be detected, that there is no asymptomatic transmission, and that patients are infectious for 5 to 10 days.   For the purposes of health system planning, the scenarios assume all ICU patients will need the use of a ventilator and that generally, 14 per cent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, with five per cent needing time in intensive care.   Unlike other jurisdictions that have used data from other places to project the spread of the virus, Alberta is using data gathered through its own testing and surveillance. Officials say the models are fluid and will change as new information comes in. More ICU beds ready by late April Alberta plans to have an additional 1,081 ICU beds ready by the end of April, and another 447 ventilators, bringing the total number of ventilators set aside for COVID-19 patients from 314 to 761. The additional ventilators are coming from a number of sources, including the respiratory therapy programs at NAIT and SAIT, STARS air ambulance, private surgical facilities and the Public Health Agency of Canada.   Transport, anaesthetic and pediatric devices that can be used for mechanical ventilation account for another 305 units; another 65 are new purchases by the province.   The stock of personal protective equipment is more than sufficient through to the end of April and into May. Alberta Health Services is showing shortages for the month of June, but officials say that doesn't account for the orders expected to be filled by then.    The province is adding an additional 315 acute care beds by the end of April by measures which include postponing non-urgent procedures. Alberta Health Services intends to increase staffing in the ICU by ramping up training for nurses, hiring recently retired health care workers, and moving nurse graduates through their practicums so they can start working. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the government should be planning for a worst-case scenario and she repeated her call for the government to take over staffing of seniors' homes, and prevent employees from working at more than one site.   Notley is also concerned of reports from health-care workers that they are being encouraged to wash and reuse their N95 masks.   \"There's a shortage, we need to start being honest about that,\ " she said.   While AHS believes it has enough supply of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), AHS CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said they also have to be careful. Yiu said the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommendations for sterilization and reuse of N95 masks.   Kenney has asked AHS to \"go as big as they can\" in procuring supplies.  He said Alberta is prepared to share with other provinces if they get more PPE than required.   ' I hope the models are wrong' In an address to Albertans on Tuesday evening, Kenney outlined two possible scenarios for the pandemic in Alberta. Modelling suggests as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections could sweep Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney says OPINION | Kenney delivers a stark but necessary message to Albertans Under the \"probable\" scenario, Alberta would hit the peak of infections in mid-May. From the beginning of the outbreak to the end of summer the province could see up to 800,000 total infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths. Under a more serious but less likely \"elevated\" scenario, infections in Alberta would peak at the beginning of May, with as many as one million total infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. In his widely watched Tuesday address, Kenney said public health orders designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus may have to stay in place until the end of May. \"As hard as this will be, it is the only ethical choice when thousands of lives are still at stake,\ " Kenney said. \"To be honest, I hope the models are wrong.\ "
  The federal government is finalizing a plan to boost production of ventilators and other medical equipment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior government sources tell CBC News they're hoping to work with existing manufacturers — especially of gloves, masks and ventilators — on a supply chain that's resistant to disruption. An announcement is expected from the prime minister on Friday, which will also encourage other industries to retool their production lines to make those products. In addition, sources say, almost every program within the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development will be \"refocused\" on fighting the virus. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly.   Major federal programs — such as the Strategic Innovation Fund, a pool of money set aside by Ottawa in 2017 to \"spur innovation for a better Canada\"; and the $950-million Innovation Superclusters Initiative — will be \"tasked to be part of the solution,\ " one source said. WATCH | PM says military procurement could help produce medical equipment: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not rule anything out when it comes to ensuring Canadians have access to enough medical equipment, including using military procurement as a possible option. 0:47 The National Research Council of Canada, the country's primary research and development organization, will also be part of the response. The goal, the source said, is \"to fight COVID and help come up with a cure.\" Ventilators in particular, could spell the difference between life and death for many patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus which can damage the lungs. Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said that while there is no current shortage of ventilators, federal officials are trying to prevent one by managing existing inventories and securing more of the machines — preparing for the possibility that the COVID-19 caseload could start overwhelming hospitals. In a conference call with more than 300 Canadian business leaders on Thursday afternoon, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains said he is looking at \"how we use our current industrial capacity to … build some of those very essential pieces of equipment, from ventilators, to gloves, to gowns, to masks.\ " Federal cabinet considers leveraging military in mobilizing health manufacturing sector against COVID-19No Indigenous community will be 'left behind' in COVID-19 response, says minister Bains said he is \"finalizing some of these details\" with cabinet to fast-track procurement. \"Those are going to be critical for frontline health workers and how we deal with this crisis,\" he said on the call. The World Health Organization warned last week of global shortages and price-gouging on ventilators and personal protective equipment, and urged companies and governments to increase production by 40 per cent. Canada's automakers and aerospace manufacturers have recently been in talks with federal officials about stepping in to fill critical shortages of medical supplies. Both the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and Aerospace Industries Association of Canada said they have spoken to officials from Ottawa. Meanwhile, high-end parka maker Canada Goose said it's in discussions about making medical gowns. Its retail stores and in-house production facilities are closed until at least March 31. While working with companies already producing medical supplies is the preferred option, the sources say everything is \"on the table.\" But getting non-medical companies to produce unfamiliar, emergency medical equipment is no simple task. They face significant hurdles before they could build a complex piece of equipment like a ventilator, while other products need to be manufactured in a sterile environment. Government expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister It's not clear how long it would take for companies to reinvent themselves. Auto industry insiders say, for example, the process could take months for car companies. In the United States, auto giants General Motors and Ford said they have been chatting with the Trump administration about making ventilators. On Thursday, the prime minister said Canada might also use its military procurement policy to get medical equipment. \"We are considering using any measures necessary,\ " Justin Trudeau said at a news conference outside his home. \"We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well.\ "
  Canada's hospitals and health officials are looking at ways to boost the number of available ventilators to prepare for a deluge of very sick COVID-19 patients amid projections that they could run out of such life-saving equipment within weeks. While most people who get COVID-19 only face mild symptoms, the sickest end up in intensive care units and must be attached to ventilators in order to survive and recover. A new study shows Canada's most populated province, Ontario, could run out of ventilators quickly if the trajectory of the pandemic is similar to that in Italy. There, the coronavirus epidemic has already overwhelmed the health-care system, forcing doctors to make hard choices about which patients get access to life-saving resources such as intensive care beds and ventilators. Ontario has implemented school and restaurant closures and is encouraging social distancing among residents in an effort to stop that from happening, notes Beate Sander, a scientist who has been modelling the potential impact of the pandemic on the province's health-care system. \"What our modelling is showing is that if we cannot keep these interventions in place ...  we're going to run out of capacity really, really quickly — likely in the next two weeks, Sander said.   Sander is a University Health Network Scientist and an associate professor at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. She and her colleagues looked at a variety scenarios that estimated when the hospital system would run out of resources without an increase in ventilators and ICU beds. The study was published online by the researchers Thursday, but has not yet been peer-reviewed. It found that even under a \"conservative\" scenario where cases increase only 7.5 per cent per day, ventilators would run out after a month. That's because very sick patients tend to spend one to three weeks in hospital, Sander said.  \"They're piling up.\" COVID-19: What you need to knowVentilator manufacturer says Canada should have stockpiled machines after SARS In total, Ontario has 2,000 ICU beds and 1,300 ventilators, but most are in use. Sander suggests 25 per cent be freed up for COVID-19 patients by cancelling elective surgeries and discharging patients. She said her main concern now is that Ontario keep up its social distancing measures and that \"we absolutely do the planning and ramp up our capacity of ventilators and ICU beds. It has to happen.\" Creative solutions to acquire more ventilator capacity Meanwhile, hospitals are looking at creative solutions. Dr. Alain Gauthier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital, has rigged up ventilators to be able to ventilate two patients at once instead of one. He did that by following YouTube videos created by two Detroit doctors in 2006. \"At one point we may not have other options,\ " Dr. Gauthier told CBC News. \"The option could be well , we let people die or we give that a chance.\" Watch: Does Canada have enough ventilators? Fearing a potential shortage of ventilators, one rural Canadian doctor has rigged up a fix. 2:04 The hospital currently has four new ventilators and four in reserve that can't be repaired.   Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said Thursday that the federal government hasn't received any requests for ventilators from provincial health authorities, but has been acquiring some for its stockpile. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said Canada could do what the U.S. and Italy are doing: getting military forces to help with the production of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Ontario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half : study Ontario's health minister, Christine Elliott, has assured the public there are enough ventilators for now — and 300 more have been ordered. \"We've procured 300 more ventilators to add to the 210 we currently have in surplus,\" said Elliott's spokesperson, Hayley Chazan. \"We continue to work on procuring additional ventilators.\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Canadian automotive supplier and manufacturer Magna International has also committed to help with the production of ventilators. \"We can't rely on importing these ventilators,\ " he was quoted by Reuters as saying. Perth doctor rigs up solution to feared ventilator shortageGovernment expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister One U.S. company that manufacturers ventilators told CBC News earlier this week that it has stopped all international shipments, including those to Canada, due to large orders from U.S. emergency organizations. Supply is also being squeezed by large orders in Europe. Germany has ordered 10,000 new ventilators and Italy has ordered 5,000, NBC News reported. 
  Click here for the latest: COVID-19 in Sask: Top doc recommends expanding testing to those who haven't travelled   There are now 72 cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, up from 66 on Monday.   Of those cases, four are instances of community transmission: cases where no clear cause of exposure, including travel, has been found. Two of the community transmission cases are in Saskatoon, one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community. An early, worst-case scenario drafted by the province says as many as 15,000 Saskatchewan residents may die from the virus. The estimate is a necessary part of planning and is being refined, the province says. More ventilators are on order, but the health minister said he doesn't know when they'll arrive.   An internal document from the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) says that, even using conservative assumptions, \"COVID-19 will almost certainly overwhelm\" the province's health system. The 20-page presentation, titled COVID-19 Planning Doc: Strategy for Continuity of Health Services and Surge Capacity, was recently circulated among SHA employees, but was leaked to the media Tuesday.   It raises serious questions about the province's current readiness to combat the COVID-19 virus.   \"Demand for acute services will exceed existing capacity for hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators as well as creating a major burden on other acute services, supports, HR, supplies, and equipment,\ " read one page from the PowerPoint presentation, which is dated March 19-20.    Saskatchewan government failed to order key equipment and supplies until after COVID-19 arrived   1st sign of community transmission The document's release came on the same day Saskatchewan reached a new milestone in its continued fight against the coronavirus. The province confirmed four cases of community transmission — instances where health officials could not determine how people got exposed. Two of those cases are in Saskatoon, one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community.    COVID-19 in Sask : Top doc recommends expanding testing to those who haven't travelled   \"You have to act anywhere in Saskatchewan as if there's unknown human transmission,\" said Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, at a news conference Tuesday. \"That's not a reason to panic,\" he added.  \"It's a reason to be very thoughtful about day-to-day activities. You're going shopping, you bring your groceries home ... you wash your hands.\" Saqib Shahab, chief medical health officer, speaks at a COVID-19 news update at the Legislative Building in Regina. (THE CANADIAN PRESS) On Tuesday afternoon, WestJet flagged more than a dozen of its recent flights as having had guests who tested positive for COVID-19.

Of the 72 cases, two are 19 years old or younger, 59 are between the ages of 20 and 64, and 11 are 65 years and older. Here's how the cases break down regionally as of March 24:   (CBC) Here's how the number of cases in Saskatchewan has increased over the past two weeks:  'Worst-case scenario planning'   A health authority spokesperson said Tuesday the internal document was \"a draft document based on early modelling and worst case scenarios.\"  Read the full document here.    A statement made last week by the province's chief medical health officer suggests the document — which posits a 30 per cent infection rate — may not actually depict the worst possible scenario. \"Over the course of 12 to 18 months, 30 to 70 per cent of us will get COVID-19,\ " Shahab said at March 18 news conference.   The internal document does note \"more accurate modelling is anticipated in the coming days,\" but says that action must be taken regardless. \"Even if there was a 50 per cent error rate, we still need to do this,\ " it says. In a note Tuesday afternoon, the SHA said other jurisdictions have used a 30 per cent infection rate in their models, but added that the Saskatchewan model is being updated so it's \"more specific to the situation in Saskatchewan.\" \"This plan will ensure we are prepared,\" said Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the health authority, in the note. \"But it won't be enough.  It has been proven over and over with this virus that no health system in the world can address this challenge alone without the sustained help [physical distancing and self-isolation] of the general public.\" Steps already taken At the news conference, Livingstone said the document did not take into account what the province has already done to prepare. That includes a slowdown of non-essential medical procedures to make more beds available, the shifting of health-care workers across the province and increased COVID-19 testing. \"We're doing surveillance in hospitals, testing for COVID-19 in all declared outbreaks in long term care homes,\ " Livingstone added.   Questions remain, however, about the readiness of the province's hospital system, especially when it comes to ventilators. Saskatchewan currently has 91 adult intensive care ventilators, 80 subacute ventilators and dozens of ventilators inside operating rooms across the provide, said Dr. Susan Shaw, the SHA's chief medical officer.    Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators.- Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter The document estimated Saskatoon alone would need between 500 to 600 ventilators once the pandemic reaches its peak.   Some 250 ventilators are on order for the province, health officials have said.  But Health Minister Jim Reiter was unsure Tuesday when they would arrive, and how many. \"Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators,\ " Reiter said. \"We're dealing with our normal suppliers, we're dealing the federal government because they're trying to co-ordinate and do bulk purchasing. \"I'm optimistic we're going to get some. I don't know if it'll be full orders and again it's virtually impossible.\ " Health Minister Jim Reiter said the province is working with the federal government to try to get ventilators at a time when many other countries are trying to do the same.   (THE CANADIAN PRESS) Up to 15,000 deaths estimated One page of the internal document, titled \"Key takeaways on incoming demand,\" estimates 9,000 to 15,000 people will die from the virus in the province. \"Early social distancing will delay and lessen the peak of the outbreak. However, even under conservative assumptions, COVID-19 will almost certainly overwhelm the health system.\" The same page says that \"over the course of the event,\" if 30 per cent of the province's population is infected, approximately 15,000 people will require ICU beds.   It says Saskatchewan currently has 109 intensive-care (ICU) beds province-wide. As of Monday, the health authority had 91 ventilators, with more on order.   \"At the peak of the pandemic, Saskatoon will need the capacity to provide ventilatory support [for] nearly 500-600 patients daily (ventilation and non-invasive ventilation),\" according to the document. The document also outlines a plan to significantly expand COVID-19 bed capacity to around 2,900 beds through the use of field hospitals at potential sites including gymnasiums, leased commercial space, community centres and arenas. The first step, however, is to increase the number of beds at existing hospitals, where specifics areas will be reserved for COVID-19 patients, Livingstone said during the news conference.   The province's mission statement is stated as follows in the document: \"SHA acute services will adapt and expand to meet the projected COVID-19 patient demand while continuing to deliver acute services to non-pandemic patients throughout the duration of the pandemic in order to minimize loss of life.\" One page suggests using rinks to house casualties.

So if we do the things we're doing now, that's the kind of numbers we might expect to see. But we don't have to see that. This is a critical moment. This is the moment at which we decide which track we're on.\ "  First recoveries expected soon Some good news about the pandemic's status in Saskatchewan may come by the end of the week, Shahab said.   \"We are now at the point where some of our initial cases are going to be screened,\ " Shahab said Monday. \"And if they are well, they'll be reported as recovered. We will be getting that information towards the end of this week.\ " The province announced its first case of the novel coronavirus on March 12: a 60-year-old man who had recently travelled to Egypt and tested positive in Saskatoon on March 9. Patients will be declared recovered once they test negative on a subsequent test, the health ministry has previously said.   As of Friday — when there were only 26 reported cases — the vast majority of those cases (24) were well enough to self-isolate at home.   No such insights have been offered since. Regular updates on in-hospital patients coming On Monday, Shahab said updates on how many cases are in hospital versus how many are self-isolating at home will be provided at least twice a week.   There are at least two COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan hospitals, according to the latest information provided. Both are there because of pre-existing medical conditions. However, the Saskatchewan Health Authority has not answered whether either of those cases has needed to go into intensive care, citing patient privacy concerns. Shaw said Monday that she did not have that information, and that if she did, \"it would not be appropriate to share it because of the importance of protecting our patients' personal health information.\ " In a later note, Jim Billington, press secretary for Premier Scott Moe, said \"it is our intent to provide information for the total number of cases in hospital and the total number of cases requiring ICU admission, when the information is reported [to the minister by the Saskatchewan Health Authority].\" CBC News has directly re-asked the health authority whether any patients are now under intensive care. As of Tuesday, 5,757 COVID-19 tests had been performed in Saskatchewan. Below is a graph showing how the cumulative number of tests has shot up in just a short while.  
  Saskatchewan reported 14 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, bringing its total to 220. Forty-eight people have recovered from the virus in the province, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. An assisted-living care centre worker in Regina has tested positive for the virus. A long list of professionals has petitioned the province to release inmates in light of the pandemic.   Saskatchewan's privacy commissioner says \"more information is better'\" during a health crisis like COVID-19.    The Saskatchewan Health Authority has offered an early glimpse at some of the factors health care teams might weigh to decide which COVID-19 patients get ventilators if there are not enough to go around. Dr. Susan Shaw, the SHA's chief medical officer, said the details are still being finalized and, at the moment, remain hypothetical. \"We're not there right now,\ " Shaw said in an interview Thursday.   While it's not clear, cumulatively, how many of Saskatchewan's COVID-19 cases have needed a ventilator, the maximum number of coronavirus cases who have been under intensive care (ICU) at the same time is known to be two.   As of Thursday, four COVID-19 patients were in hospital in the province, including two people in ICU.   Shaw's colleague Dr. Saqib Shahab — Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer and the public face of the province's fight to \"flatten the curve\ " — said it's hard to know when the province might reach its infection peak.    \"Obviously at some point we want to see the curve going down. Is that going to be in four weeks, eight weeks? We really can't predict,\ " he said on Wednesday.     COVID-19 in Sask. : No telling yet when province will reach infection peak, premier says   The province currently has 450 ventilators and has ordered hundreds more. One early-draft planning doc, leaked last week, estimated that at peak infection time, Saskatoon alone might need 500 to 600 ventilators at a time.   Health officials in Saskatchewan and elsewhere have undertaken the grim but necessary exercise of contemplating who would get a ventilator should hospitals be swarmed with serious cases while not having enough machines to go around. \"One of the main purposes of actually having this work done in preparation is a part of our responsibility to avoid arbitrary decisions,\" Shaw said. \"Right now the decisions are made about what's best for the individual. And when you get into a situation where you're starting to actually face scarcity, the ethical principles shift to be what's best for society.\ " Dr. Susan Shaw is the chief medical officer for the Saskatchewan Health Authority. (CBC News) Age is not the only factor Decisions about which patients would get ventilators would be made by doctors and members of the health authority's ethics commities, Shaw said. The age of patients is a key consideration, but not the only one, she said.   \"It's actually one of a combination of criteria,\ " she said. \"To make decisions solely on age would be discriminatory and would not be the way we would want to approach this. It's age in combination with frailty, chronic disease and recoverability.\ " In the \"extremely unlikely\" scenario where two patients' criteria lined up exactly, the ventilator would go to the younger patient, Shaw said.   \"That's based on the principle called the goal of the life cycle, which is every individual needs to have the equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life.\"   At the Top of the Covid-19 Curve , How Do Hospitals Decide Who Gets Treatment?    What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?    No one would completely stop being cared for, however. \"That always applies no matter what the situation is,\ " Shaw said. \"This means making sure that we never abandon the patient.\" Medical health professionals elsewhere have also contemplated the notion of a lottery.   While Shaw stressed that that option is not in Saskatchewan's current way of thinking, she is familiar with the concept. \"My understanding is that if you ever got into a tiebreaker situation where absolutely everything [including age] was identical — and again I think this is absolutely hypothetical — then a lottery is one of the ways that you could tackle that.\" New numbers,  Regina worker tests positive Friday's daily update from health officials included 14 new cases, bringing the total provincial tally to 220. Shahab said the comparatively low daily case additions in Saskatchewan — which have averaged 14 per day, after the province saw its largest day-over-day increase of 30 on March 27 — \"are to some extent reassuring.\" \"However, we are seeing that less and less of those are due to travel,\" he said. Of the total 220 cases, 102 are recent travellers, 52 tested positive because of exposure to someone they live with or after they attended an event, 10 have no known exposures and 56 are still investigation. The province added yet more detail to its daily report, for the first time specifying what region each fatal victim of the virus came from.   Sask. should 'lower privacy bar to serve greater good,' says health analyst   Shahab was asked about specifying which community an infected person came from (beyond Saskatoon and Regina). \"As our numbers increase that becomes easier to do,\" he said.   Here's how the cases break down regionally.   (Duk Han Lee) The province said a worker at Eden Care, an assisted living facility in Regina, has tested positive for the virus. The person was identified by another positive test case, through the process known as contact tracing.   \"There are no indications it has spread to other employees or residents,\" the health ministry said in a release. \"The facility is closed to admissions, discharges and transfers, and residents who have been in close contact with the employee will be isolated and monitored twice-daily for 14 days.\" Effective Friday , all people working in long-term care facilities in Saskatchewan will have their temperatures checked and will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms before beginning their shifts. On a promising note, 48 out of 220 people have recovered from the virus, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. Pandemic planning updates coming next week Premier Scott Moe said Thursday that he had asked the health authority to publicly release updated projections of how many people in the province might become infected and die from the virus, under various scenarios.     COVID-19 in Sask: Internal draft gov't document outlines 'worst case scenario' of up to 15,000 deaths    That update — which will also touch on planning for field hospitals and COVID-19 care in existing hospitals — is expected early next week. \"They all do fit together,\ " Shaw said of the modelling, the operational plan and the ethical framework for decision-making.   \"We want to share it,\ " she said of the ethical framework. \"It's not quite ready to be shared but it is ready to start being talked about.\" 'None of this can be rushed'   A front-line aspect of Saskatchewan's pandemic planning has come to light thanks to a Facebook post on Thursday. A health care worker shared photos of herself and colleagues at Royal University Hospital clothed in face shields, gloves and full-body suits. They were practicing intubation on \"Harold.\ "   \"Harold is a simulation dummy for the newly formed intubation teams to practice on,\ " the worker wrote. \"We are teams of anaesthesiologists, AAs and nurses who practice and train day or night every shift until there is a real patient with COVID-19 who cannot breathe on their own. \"I am grateful that we have this time to get prepared,\" the worker added.   Health providers at Royal University Hospital have practiced intubating on a COVID-19 patient using this dummy, named 'Harold.' (Facebook) Shaw confirmed this type of COVID-19-specific training has gone on for at least two weeks. \"Putting a breathing tube in somebody is a very routine activity for an anesthesiologist and many other health care professionals,\ " Shaw said. \"But how do you do it [properly] while appropriately donning and doffing equipment?\ "   Shaw even joined in the exercise later on Thursday.   Spent my evening at RUH ICU with <a href=\"https://twitter.com /SaskHealth?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@SaskHealth</a > anesthesia airway team practicing scenarios to safely care for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19SK?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19SK</a> patients<br><br > Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands&mdash;@drsusanshaw \"Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands,\ " Shaw wrote on Twitter. ' Staff safety is the number one priority' The health care worker who posted on Facebook said putting on and taking off equipment takes a long time, but with good reason. \"So that we health care people can be as safe as we can,\ " she wrote. \"None of this can be rushed as staff safety is the number one priority.\ " During Thursday's provincial COVID-19 news conference, Moe said the procurement of more personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers was his top priority on a call that same afternoon with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other premiers. The health worker wrote in their Facebook post that the trainees weren't wearing N95 masks in order to \"save them for when they are actually needed.\ " At the same provincial news conference, Shahab cited instances where it was not initially known a patient had respiratory symptoms and so health care workers were not wearing the right PPE. Shahab said patients should always phone a clinic instead of just going there.     COVID-19 in Sask : 6 more health care workers infected with virus, top doc says   The health care worker training for COVID-19 intubation had some advice too. \"You definitely don't want to become a Harold. Stay home, and stay safe.\ "
  The provincial government is refusing to discuss numbers of ventilators in northeastern Ontario hospitals, but assures the public that there will enough if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse. The Northeast Local Health Integration Network, the provincial agency overseeing the health system in the region, directed the question to the Ministry of Health. The ministry says it has a stockpile of 200 ventilators ready to be distributed across Ontario and has 300 more on order, but didn't answer CBC's question about how many of the breathing machines are in the northeast now. The region's largest hospital Health Sciences North in Sudbury, which isn't providing any staff for media interviews during the COVID-19 crisis, says it has 62 ventilators and isn't worried about a shortage thanks to that provincial stockpile. The Sault Area Hospital has started putting up tents to help handle extra patients who may come during a COVID-19 outbreak.   (Submitted by Sault Area Hospital ) Dr. Rishi Ghosh from the Sault Area Hospital says they have 12 ventilators, but four of them are on loan from the province to deal with patient surges and could be moved elsewhere. \"We're anxious about how many patients are going to need these and if we have enough to provide all the patients,\" says Ghosh, the medical director of critical care and cardiology. He says the Sault Ste. Marie hospital also has several machines that help people with chronic lung problems, plus ventilators used during surgeries that could help COVID patients \"in a pinch.\ " \"These things can change in a flash, so if we get an influx, it's very easy to use up 10 or 12 vents in a couple of days,\" says Ghosh. Sudbury's Health Sciences North issues plea for personal protective equipmentHealth Sciences North now screening all visitors to Sudbury hospital He says plans are being put in place to establish \"hot and cold\" zones in the hospital to isolate those infected with coronavirus. Sault Area Hospital is also setting up tents outside to deal with extra patients. Ghosh says the tough part will be if they have to decide who gets a machine to help them breathe and who doesn't. He says the reports from hospitals in areas hit hard with the virus have been \"horrifying.\ " \"We've been fortunate not to have a patient influx with COVID yet, but we think it's going to happen based on the rapid rise in numbers that we're seeing throughout Canada and the U.S.\" he says. \"We've never dealt with something like this before.\" While there are now three dozen COVID-19 cases in northeastern Ontario, very few have needed to be admitted to hospital.   (hxdbzxy/Shutterstock) Ghosh says there is not much in the way of treatment for a new virus like COVID, so it's best to keep patients out of hospital in the first place.   \"Really we're just trying to bide time for your body to overcome the virus and that's basically a salvage type intervention,\ " he says.   \"Certainly stopping the spread in the community is the best way to stay healthy and hopefully get through to the other side of this.\ " The provincial government is not answering CBC's questions about how many ventilators there are in northeastern Ontario. Health Sciences North in Sudbury says is has 62 and the Sault Area Hospital has 12.   (Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP via Getty Images) On top of doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists will be on the frontline of any COVID-19 outbreak in northern Ontario hospitals.   \"We're in the face of these patients. We do this all the time. We do it with TB patients, we did it with SARS, we did it with H1N1,\" says Sue Jones a respiratory therapist in Barrie and president of the Respiratory Therapy Society of Ontario.   \"That's what we do.\ " She says her members in the north are right now getting ready for a possible outbreak, figuring out what equipment they have, what they'll need and learning lessons from countries where COVID has spread rapidly putting ventilators in short supply.   \"If the numbers ramp up like we're seeing in Italy and Spain, then no , we won't have what we need,\" says Jones.   Mike Baker is the president and the CEO of the Temiskaming Hospital.   (Erik White/CBC ) Smaller hospitals in the northeast are counting their ventilators, but are more concerned with keeping their staff healthy during any possible outbreak.   \"Our hospital has four and I think that's a reasonable supply for a hospital of our size,\" says Mike Baker, president and CEO of the Temiskaming Hospital.    \"It's difficult to know, because we don't know where this is going to go.\" CBC InvestigatesSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 Ontario ICU bedsCBC ExplainsWhat is a ventilator and how does it work? The hospital in Mattawa has no ventilator machines. But president and CEO Pierre Noel says their job will be to take other patients in their 19 beds, so the North Bay hospital can handle more COVID-19 cases.   \"This is perhaps still the calm before the storm. Hopefully the storm will pass up by, but nobody is counting on that,\" he says.

  As emergency and intensive care doctors around the globe work frantically to save the lives of people gravely ill with COVID-19, one of the world's foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators. \"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen in Germany, gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation. The technique was first met with ridicule before being widely adopted. At the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, many emergency departments were immediately placing COVID-19 patients with alarmingly low levels of oxygen on mechanical ventilators, a standard practice for a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But in a paper published this week in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, Gattinoni and colleagues wrote that COVID-19 appears to diverge in key ways from normal ARDS, and that the usual recommended use of ventilators at high pressure that works for standard respiratory distress cases may actually harm some COVID-19 patients. Luciano Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen, Germany, says ventilators are being misused and overused during the COVID-19 pandemic. (CBC) COVID-19 patients, like those suffering from ARDS, have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood, which leads to breathing problems. In ARDS cases, the lungs lose their elasticity. But in many cases of COVID-19, the lungs remain elastic and people are able to continue breathing for some time despite the low oxygen levels. This \"remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS,\" he writes, adding that patients with normal looking lungs but low oxygen are at risk of lung injury from the ventilators, where pressure from the air damages the thin air sacs that exchange oxygen with the blood. In Gattinoni's study, only 20 to 30 per cent of patients fully fit the severe ARDS criteria. Different types of patients requiring differentiated types of treatment are best identified by CT scan, says Gattinoni. But if CT scans are not available, doctors can indirectly gauge a patient's needs based on \"surrogate\" measurements of lung stiffness, for instance, and other factors. With the standard ARDS treatment, Gattinoni says, people are put on a ventilator sometimes too late, or too early, with the ventilator's pressure set too high, causing damage. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayINTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   Marco Garrone, an emergency doctor at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, Italy, calls Gattinoni's paper \"a game changer.\ " He said it states clearly what he and his colleagues have been experiencing in the emergency room since the pandemic exploded in northern Italy in late February. \"We started with a one-size-fits-all attitude, which didn't pay off,\" Garrone said of the practice of putting patients on ventilators right away, only to see their conditions deteriorate. \"Now we try to delay intubation as much as possible.\" Factors such as the overall health of the person before catching COVID-19, or how sick they are by the time they arrive in hospital, could also affect how well a person fares. Oxygen without force Garrone says his emergency department now begins with non-invasive ventilation — different ways of getting oxygen into patients' lungs without force, such as a mask or a nasal cannula. This helps people in the early stages of the disease to inhale enough oxygen without damaging their lungs. A staffer works on a ventilator refurbishing assembly line in Sunnyvale, Calif., late last month. Hard-hit New York has reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. (Beth Laberge/KQED via AP) Doctors in New York state and elsewhere have voiced similar concerns about putting patients on ventilators too soon and with the pressure too high. Many have begun to delay their use, after New York authorities reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. However, the head of critical care at Toronto's University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital, cautions against drawing any firm conclusions from Gattinoni's paper. Niall Ferguson, who is also site-lead at Toronto General Hospital, also says with no data to back it up, the 80 per cent rate in New York is anecdotal and seems \"extreme.\" 'It's mostly a theory' Ferguson, who calls Luciano Gattinoni \"the E.F. Hutton of intensive care — when Gattinoni talks, people listen,\" recalling a once-famous brokerage firm ad, was one of the editors of Gattinoni's paper at Intensive Care Medicine. His observations about COVID-19 \"have generated a lot of discussion in the medical community and on Twitter,\" Ferguson said. \"But I think it's important to recognize that it's mostly a theory at this point.\ " With many IC units operating near capacity, he says, doctors do not have the time to randomize patients to one treatment protocol or another in order to study the effectiveness of each. The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) published one study earlier this month on the death rate of COVID-19 patients on ventilators in the hardest-hit Italian region of Lombardy. It actually showed a relatively low death rate on ventilators, 26 per cent, but Ferguson and Garrone both dismissed its results because many patients were still on ventilators when the data was collected and may have died after. Garrone said it's when ICU units get overwhelmed that the risk of misuse of ventilators is highest. ' It's been a constant flood' \"Everyone talks about COVID as being a tsunami, but a tsunami is a wave that passes. Here in Italy, it's been a constant flood,\" he said. \"ICU physicians in Italy are well-versed with ventilation. But these patients were so overwhelming in numbers that they trickled out of the ICU into the emergency department. And that's where we began to ventilate them.\ " 3.I have had to become braver about not intubating patients. I think we should avoid intubation if at all possible. I have previously been an advocate of intubating early to ensure safe, non-emergent intubating conditions. My perspective is shifting.&mdash;@jessica_bunin Ferguson agrees that the use of ventilators becomes an issue with doctors, pulled into a crisis situation, who are less experienced with the devices. But he said the IC community of doctors he's in touch with are well aware that treatment of COVID-19 patients needs to be individualized, which was Gattinoni's main point. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?CBC IN ITALYThe lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world Laura Duggan, an anesthesiologist at the Ottawa Hospital, told the Emcrit podcast for emergency and critical care doctors that, like many ICU doctors, she looked to intubate patients with low oxygen right away, but that she's \"happy to see that pendulum swinging back a bit\" to figuring out what else can be done. \"I think there is a balance to be had between finding something that's simple and widely applicable versus trying to still personalize things for each patient,\" said Ferguson.

' This will not be contained': Experts cast doubt that spread of COVID-19 can be stopped The World Health Organization has said the risk of COVID-19 spreading worldwide is now \"very high,\" and officials have suggested that efforts to combat the new coronavirus are still in the containment phase. However, some medical experts believe that the containment stage has long since passed and that the spread of COVID-19 is inevitable. \"This will not be contained, this has not been contained,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital. Massive public health efforts have been helpful in slowing down the virus's spread and reducing the pace and frequency of exported cases from China to the rest of the world, but containment has not worked, he said. In raising the risk level from 'high' to 'very high,' the WHO says it's signalling that countries must be prepared for initial cases of coronavirus.   0:55 Containment may have been possible had there been very early detection of the novel coronavirus and had China imposed massive control initiatives when the scale of the epidemic was much smaller, he said. The challenge is that coronavirus spreads efficiently from human to human, much differently than SARS or MERS, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security. Unlike SARS, where the symptoms were much more severe, a large proportion of individuals that are infected with coronavirus aren't sick enough to seek medical care, a significant factor in containing the virus. \"It's not something that we can prevent from happening in the absence of a vaccine,\ " Adalja said. \"It's not containable in the way that those viruses were.\ " Some experts have suggested the coronavirus will run its course throughout the world and burn itself out, while others believe it will integrate itself into the seasonal viruses that come around every winter, causing clusters of COVID-19.  Read more of this story here.

In brief It is illegal in Canada to pay a surrogate mother.  However, it is legal to reimburse her for pregnancy-related expenses such as additional food, clothing, vitamins and any transportation costs for her medical appointments. In some cases, the transactions are handled using a trust managed by a surrogacy agency. Over the course of a three-month investigation, CBC News spoke with dozens of people involved in surrogacy in Canada; their experiences reveal a burgeoning industry in which agencies lack oversight and mandatory transparency.  Read more on this story here. A surrogate gave birth to Anna Camille Tucci’s baby boy last December. She used a surrogacy agency to help her navigate the process and was left with serious questions about the payments she made. 9:43   Some family members of Canadian veterans suffering from mental health issues linked to their service say the federal government is cutting off their own publicly funded therapy. The crackdown was prompted by the embarrassing revelation almost two years ago that a convicted killer — the son of a former soldier — received PTSD counselling for the murder he committed. As Murray Brewster reports, those family members now want the opportunity to plead their cases before the Commons veterans committee when it reconvenes next month for hearings on the restrictions.  Read more about the fight over mental health counselling here.   When Iranian-born Canadian citizen Farzad Alavi was denied entry to the U.S. on Jan. 10, he said a border officer told him the reason was his past mandatory military service in Iran — which the officer claimed effectively linked him with terrorists.   At the time, Alavi had just suffered a horrific loss. Two days before, his wife, Neda Sadighi, was killed when Iran's military \"unintentionally\" shot down a Ukrainian plane after it took off from Tehran.  Read more about why Alavi claims the U.S. border service's reason for denying him entry is unjust.   Iran, in recent years, has made millions of dollars by taking advantage of its location beside Iraq and near Syria by providing a safe passage for foreign airlines to fly between Europe and Asia or from Asia to other areas of the world.  Iran made more than $100 million a year in overflight fees after the ISIS surge in neighbouring countries. According to several aviation experts, that revenue might have factored into the fateful decision not to shut down Iran's airspace the night Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down.  Read more about how money may have been a factor in the downing of the aircraft.

Maclean was tried for high treason and found \"not guilty, but insane.\"  1916:  Ontario passes a Temperance Act.     1938 : Lutheran pastor Martin Niemoller, who helped found the Confessing Church, is sentenced to seven months in prison for opposing German Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. \"First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist,\ " he said. \"Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.\"  1962:  Philadelphia 76ers centre Wilt Chamberlain scores 100 points in an NBA game against the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pa.   2000:  World and Olympic champion curler Sandra Schmirler dies in Regina of cancer at the age of 36. She skipped her team to three national and world curling titles in the 1990s, as well as the 1998 Olympic title in Nagano. 
  Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The province currently has 270 ventilators, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health.  An additional 16 have been ordered, Health Minister Cameron Friesen said Wednesday. Manitoba's population was roughly 1.38 million in the first quarter of 2020, according to Statistics Canada. That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive. The total does not include ventilators in operating rooms, which are a different type of machine not preferred for critical care or cardiac patients, said Lanette Siraugsa, chief nursing officer for Shared Health, on Saturday. Those machines could be used to treat COVID-19 patients in \"certain situations,\ " she said, but aren't the preferred method. Based on a CBC breakdown of reported ventilators and provincial populations across the country, Manitoba ranks roughly in the middle. Ontario, with a capacity of roughly 12.3 ventilators to 100,000 people, is near the bottom, while Quebec leads the country, with an anticipated capacity of roughly 35.1 ventilators per 100,000 people. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines. They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.   (CBC News) But countries around the world are facing shortages of the machines as the explosion of cases overwhelms health-care systems. In the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, doctors have been forced to decide which patients get priority access, and which do not. That's the scenario Canada is bracing for — and scrambling to prevent — by finding more machines. Prevention also includes flattening the curve through public health measures like social distancing, said Dr. Atul Kapur, an emergency physician in Ottawa and co-chair of the public affairs committee of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. \"Right now, we don't have anywhere close to the capacity or the number of ventilators for the demand that we're anticipating, by looking at what other countries [experience],\" Kapur said. When it comes to ventilators per capita, Ontario's near the bottom \"This is unprecedented. The estimates that we have had so far are just not holding up to the demand that COVID is causing,\" he continued. \"And even now, it's a bit difficult, because we don't know how bad it's going to get.\ " Manitoba preparing 'for the worst case': Top doctor Most Canadian hospitals operate near 100 per cent capacity \"at the best of times,\ " Kapur said. That means they don't have the \"buffer\" to handle a sudden surge in demand — and neither did many other countries. \"That's the problem,\ " Kapur said. \"We're fighting with every other country to increase our numbers.\" Canada's readiness is a \"mixed picture,\ " Kapur said. The country is orders of magnitude away from what it would need for its worst-case scenario. \"Even the best case scenario ... Right now, we don't have the capacity to deal with what that would be,\" Kapur said. \"But hopefully we have time, in a matter of weeks, to build that up.\" Health minister asks Manitoba businesses to provide products, supplies for hospitals during pandemic It's difficult to pinpoint an ideal number of ventilators for Manitoba because the path of the virus in this province could change based on multiple variables, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. \"There's a large variability in the modelling numbers that we have. And so we're looking to prepare not only for the expected case but we're looking to prepare for the worst case,\ " Roussin said at a daily news briefing Thursday. WATCH | Experts say Canada could come up against ventilator shortage in weeks Canada could face a shortage of ventilators within a few weeks if cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. 2:00 \"I don't have a specific number that I could tell you. But we are putting things in place to prepare for worst case scenarios, and so ventilators, critical care beds, those type of things, are part of that plan,\ " Roussin said. The province has called on private businesses to donate ventilators and other supplies. On Friday, Friesen said public health officials have also had talks with manufacturers to see if they could make more of the machines, or other needed equipment. There's also nuance behind the numbers, said Dr. Kelly MacDonald, the head of the section of infectious disease in the department of internal medicine for the University of Manitoba and the WRHA. Respiratory therapists are needed to run the machines. Unions have already raised concerns about staffing levels at Winnipeg hospitals. Respiratory care at HSC overburdened, understaffed even before COVID-19, unions say Health-care experts are also working to find alternatives. Kapur noted some doctors are working on ways to rig ventilators to help two or three patients at a time, instead of just one, for example. \"I think that providing good health care and survival has a lot more to do with a variety of other things, other than just the machines,\ " MacDonald said. Ability to 'change our destiny' in Manitoba: emerging virus expert One of the traits of a COVID-19 outbreak that makes it so hard on health-care systems is a pattern of sickening patients all at once, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. Across the world, health-care systems have seen a sudden influx of very sick patients all at once, rather than staggered, like with influenza, he said.   He hopes that Manitoba has had enough warning to take action and flatten the curve, so that impact won't be as overwhelming here. He praised Manitoba's actions so far on implementing physical distancing measures, and said Manitobans have done a good job of responding to the call so far. \"It's not necessarily just one variable where the virus hits and then you need all the ventilators,\ " Kindrachuk said. \"We still have the ability right now to kind of change our destiny a little bit with what's going to happen in Winnipeg.\ " It's critical for Manitobans to act responsibly now to mitigate some of the pressure that will be placed on the health-care system, MacDonald said. \"Ultimately, how this goes is going to be as much an issue of how we do as a society, as it will be an issue of how people do at hospitals.\ "
  Projected number of deaths in worst-case scenario is now around 3,000.    Overall number of cases in worst-case now projected at about 255,000.    New calculations include rate of transmission based on compliance with restrictions.    SHA to reduce maximum capacity by 1,000 hospital beds, 400 ICU beds and 400 ventilators.    The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will reduce the number of hospital beds, intensive care beds and ventilators it plans to make available based on new, lower projections for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Saskatchewan, including figures based on public compliance with restrictions. The updated COVID-19 Modelling and Health System Readiness document, updated from the first projections unveiled on April 8, shows the SHA is preparing for a worst-case scenario of about 3,000 total deaths and 60 daily intensive care admissions. \"We have flattened the curve based on what's gone on in the province: the three-legged stool around testing, contact-tracing and those severe public health restrictions,\ " said SHA CEO Scott Livingstone at a news conference on Tuesday.   \"What the model will help us do on a daily basis, weekly basis, monthly basis, is allow us to measure what's happening in the province, whether it's us reopening the health care system or the economy continuing on in phases.\ " Read the full document released Tuesday, April 28, here: Mobile users: View the document (PDF KB) (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content    The April 8 report said the authority was planning for between 3,000 to 8,300 deaths, and approximately 20 to 200 daily intensive care admissions, from COVID-19 at its peak.   The overall number of cases it is preparing for is now about 255,000. The April 8 document put that number between 153,000 and 408,000. The SHA will reduce its maximum capacity by 1,000 hospital beds, 400 ICU beds and 400 ventilators. The original modelling said the province thought it might need 963 ICU beds and 860 ventilators but did not specify how many hospital beds overall. The SHA said it will still have 83 more ventilators than it would need under the new projected scenarios.   'New normal' Despite the more positive outlook, Livingstone said what happens next is largely in the hands of the public. \"Our new normal is a normal with COVID in our population and in our province until a vaccine arrives and we need to plan that way.\" The original modelling was based on a basic reproductive rate, or R0, which is the average number of people that one person with the virus could infect,  of 2.4 to 4.0. This was based on if no interventions — such as restrictions and closures — had been taken. Regina case is lone new COVID-19 diagnosis reported Tuesday in Sask. Under the new modelling, which the SHA described as an \"improved outlook,\" the SHA is planning for an R0 of 3.12. The projection of about 3,000 deaths is based on that number. New calculations show current trend The new document also includes a new calculation: the effective reproductive number, or Rt.   According to the document, that number reflects the current trend and describes how well the various interventions are slowing the spread of COVID-19, with a lower Rt value being better. It also reflects fluctuating public compliance. On April 25, that number was pegged at 0.7, which the SHA said shows strong compliance with public health measures. The document notes that number could be lagging by 7-14 days.   \"If we don't stay flat then we know we're going to have to back off what we're doing with respect to providing more services and we will redirect those resources to COVID and we may have to start instilling more restrictions in the province again,\" said Livingstone. The new document states that the virus has reached a \"tipping point\" if the effective reproductive number reaches 1 or higher. \"Rt consistently [higher than] 1 is a major consideration in determining public health measures,\ " said the document. \"The Rt value is helpful in determining effectiveness of current interventions right now, and can be a guidepost to use when choosing to implement new measures, or loosen existing ones.\"   The Rt number will now be shared with the public weekly, the SHA said.   \"We definitely will be watching it and the goal of having the effective reproductive number is to be able to be aware and adjust as we need depending on how the loosening of the restrictions work as well as how everyone responds to them,\" said senior medical information officer Dr. Jenny Basran at Tuesday's news conference. She said there are efforts underway to develop Rt numbers for each region individually, but no specific numbers are available for the outbreak area in the far north at this time.   Basran said it is critical that the public continues to practice physical distancing and follow hand-washing guidelines.   The new modelling document does not set a date to resume elective surgeries and other medical services that are on pause. Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone says restrictions could be reinstated if the curve does not stay flat.   (CBC) Livingstone said any resumption of those services will happen in phases to balance COVID-19 care needs.   He said people have started shying away from seeking medical care from doctors and hospitals due to fear.   Data is now being used to try to assess how many people there are in the community with unmet medical needs, Livingstone added, to inform the next steps. \"The last thing we want to do is start burning through elective surgeries only to have our facilities fill up with people that have medical needs that we haven't met, or diagnostic needs that went postponed,\" said Livingstone. More details about the provincial strategy to increase testing — a measure promised to coincide with the loosening of restrictions — are also included in the new document. One of those measures is to start testing \"asymptomatic contacts\" identified through public health contact and outbreak investigations, along with outreach to populations perceived to be less likely to seek testing.   ' Saskatchewan is not two provinces' : Calls for more northern COVID-19 support continue It said testing is available at 50 sites across the province and the number of lab processing sites is being expanded from eight to 19. Tuesday's modelling document also includes Google data that indicates people in Saskatchewan have reduced their visits to grocery stores, pharmacies, transit stations and workplaces, but not as dramatically as in Canada overall. SHA's \"improved outlook\" for the province comes as leaders in northern Saskatchewan call for funding to help address an outbreak that has led to a public health order to restrict travel to and from the region.   As of Monday, there were 42 active cases reported in the far north and 10 in the north. 
  New York recorded its single greatest one-day jump in deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, but the state's governor pointed to signs that the state may be reaching a plateau in its wrenching efforts to limit the damage caused by the pandemic. The death count for April 6 of 731 marked an increase from the previous day's 599 new deaths, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told a daily briefing on the coronavirus. The overall total of casualties in the state is now 5,489 people. But Cuomo stressed that deaths were often a lagging indicator of patients who have been battling the illness for days or weeks. While new hospitalizations in the state crept up from the previous day's total, at 654, there were just 89 new admissions to intensive care attributable to the coronavirus. The ICU figure was the state's lowest total in two weeks and a sign for optimism as beleaguered hospitals, particularly in New York City and surrounding areas, have confronted escalating demands for scarce ventilators for patients and personal protective equipment for medical staff. But the toll is increasingly grim nationwide. According to the resource centre at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, over 11,850 people have died in the United States, a total that has skyrocketed since late March. There are over 378,000 confirmed cases, though experts consider the number understated due to a lack of testing capacity in many states. The resource centre has recorded 3,485 deaths in New York City alone. The U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a whopping increase of 3,154 American deaths on Monday, compared to its previous daily report. The CDC has put the country's death toll at 12,064 as of Monday at 4 p.m. ET. A person is tested for COVID-19 in the parking lot at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on Wednesday.

(Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images) The figures were updated after senior U.S. health officials from the federal government said Tuesday that they believe mitigation efforts are working nationwide, and that they now believe the coronavirus outbreak may kill fewer Americans than some recent projections. U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Tuesday said he concurred with the director of the CDC that some research models have projected death totals that may prove too high, though neither would offer an alternate estimate. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 6 The White House coronavirus task force projected a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000 a week ago, saying containing deaths to that range was possible if strict physical distancing measures were respected, implying it could go even higher. Adams on Tuesday told ABC's Good Morning America that he was encouraged by recent data showing a possible \"flattening\" of the outbreak in some areas, referring to the shape of the curve when deaths are shown on a graph. Asked if he believed the death toll would come in below the dire White House task force projection, Adams said, \"That's absolutely my expectation.\ " First responders carry a patient on a stretcher from a house on Tuesday in the Queens borough of New York City.

(Kena Betancur/Getty Images) A research model from the University of Washington — one of several cited by leading health authorities — forecasts 81,766 U.S. coronavirus fatalities by Aug. 4, down about 12,000 from a weekend projection. President Donald Trump has said any death toll less than 100,000 should be considered a successful response from his administration. Racial disparities 'take your breath away' Also tempering the cautiously optimistic tenor from Cuomo and federal officials, early data from U.S. states shows African Americans have been more likely to die from COVID-19, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care, experts said. Data from Chicago officials on Monday showed that black residents make up 52 per cent of coronavirus infections and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19. \"Those numbers take your breath away. This is a call to action moment for all of us,\" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. A woman wears a mask to try and prevent the spread of COVID-19 at a supermarket in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) On Tuesday, Lightfoot told a news briefing that her city has gone from coronavirus cases doubling every one to two days to doubling every nine to 10 days because residents have complied with the state's stay-at-home order. The city has documented 5,043 cases and 118 deaths. \"It's obviously progress,\ " Lightfoot said. \"But we are not near the peak  so I don't want to raise false expectations that it's coming sometime soon based on the modelling that we have seen.\ " CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold?5 myths about preventing infection Louisiana and Michigan have also reported rates of death from coronavirus among African Americans far greater than their representation in overall state population. Adams, who is black, told the CBS program, This Morning: \"We know that blacks are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease. And I have shared myself, personally, that I have high blood pressure.\" Governors of hard-hit states have criticized the government in Washington for what they see as a lack of centralized direction, a trend that continued Tuesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called for a \"massive post-mortem\" on the response both in his state and federally, while describing an \"unfathomable\" death toll of over 1,230 state residents. Murphy on Tuesday thanked California, which will be sending 100 ventilators. About 94 cer cent of the ICU admissions in his state related to COVID-19 require the use of ventilators, he said. \"From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. We will repay the favour when California needs it,\" said Murphy. We currently have 7,017 hospitalizations, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src =hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> positive patients and persons under investigations.<br><br>1,651 individuals are in critical care. 94% of those individuals – 1,540 individuals – are on ventilators.&mdash;@GovMurphy Trump, who has promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, attacked the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, accusing her in a tweet of having produced a \"fake dossier\" on American hospitals suffering shortages of personal protective equipment on the front-lines of the outbreak. Trump did not provide any reason for questioning the report on those shortages, which was based on a survey of over 300 hospitals in late March.

He added that he would work with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on the initiative with the goal of winning Senate approval on Thursday. It's not clear if Democrats will agree on the timeline.

  The dispatches from the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy are chilling.   \"Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone … Every ventilator becomes like gold.\" That was the message last week from Dr. Daniele Macchini, an Italian physician whose lengthy Facebook post was published in a local newspaper, translated into English and circulated on social media.   \"And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists; we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us,\" he wrote. Three professors from the University of Milan also sent a letter warning doctors in the rest of Europe to \"get ready,\" because 10 per cent of patients who test positive for COVID-19 end up needing intensive care.   \"This situation is like a bomb that explodes, and you're simply overwhelmed by an incredible number of patients,\" another Italian physician, Dr. Giacomo Grasselli, told the CBC News Network this week. WATCH | Italian doctor says coronavirus is like a bomb that exploded: Doctor at epicentre of Italian outbreak says coronavirus is a potential disaster for the entire world. 6:57 Grasselli is co-ordinating the intensive care response in Milan, the largest city in the country's hard-hit northern region. All of Italy's 60 million people are now under a sweeping lockdown, subject to travel and social restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Europe's worst outbreak of coronavirus. \"We're living this now,\" said Grasselli.  \"My mission is not only to take care of Italian patients, but also to tell other people in the world how to get ready for this.\" There's still time to 'flatten the curve'   Canada still has time to avoid such a situation, experts say. As the global number of coronavirus cases nears 120,000 people in 115 countries, chances of stopping its spread are now considered unlikely. So public health officials have turned their attention to slowing it down.   And the key is to \"flatten the curve\" — a reference to an epidemiological graph of a disease outbreak.   A large spike on that graph, representing a sudden increase in people with infections, can be catastrophic even for health-care systems in highly developed countries like Canada. This graph demonstrates the impact public health measures can have in 'flattening' the curve of a disease, slowing down virus transmission and easing pressure on the health-care system.   (CBC News) \"If you can slow it down enough and flatten the curve, so the same number of people get infected, but over a much longer period of time, then ... what you're allowing is that the capacity will not be exceeded,\" said Dr. Anand Kumar, a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Science Centre.   \"And that protects the community, so that an ICU bed will be available when it's needed.\"   Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus Extreme measures: European governments pull out the stops to slow COVID-19   Most healthy people will experience a mild COVID-19 infection because their immune system will protect them. But so far, the experience in Italy and China suggests that as many as 10 per cent of people infected can require critical care.   That creates an urgent need for beds in intensive care units, along with ventilation, dialysis and other life support technology.  It also requires qualified health-care specialists to manage patients — excess capacity that Canadian hospitals just don't have.   We're at capacity most of the time.- Dr. Robert Fowler, critical care physician and researcher Most of the country's hospitals are already operating at 100 per cent capacity, a largely normal situation in Canada's health-care system.   \"We've got a system that is designed to meet what our usual demands are,\" said Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital. \"We're at capacity most of the time.\" Add to that the extra load from this year's bad flu season, and suddenly, even in Canada, there's a risk that care might not be available when patients need it. \"Ideally, you prevent people from being infected — but you certainly don't want to have everybody infected at once,\" said Fowler. \"We don't want to overwhelm the system.\ " But the Italians warn that could happen.   \"If you do not stop the spread of the disease, your health system — no matter how good, how efficient, how modern it is — sooner or later will collapse,\" said Grasselli. \"Because the number of patients is too high for the resources we have everywhere in the world.\" Customers complain of price gouging as hand sanitizer sells out in storesCancel some events, but COVID-19 shouldn't force moratorium on all public gatherings, experts say That's why in Canada (and elsewhere) large events are being cancelled, some people are being told to work from home, and some students will be taking courses online for a few weeks. It's a temporary public health strategy aimed at slowing the potential spread and buying time. \"That's what people are trying to do to try to prevent the spread right now so we don't get overwhelmed,\" said Fowler. \"And it's going to very much depend on how effective we are at preventing transmission in the community.\" Dr. Anand Kumar is a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre. He said 'flattening the curve' of COVID-19 infections in Canada will ensure that critical care beds are available for everyone who needs one.   (John Woods/The Canadian Press) Another complicating factor is the fact that there is no vaccine and there are no drugs to treat COVID-19.   \"In this particular circumstance, we're not going to have a vaccine for at least a year, if not a year-and-a-half,\" said Kumar. \"And there's no known antiviral drug for coronavirus, so essentially all we can offer is supportive care.   \"If you get mildly ill, there's not something we can give you to stop you from getting severely ill. So what's going to happen is going to happen. And we're just going to have to try to support patients as best we can.\ " The importance of beds, ventilators Fowler led a team of researchers that conducted a survey of Canada's critical-care capacity after the 2009 H1N1 epidemic. At the time, there were about 3,200 ICU beds and almost 5,000 mechanical ventilators spread out in 286 hospitals across Canada. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines that will be critical for COVID-19 patients whose lungs are so badly damaged they have trouble getting enough oxygen.   The survey concluded that intensive care resources vary widely across Canada and \"during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients.\" Ontario, for example, had an extra 209 ventilators stockpiled and spread out across the province as of last August, according to one provincial document.    Canada's hospitals are counting their ventilators, used to assist breathing in critically ill patients. Experts warn that Canadian hospitals have limited space and capacity. That's why slowing the spread of COVID-19 is important to preserve that capacity.    (Craig Chivers/CBC) \"The physical space within a hospital to care for people is, I think, probably even more challenging beyond the physical number of ventilators,\" said Fowler.   Kumar is particularly concerned about the number of qualified staff to handle a possible surge in patients.   \"The bottleneck is in manpower, even more than physical space and even ventilators,\ " he said. \"I think everybody is contingency planning for the possibilities.\ " Some of the challenges now relate to approaching the management of COVID-19 on a national scale — and being ready to help regions that are hit harder, experts say.  That may involve moving equipment and health-care workers to where they are most urgently needed. A Newfoundlander is leading the global fight against COVID-19, and wants you to know the factsAnalysisIn 2003, Canada failed the pandemic test. Here's what we've learned since \"There's patchiness in where these outbreaks hit,\" said Fowler.  That means doctors and nurses can be completely overwhelmed in one place, but it can be business as usual in the rest of the country.   In Italy, health-care workers are already talking about the grim reality of \"triaging\" under strained circumstances, which means they're being forced to choose between life and what might have been a preventable death for some people, based on the availability of ventilators and ICU beds. Canada has studied the concept of such triaging, but Fowler said so far no system has been established.   \"In Canada, we don't really have a working example of what that would look like and we haven't had to do that,\ " he said. \"We shouldn't be having that conversation ahead of the conversation about when a place gets busy, how can we bring support.\"  
  McMaster University researchers are about to find themselves in the middle of a race against time to test treatments that could save people from COVID-19's nastiest symptoms — and results could come in just two or three months. Dr. Richard Whitlock, a cardiac surgeon and intensive care physician at Hamilton Health Sciences who is helping lead one of two clinical trials, told CBC News they expect to get approval from Health Canada in days to start studying how effective various medications are on COVID-19 patients. The virus, which has infected nearly two million people globally, has yet to meet a treatment that can beat it. \"Globally, the life loss is just tremendous, on top of the people that survive who get very sick, there may be life-long implications of morbidity that they're suffering because of damaged lungs,\ " Whitlock said. \"I don't think it's going to be gone sooner than we hope. These viruses tend to work in cycles so we may see multiple waves of this, we could see a repeat in a year … there could be a new normal established in our lives for the next few years.\" A proving ground for COVID-19 treatment U.S. President Donald Trump and others have praised a malaria medication and anti-inflammatory called chloroquine (also known as hydroxychloroquine) and the antibiotic azithromycin as potential saviours — both of which will be included in the McMaster study. \"Right now, there's no data that they work,\ " Whitlock said. \"There's small studies suggesting 'maybe, this looks good,' there's other studies saying 'no way, this isn't working,' but they're so small we can't have confidence in these. What we have is the ability to do a study of several thousand patients such that we can answer the question 'does it work' with confidence.\" HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents)..... &mdash;@realDonaldTrump The research from the Population Health Research Institute, McMaster and HHS will involve at least 500 COVID-19 patients in hospital and 1,000 patients who aren't in hospital, but Whitlock said he expects between 4,000 and 6,000 people to be involved in the program over time. Outpatients will either get supportive care, the current method of treatment or a combination of chloroquine and azithromycin. In-hospital patients will receive supportive care, the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin, and some will also have that mix with the addition of interferon-beta, which is an immune-modulating drug used in multiple sclerosis patients and can act as an antiviral.   Patients fighting off COVID-19 will have a chance to try medicine that could rid them of their symptoms. (Bobby Hristova/CBC) While this wouldn't be a vaccine, which stops COVID-19 before it infects people, it could be a treatment to save lives or prevent the need for intubation and respirators. Every 50 patients in, Whitlock said, a data safety monitoring committee will review the results and see if the medication is working as expected and if patients are recovering. If not, they may turn to other treatments such as using the antibodies within the blood plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients — another McMaster study set to start in as early as two weeks. \"It has protected antibodies which has helped them fight off the virus and so if you take that plasma from people who have recovered and give it to people who are fighting off the infection  currently in the hospital, it might be able to get them better\" Dr. Arnold, the lead researcher and director of the McMaster Centre for Transfusion Research, said. Researchers want blood from COVID-19 patients The Canada-wide study will involve roughly 1,000 COVID-19 patients. Half will get standard care and the other will try the convalescent plasma therapy, which has been used during other pandemics, including the Spanish flu of 1918. But this test, like Whitlock's, will be a proving ground for the treatment. \"This is certainly a promising therapy and people are excited about it but we don't have enough information right now to say that this is going to work,\ " Arnold said.

It will also rely on recovered COVID-19 patients to donate blood plasma for the study. Blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients could be the key to treating others still at the mercy of the virus. (AFP/Getty Images) Whitlock's team and Arnold's team have gone from the idea stage to the trial stage in just a few weeks — a process that normally takes half a year. \"Everything is happening at lightning speed,\ " Arnold said. Both studies will also need millions of dollars of funding, though the teams are confident they won't have an issue raising money as there have been \"discussions for supporting the trial\" with multiple levels of government and other industry partners.

INTERACTIVE | See the latest data on COVID-19 cases in Canada.   As global reported coronavirus case numbers pass one million — including 12,549 known cases in Canada — governments are scrambling to secure critical supplies, implement tough public health measures and deal with growing job losses.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with the country's premiers on Thursday about a range of issues, including the shortage of protective gear for health-care workers, an issue that emerged again Friday amid concern over whether Canada was getting the equipment it needs from abroad, including from the United States. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage on Friday, Trudeau said his government is \"confident\ " Canada will receive the necessary equipment. He said the government would do everything it can to ensure no part of Canada goes without the supplies it needs during the pandemic. Trudeau said his government has been working \"very closely\" with the Americans to make clear that essential supplies, products and services flow both ways between Canada and the United States every day, highlighting the example of nurses from Windsor, Ont., who travel to Detroit to work.   \"These are things that Americans rely on and it would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back-and-forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.\" WATCH | Trudeau talks about controversy around cross-border flow of critical supplies: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacts to the news that the Trump administration has ordered a major manufacturer 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 1:43 Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday that the Canadian-American relationship is very important. She said during a pandemic, \"all relationships\" face challenges and the cross-border one is no exception. Canada continues to work with 3M and its U.S. partners, Freeland said, adding that the government is working with a range of suppliers around the world. \"We are totally seized of this issue,\ " Freeland said when asked about the need to get medical workers critical supplies.   WATCH |  Freeland reacts to Trump administration's 3M order:   Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says the government will \"pull out all the stops\" in response to the Trump administration's decision to order 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 3:03 When asked about the U.S. blocking medical exports, Freeland said the Canadian government is prepared to do \"whatever it takes\" to defend the national interest. The prime minister said the government has signed a deal with Amazon Canada to use its distribution network to send medical supplies to meet provincial needs. Ontario releases coronavirus projections Faced with rising case numbers and tighter restrictions, there have been some calls for more information from governments about what is expected and what information is driving decisions. Trudeau has said that such national modelling is coming \"soon,\" but that the federal government requires more data from provincial and territorial governments — a subject he discussed with premiers during his more than two-hour first ministers' conference call. WATCH | Public Health Ontario head projects between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths over pandemic's full course:   The best case scenario for the number of COVID-19 related deaths in Ontario is 3,000-15,000 over the full course of the pandemic, says Dr. Peter Donnelly, the CEO of Public Health Ontario. 2:56 Ontario released its provincial projection and modelling information on Friday, with Premier Doug Ford saying that he wants the province's residents to know \"what I know.\ " The modelling projects the coronavirus crisis could last 18 months to two years and kill 3,000 to 15,000 people, even with public health measures in place. \"Had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\" said Public Health Ontario CEO Peter Donnelly, referencing the province's physical distancing and other measures. \"Thankfully, that is not the position we are in.\"   CBC EXPLAINS |  What you need to know about the new COVID-19 emergency wage subsidy 5 myths about preventing, detecting COVID-19   Donnelly said he understands these figures may seem \"scary, intimidating\" and to many, \"unlikely.\ " But, he said, every year about 1,350 people die from normal seasonal flu. In a bad year, 1,500 people die. \"When you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and you remember we have no vaccine, and we have no specific treatment …  then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible.\" A health-care worker wearing protective gear walks in front of a COVID-19 assessment centre at the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto on Friday. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press ) On Friday, Ford implored Ontarians to do their part to help ease the burden on the province's hospitals and announced more shutdowns — including some construction projects. Given the projections released today, it was the right thing to do, he said. \"Everyone has had to pay a price in this war,\ " he said. \"Daily life has ground to a halt.\" Speaking ahead of the release of the Ontario figures, Trudeau said again that \"how we get through this depends on you,\" and that Canadians are \"looking to do the right thing.\ " Trudeau has reiterated daily the need to practise physical distancing, stay at home whenever possible and practise proper hand hygiene.

Spain is closing Friday a black week, with its death toll for the new coronavirus nearing 11,000. More than half of those occurred during the past seven days. There are also more infections than any other country in Europe. The bottleneck in Spanish labs conducting the tests has led to relatively low levels of testing in Spain compared to other European countries, authorities have acknowledged. But even with statistics that are believed to be conservative in showing the extent of the epidemic, Spain on Friday neared 118,000 cases, second only to the United States. Official Health Ministry data showed that 7,472 of those infections had been in the past 24 hours.  Spain also registered 932 new deaths, 18 less than its daily record of 950 the day before.

(Colin Butler/CBC News) Here in Canada, health officials are urging the public to help slow down the spread of the disease in order to avoid what's taking place in Italy, where hospitals are running short of beds and ventilators as hundreds of critically ill people inundate the country's healthcare system.   A 2009 survey of the country's ICUs and emergency medical equipment revealed Canada has about 5,000 ventilators spread out across 286 hospitals.     Canadians being urged to help 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19    In Ontario, a 2014 survey showed the province has a stockpile of 209 critical care ventilators, but Strupat, a retired respiratory therapist, said that's not enough for what a pandemic could bring.   \"In Ontario, we have about 210 ventilators set aside and I think 40 of them are for children and babies,\ " he said. \"That doesn't match at all the numbers that are thrown out for a pandemic. That's not enough.\ " In Italy, a country that's been hit hard by the coronavirus, medical officials have said that about one in 10 patients who has COVID-19 requires some kind of intensive care. \"Those are really large numbers. If you take one per cent of the United States, for example, that's 3.5 million people, 3.5 million extra people in hospitals.\ " Ventilators could be in high demand John Strupat shows his pandemic ventilator prototype in action 1:29 It means ventilators would be in high demand, which is why Strupat dusted off his old prototype, designed to be cheaper and easier to manufacture and operate than a conventional ventilator.   \"We're talking about a device that we want to have available in the worst case conditions and strangely enough, COVID-19 is not the worst case envisioned,\" he said.   When Strupat first developed the device, it was for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In 2007, the agency was looking for a life support device that could run on batteries and be deployed cheaply and effectively in a potential mass casualty situation.   \"It was their effort to prepare for a really desperate event in the United States. So that could be nuclear war, a chemical attack or a biological attack.\" Strupat  said the coronavirus pandemic is not that far off.   \"It all has the same end result, you have an overload at hospitals with people who are sick and require medical care.\" The proposal never really worked out and Strupat never produced his device for the Americans, but he didn't give up. In 2009, with the help of a biochemist, he retooled the design and entered the \"pandemic ventilator\" into a contest for medical devices at York University. It won third prize.   \"First prize was a treatment for cancer, second prize was a diagnostic tool for cancer, so I'd say we did pretty well in that,\ " he said.    Life-saving device can be built for as little as $500 a unit The pandemic ventilator prototype, seen here, was originally developed in response to a request by U.S. officials for a life support device that could assist in a mass casualty situation.   (Colin Butler/CBC News) Strupat said that while a conventional ventilator found in a hospital costs about $25,000 for one unit, his design would cost about $500 a unit and with a couple of modifications, could be mass-produced quickly and easily.   The only caveat is the standard of care. While the standard for a conventional ventilator uses a mask or nose tubes and follows current guidelines, the pandemic ventilator is at a standard from the 1970s and requires a patient be intubated, the medical word used to describe putting a tube through someone's mouth and into their airway.   \"[It's] still a primitive device compared to a modern ventilator, but a device that's capable of basic life support,\ " he said. \"In a pandemic, who cares?\" One Italian doctor battling the coronavirus outbreak in his country compared the value of having ventilators to gold, but that's not what Strupat said he's after.   If anyone interested mass producing the pandemic ventilator, they're welcome to it, he said.   \"Someone can buy me a coffee if they want. It's a freebie. It would be great if it can help with something.\" 
  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has left intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19 and is \"in extremely good spirits,\ " his office said on Thursday evening. In a statement, a spokesperson at 10 Downing Street said Johnson \"has been moved … from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\" Johnson had been in intensive care for three days after his COVID-19 symptoms worsened. He tested positive for the coronavirus two weeks ago and at first had only \"mild\" symptoms. Johnson's spokesperson, James Slack, earlier Thursday said that the prime minister \"had a good night and continues to improve\" at London's St. Thomas' Hospital.

Earlier Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been deputizing for the prime minister during key meetings, said Johnson was \"making positive steps forward.\" U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the improvement in Johnson's condition was \"great news,\ " while news of Johnson's ongoing recovery prompted a small rise in the value of sterling against the dollar.

Not all the U.K. deaths reported each day occurred in the preceding 24 hours, and the total only includes deaths in hospitals. Johnson's government was slower than those in some European countries to impose restrictions on daily life in response to the pandemic, leading his critics to accuse him of complacency. Britain also had one of the lowest numbers of hospital beds per capita in Western Europe before the pandemic, with only about 5,000 intensive-care beds nationwide. That number has been increased vastly in the past few weeks, both by converting other areas of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and by building temporary facilities, including a 4,000-bed hospital at London's ExCel conference centre. Bank of England announces 'temporary' lending So far, British hospitals have been stretched but not overwhelmed, But some medics say they are struggling and still have not received adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE. \"We're still, by and large, wearing the same equipment that we were a few weeks ago,\" said Dr. Nishant Joshi, an accident and emergency doctor who works in a hospital north of London. \"We're getting a higher volume of patients, and they are more unwell and they're probably more contagious.\" Illustrations in tribute to the National Health Service are seen Thursday on a building near St. Thomas Hospital, where British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a third night in intensive care after his COVID-19 symptoms worsened. (Hannah McKay/Reuters) Slack, the prime minister's spokesperson, said \"we are confident that enough supply is now reaching the front line,\" and that the government was working urgently to sort out any distribution problems with protective equipment. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has agreed to temporarily lend the government money if needed to help finance its massive COVID-19 spending plans, reviving a measure used during the 2008 financial crisis. Short-term measure Sensitive to claims it is resorting to \"monetary financing,\" or permanently supporting government spending by printing money, the bank stressed its move was a short-term measure — with any money borrowed to be repaid by the end of 2020. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and the world on April 8 Bank governor Andrew Bailey said Sunday that monetary finance was anathema to central bankers and has linked it to hyperinflation in 1920s Germany and later Zimbabwe. \"As a temporary measure, this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cashflows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from COVID-19,\ " the bank said in Thursday's joint finance ministry statement.   Johnson's government has made historic spending and tax cut pledges costing tens of billions of pounds as the economy plunges into potentially its biggest downturn in over a century. The Bank of England has also worked closely with the government on joint measures to lend money to businesses hit by the crisis. INTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working? CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis 
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  Ontario has roughly a dozen ventilators per 100,000 people, putting it near the bottom of Canada's 10 provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesperson for the province's Ministry of Health told Radio-Canada Monday, after several requests, that until recently, Ontario had 1,300 hospital beds equipped with a ventilator. Another 210 beds equipped with ventilators are in its emergency reserve. The province received 300 more last week, which brings the total to 1,810 beds altogether.   Given Ontario's population was about 14.7 million at the end of 2019, that works out to about 12 ventilators per 100,000 people.    Quebec, on the other hand, has the highest ratio in the country. The province has approximately 35 ventilators per 100,000 residents.   In typical circumstances, however, about 80 per cent of ventilator capacity is taken up by emergency hospitalizations unrelated to COVID-19. That means the actual capacity for COVID-19 patients in Ontario is actually closer to two to three ventilators for 100,000 people. The ratios are based on figures from provincial health departments and ministers released over the last week, up to Monday.   Why Ontario's COVID-19 testing underestimates the spread of the virus Ottawa mayor declares state of emergency   Ventilators help people breathe when they are having trouble doing it on their own. They're especially important now, given that COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can seriously affect the lungs. The Public Health Agency of Canada says six per cent of the country's confirmed COVID cases have required hospitalization, while two per cent have required intensive care. A recent study by some of Ontario's leading medical researchers suggested Ontario will run out of intensive care beds and ventilators in late April, even if the province manages to cut last week's infection rates in half.   Private sector help Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday the government is working hard to make sure Ontario hospitals have enough medical supplies. That includes reaching out to the private sector for help. His government also said it's allocating medical equipment to hospitals where it's most needed. But Ontario NDP health critic France Gélinas told Radio-Canada the Ford government's responses are a sign the health-care system is underfunded. Medical staff members check a ventilator in protective suits inside the Koranyi National Institute of Pulmonology in Budapest, Hungary, on Tuesday. (Zoltan Balogh/The Associated Press) \"We ask our hospitals to function like superheroes all the time,\ " she said in French. \"The government has never invested to keep up with the growth of the population.\" Critical Care Services Ontario, a government body that was formed out of the SARS outbreak, said in a recent report the province set up its ventilator reserve in 2010 with 216 machines —  which is actually six more than it has now, a decade later. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario also said in a news release Wednesday the province should buy enough ventilators for the worst-case scenario and sell any it doesn't end up using to other jurisdictions. As of Wednesday morning, Ontario had 688 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with nine deaths. Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the province's assistant chief medical officer of health, said that as of Wednesday afternoon, 17 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units. Fifteen of them are on ventilators. Eight cases involving patients who've now tested negative for coronavirus twice in a row are considered resolved. 
  Canadian Broadway star Nick Cordero's recent leg amputation due to complications from COVID-19 is an example of a constellation of things that can go wrong during severe bodily infections, say doctors. The Hamilton-raised actor-singer's wife, personal trainer Amanda Kloots, said his right leg was amputated last weekend in Los Angeles after blood clotting issues arose while he was being treated for the coronavirus. Cordero was in a medically induced coma on various machines to support his heart, lungs and kidneys. While problems with organs and tissues can also unfold in other types of flu and critical illness, doctors say such cases highlight that COVID-19 can stretch far beyond a respiratory illness. As Montreal emergency physician Dr. Abdo Shabah explains, complications can arise beyond the typical flu and respiratory symptoms due to high levels of inflammation in the lungs, which can affect the level of oxygen in the blood and its delivery. That can put stress on the whole body and lead to issues with the heart, such as arrhythmia and unstable blood pressure, and infection in other organs including the kidneys and liver. \"The inflammation in the whole body triggered by this disease can affect the clotting path, and that is still under research,\" says Shabah, a board member at the Canadian Medical Association. \"It's very difficult to describe the clear mechanism, but we see that association with other organ failures, such as kidney failures or having other clotting factors.\ " Chinese doctors were first to sound the alarm about blood clots in COVID-19 patients. In March, Chinese heart specialists advised the American College of Cardiology to watch for clots and said certain blood tests showing a rise in clot risk might signal which patients were in greatest danger. Other reports suggested the clots can show up all over the body. But were they a cause of deterioration or an effect? And what role does treatment play in exacerbating some of the complications? Cordero was on a dialysis machine, a ventilator and an ECMO machine Patients with severe cases may need a ventilator to help the lungs, a dialysis machine to support the kidneys, and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to assist the heart and lungs. The 41-year-old Cordero was on all three at one point in his treatment. Like any medical intervention, such aggressive support devices can also pose a risk to a patient through infection, blood clots and other issues. But generally such machines are life-saving measures and their benefits far outweigh the risks associated with them, says Shabah. Clotting factors and organ failures are still \"minimal compared to the main general aspects of really severe pulmonary failure,\" says Shabah. \"So respiratory failure that happens is the main thing that worries us.\" Patients with severe cases may also require high doses of certain medications, such as inotropes or vasopressors, to support the heart and control blood pressure. \"What we see sometimes with high doses of vasopressure medications, is that it sort of robs some parts of the body from blood pressure in order to supply the core organs,\" says Dr. Rob Fowler of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. \"And so we see that maybe the skin, for instance, in the fingers and the toes will look like they have less blood supply and less oxygen there, because that's in part the way some of these medications will work.\" Patients over 65 are more at risk As with seasonal influenza, patients who are more at risk of having severe COVID-19 symptoms and complications are those who are over age 65, and those with underlying health conditions and chronic diseases, which range from heart disease and high blood pressure, to diabetes, cancer, obesity and lung disease. But Fowler says hospitals are seeing both \"the original presentation\" of COVID-19 infections and complications in greater numbers, which puts a bigger strain on the health-care system. \"A big thing with this whole outbreak is just the volume of patients that we will see is so much greater with COVID, because it's affecting a population around the world that's never seen it before, and so no one has any immunity to it,\" says Fowler. \"With all of these complications, there was the first issue about running out of ventilators. But then soon after that, people began to realize we might also run out of dialysis machines, because we're needing to use them in numbers in a short period of time that we're not used to doing.\" Medicine used to treat such cases is also running out. \"Medications to keep people comfortable, sedated when they're on breathing machines; medications to support blood pressure, for instance, are being used at a rate that exceeds the usual ability to supply many hospitals,\" adds Fowler, who works in a critical care unit. \"And we're seeing these almost-shortages or shortages on a daily basis because of this increase in global demand. And it's not just ventilators — it's all that goes along with supporting people.\" Shabah echoes Fowler's message that this is all putting stress on the health-care system, which requires synchronicity in order to function properly, including having enough trained staff and a good supply of materials . \"If we have all the majors in place , I think we could manage it very well,\ " Shabah says. \"And I hope as Canadians, we will be able to get all this set for the next wave.\ "
  It's been almost two months since Calgary filmmaker and video producer Judy Gabriel went to the doctor with a cough and a sore throat. Although she initially asked if she needed a COVID-19 test in late February, it was a month until she was given one — and even after she was confirmed to have it, she nearly didn't end up in hospital. Now, three weeks after she was discharged from hospital, she's nowhere near recovered. She's still coughing, her lungs ache and the breathing exercises she's been told to do hurt her chest and back.   She was diagnosed with bronchitis, then pneumonia and eventually COVID-19. She spent five days in intensive care, fighting not just the virus, but also the side-effects of the medication she was given, which included an anti-malaria drug. She's never experienced anything like it. When she was in intensive care, she didn't know whether she would survive. She remembers trying to cough up fluids from her lungs and not being able to breathe — all at the same time. \"I thought I was I was going to die,\ " she said. \"You know, trying to take it all out and kind of breathe at the same time is quite hard.\ " Gabriel, who is in her 40s, wants a retest to ensure the novel coronavirus has left her body, but provincial health officials say it's something they do only in rare circumstances, usually involving front-line health care workers. It started with a cough Gabriel, who recently moved to Lloydminster for consulting work, developed a cough on Feb. 27 and went to see the doctor, who suggested it was bronchitis. Gabriel says she asked to be tested for COVID-19, but the doctor said it wasn't necessary. She was given some antibiotics, a nasal spray and some cough syrup with codeine. She says she started to feel better a few days later and returned to work.   About a week later, her cough returned and it was back to see the same doctor, who suspected pneumonia. Gabriel says she had a fever, her body ached and her lungs were \"crackling and hurting.\ "  An X-ray was ordered and she was given flu medication and an inhaler.   At a followup appointment with the same doctor on March 20, a test for COVID-19 was ordered. Two days later, someone from Alberta Health Services called her to say she had tested positive for COVID and that she must stay home to self-isolate. Dr. Raffath Sayeed, a retired physician in Lloydminster, Alta., helped to convince Judy Gabriel to seek medical treatment after testing positive for COVID-19 last month. (Skype) Gabriel says her condition quickly deteriorated. She said she felt weak, fatigued and sore. She was nauseous and was getting sharp pains in her lungs every time she took a breath. She says it felt like someone was sitting on her chest.   She says every breath she took felt like her lungs were being cut. \"It feels like a knife cutting it, and it's burning,\ " she said. She was coughing, her head was pounding and she was sweating. She reached out for help on the Alberta Health Services' 811 health line, but she couldn't get through, so she called 911.   Gabriel says paramedics came to her apartment but were hesitant to go in. They gave her the option to either stay home or go to the hospital. She decided to stay home and fight.   Retired physician intervenes Gabriel says that, during her illness, Dr. Raffath Sayeed, a retired physician who is a friend of a colleague, reached out to her and urged her to demand immediate medical attention, to call 911 and insist that she be taken to hospital. She recalls he told her that she needed to get into the hospital right away and that her condition was going to take a turn for the worse. \"I heard what he was saying but I was so disoriented because I was just coughing, just trying to breathe,\ " she said. Sayeed told the CBC he was very concerned about Gabriel's health, considering \"the way she was breathing, the way she was unable to speak.\ "  The other concern Sayeed had for Gabriel was that she lived alone and didn't have anyone checking on her. \"I said, 'You have to call 911. And if you don't call 911, I will call 911 for you.'\ " On March 25, she made the call to 911 again, and this time she was taken to the Lloydminster hospital, which is on the Saskatchewan side of the city, a community of 30,000 people that straddles the provincial boundary.   \"I believe that she would have died,\ " Sayeed said. ' Just trying to breathe, get stronger'  Gabriel, who has worked in television and radio for two decades, managed to record several video clips with her phone while she was in intensive care, where she stayed for five days.   \"Just trying to breathe, get stronger … it's not easy,\ " she said in a whisper during one of the videos. \"It doesn't stop, it feels like my lungs are being stepped on,\ " she said in another video. In another clip, she referenced being on the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and antibiotics. She said her potassium levels were low and she was feeling very tired. Gabriel says it was the second or third day in ICU when she thought she wasn't going to survive. She says trying oxygen to breathe, while coughing and vomiting fluids from her lungs, was unbearable. She says she struggled to find \"a pathway to breathe.\" \"You just keep holding onto that breath and you breathe and try to go but it's hurting.\ " She says her heart rate felt \"low\" and it was scary.   \"You just feel like you're going, just going to shut down,\ " she said. Recovering at home   Gabriel was discharged from the hospital on March 29. Since she's been home, nurses from both Alberta Health Services and Saskatchewan Health have called daily to check in on her.   She's still coughing and has lots of aches and pains when she does her breathing exercises. She wants to be retested to make sure the virus has left her body and she's fully recovered. A retest seems unlikely.  Alberta Health Services says a person is considered recovered if they haven't required re-hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days following their date of discharge. Alberta Health is not reporting specific details about how many of the approximately 1,230 confirmed recovered patients have been retested. Gabriel says she knows it's going to take a while for her body to recover from the ordeal. \"I'm a fighter. I don't quit,\ " she said. \"You gotta keep going. Nobody else can help you but yourself.\"   Bryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

  As much of Newfoundland and Labrador shuts down out of caution, there are still no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the province as of late Friday afternoon. \"We are serious about containment of this virus,\ " Janice Fitzgerald, chief medical officer of health, told reporters late Friday afternoon, after a rash of cancellation and closure announcements throughout the day. The province has tested 62 people so far, with 46 of those confirmed negative. It continues to recommend that people refrain from travelling outside the province, in accordance with national advisories. Eastern Health says it has established an emergency operations centre for COVID-19 and an assessment clinic is being set up. A location has still to be determined. That clinic will be up and running by next week, according to an internal memo distributed by the regional health authority.  An algorithm has been developed to screen for potential cases of COVID-19, according to the email. Fitzgerald also provided the number of ventilators at the disposal of health authorities, saying there are 156 of the machines — which have proved vital for keeping severely ill patients alive — spread across the province. Rash of closures Municipalities also took drastic measures Friday to contain the spread of the virus in the likely case it arrives here.   All recreational facilities in St. John's, Mount Pearl, Paradise and Conception Bay South will close by Friday night. The municipal after-school centres, for St. John's and Paradise, will remain open. The N.L. government is closing provincially owned pools and training centres starting Saturday. Those include pools in Gander, Corner Brook and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Mile One stadium will also close its doors starting Saturday. Premier Dwight Ball hammered home the province's recommendation of cancelling any gathering over 250 people. \"This is for real. It's evolving,\ " Ball said Friday afternoon.  \"This is a very serious situation.\" Dr. Janice Fitzgerald says cancellations and closures across the province so far are appropriate and will slow the spread if the virus arrives here. (Malone Mullin/CBC) \"One of the key concerns now is transmission, and the idea is to keep down social interactions and keep larger groups from congregating,\" St. John's Mayor Danny Breen told reporters at a news conference late Friday afternoon. Public meetings at St. John's city hall and its facilities are cancelled. City council will continue to meet, but its weekly public meeting will be closed to the public. The meeting will be broadcast on the city's website. Non-essential gatherings of events of 250 people or more should be cancelled or postponed, the province said. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said Friday afternoon that schools will remain open, but is limiting large gatherings and has begun cancelling all international trips. It has suspended the community use of schools Those precautions are appropriate, Fitzgerald said — not overreactions. \"This virus is a virus that is new ...  We're still learning about it,\" she cautioned. \"These types of precautions have been found to be helpful in other places. And at this point I think we have to take every precaution we can.\ " Panic-buying toilet paper and canned food, however, isn't necessary to prepare, according to Fitzgerald.  \"Nobody needs to run out and buy mounds of things at this point,\ " she said, advising that two weeks' worth of essential medications and a little extra food would suffice. Sports seasons iced Meanwhile, thousands of children across the province will be disappointed to learn the remainder of their minor hockey season has been put on hold  — and the same goes for junior and senior hockey, after the province's governing body, Hockey NL, pulled the plug on Thursday night. Hockey NL has cancelled all sanctioned events for the time being. (CBC) This is a busy time of year for Hockey NL, with the St. John's Junior Hockey League and East Coast Senior Hockey League playoffs in full swing. The West Coast Senior Hockey League was set to start its final series on Friday. The St. John's Edge and Newfoundland Growlers will also be sidelined for the foreseeable future, as both the National Basketball League of Canada and ECHL have postponed their seasons. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCNL?ref_src =twsrc%5Etfw\">@CBCNL</a> Marble Mountain has been closed. General sense of disappointment amount the people slowly filing out to the parking lot. <a href=\"https://t.co/3qGHUFz4Vj\">pic.twitter.com/3qGHUFz4Vj</a>&mdash;@IvanJWhite Marble Mountain will also close for the rest of the season.   NLESD, MUN postpone large events On Friday morning, the English school board suspended all extracurricular activities between schools. That includes all regional and provincial sports tournaments, heritage and science fairs, drama festivals, \"or any activity that sees multiple school populations gathered for showcase events or competition,\" according to a letter sent to parents. The letter said it was an \"unfortunate measure but a prudent step\" to prevent the potential spread of the virus. Memorial University, meanwhile, is cancelling or postponing all non-essential gatherings of 25 or more people. Classes, labs and academic activities are continuing. Hockey Canada halts all sanctioned activities 'until further notice' due to virus concernStill no confirmed COVID-19 cases in N.L. The school said no decisions have been made about convocation ceremonies in May. The events draw thousands of people to campus each year. The university is waiving the need for sick notes for employees experiencing respiratory illness less than 14 days. One private school outside the district's purview is taking things a step further. St. Bonaventure's College in St. John's is telling any students who have left the province since Feb. 28 to stay home for 14 days — as well as those whose family members have done so, even if the student did not.   A note sent to parents says students will be given material by their teachers while they work from home during the isolation period. All theatre events at Arts and Culture Centres across the province have been cancelled until further notice. Rehearsal rooms, smaller classes and art groups with people of 25 or less will still be permitted. Liberal leadership hopeful Andrew Furey, who is a orthopedic surgeon, said he is halting in-person campaigning, saying it's not responsible to shake hands and congregate when health officials are telling people to avoid large gatherings. CBC News has asked John Abbott, who is also seeking the Liberal leader role, about his campaign plans.   The province's Department of Justice says kits with protective glasses, gloves and masks are in every unit within correctional facilities.   \"An area of quarantine is being prepared at each facility should an inmate present with symptoms of COVID-19,\" reads a statement to CBC News.   Caution for St. Patrick's Day Revellers dance at Shamrock City Pub in St. John's on St. Patrick's Day 2019. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC) With St. Patrick's Day right around the corner, an associate professor of public health at Memorial University, is urging people to exercise caution while celebrating the holiday. That includes bar owners on George Street — one of the busiest stretches outside Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. \"Don't try to pack as many people into your club or bar as you normally would,\ " Donovan advised.  \"Try to allow for that distance between people.\" Cathy Donovan is an associate professor at Memorial University's school of medicine. (Paula Gale/CBC) Donovan had high praise for health-care workers and said people do need to be ready to spend two weeks in isolation, and parents should have plans if schools and daycares close. \"We have the time to plan. We have that luxury right now. So I think that's important to do.\" Cruise ship restrictions At least part of the busy cruise ship season for St. John's, and other ports in Canada, will be impacted — cruise ships with more than 500 passengers will not be allowed to dock in Canadian ports from April 2 to July 1, according to Marc Garneau, the federal transportation minister. St. John's had three ships set to dock within that time, but only one of them is now permitted to dock, as per the new rules. However, there are at least two dozen other cruise ships scheduled to dock in St. John's for the rest of July to October.   St. John's was hammered by a blizzard in January, which caused businesses to close for a week. They're staring down the barrel of another disruption now, as concerns of COVID-19 rise. (Submitted by Alick Tsui) With events being cancelled all over the place, the St. John's Board of Trade fears it's only a matter of time until business comes to a screeching halt in the Avalon region for the second time this winter, following the blizzard in January. \"It's extremely concerning, and that's why our attention right now is with our small business community,\ " said Rhonda Tulk-Lane, acting CEO of the St. John's Board of Trade. Those travelling through the St. John's International Airport will see increased signage on hand-washing and practicing good hygiene, according to the airport authority, which also said it was \"working with contracted cleaners\" to ramp up sanitization of high-traffic areas.

  As emergency and intensive care doctors around the globe work frantically to save the lives of people gravely ill with COVID-19, one of the world's foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators. \"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen in Germany, gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation. The technique was first met with ridicule before being widely adopted. At the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, many emergency departments were immediately placing COVID-19 patients with alarmingly low levels of oxygen on mechanical ventilators, a standard practice for a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But in a paper published this week in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, Gattinoni and colleagues wrote that COVID-19 appears to diverge in key ways from normal ARDS, and that the usual recommended use of ventilators at high pressure that works for standard respiratory distress cases may actually harm some COVID-19 patients. Luciano Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen, Germany, says ventilators are being misused and overused during the COVID-19 pandemic. (CBC) COVID-19 patients, like those suffering from ARDS, have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood, which leads to breathing problems. In ARDS cases, the lungs lose their elasticity. But in many cases of COVID-19, the lungs remain elastic and people are able to continue breathing for some time despite the low oxygen levels. This \"remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS,\" he writes, adding that patients with normal looking lungs but low oxygen are at risk of lung injury from the ventilators, where pressure from the air damages the thin air sacs that exchange oxygen with the blood. In Gattinoni's study, only 20 to 30 per cent of patients fully fit the severe ARDS criteria. Different types of patients requiring differentiated types of treatment are best identified by CT scan, says Gattinoni. But if CT scans are not available, doctors can indirectly gauge a patient's needs based on \"surrogate\" measurements of lung stiffness, for instance, and other factors. With the standard ARDS treatment, Gattinoni says, people are put on a ventilator sometimes too late, or too early, with the ventilator's pressure set too high, causing damage. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayINTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   Marco Garrone, an emergency doctor at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, Italy, calls Gattinoni's paper \"a game changer.\ " He said it states clearly what he and his colleagues have been experiencing in the emergency room since the pandemic exploded in northern Italy in late February. \"We started with a one-size-fits-all attitude, which didn't pay off,\" Garrone said of the practice of putting patients on ventilators right away, only to see their conditions deteriorate. \"Now we try to delay intubation as much as possible.\" Factors such as the overall health of the person before catching COVID-19, or how sick they are by the time they arrive in hospital, could also affect how well a person fares. Oxygen without force Garrone says his emergency department now begins with non-invasive ventilation — different ways of getting oxygen into patients' lungs without force, such as a mask or a nasal cannula. This helps people in the early stages of the disease to inhale enough oxygen without damaging their lungs. A staffer works on a ventilator refurbishing assembly line in Sunnyvale, Calif., late last month. Hard-hit New York has reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. (Beth Laberge/KQED via AP) Doctors in New York state and elsewhere have voiced similar concerns about putting patients on ventilators too soon and with the pressure too high. Many have begun to delay their use, after New York authorities reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. However, the head of critical care at Toronto's University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital, cautions against drawing any firm conclusions from Gattinoni's paper. Niall Ferguson, who is also site-lead at Toronto General Hospital, also says with no data to back it up, the 80 per cent rate in New York is anecdotal and seems \"extreme.\" 'It's mostly a theory' Ferguson, who calls Luciano Gattinoni \"the E.F. Hutton of intensive care — when Gattinoni talks, people listen,\" recalling a once-famous brokerage firm ad, was one of the editors of Gattinoni's paper at Intensive Care Medicine. His observations about COVID-19 \"have generated a lot of discussion in the medical community and on Twitter,\" Ferguson said. \"But I think it's important to recognize that it's mostly a theory at this point.\ " With many IC units operating near capacity, he says, doctors do not have the time to randomize patients to one treatment protocol or another in order to study the effectiveness of each. The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) published one study earlier this month on the death rate of COVID-19 patients on ventilators in the hardest-hit Italian region of Lombardy. It actually showed a relatively low death rate on ventilators, 26 per cent, but Ferguson and Garrone both dismissed its results because many patients were still on ventilators when the data was collected and may have died after. Garrone said it's when ICU units get overwhelmed that the risk of misuse of ventilators is highest. ' It's been a constant flood' \"Everyone talks about COVID as being a tsunami, but a tsunami is a wave that passes. Here in Italy, it's been a constant flood,\" he said. \"ICU physicians in Italy are well-versed with ventilation. But these patients were so overwhelming in numbers that they trickled out of the ICU into the emergency department. And that's where we began to ventilate them.\ " 3.I have had to become braver about not intubating patients. I think we should avoid intubation if at all possible. I have previously been an advocate of intubating early to ensure safe, non-emergent intubating conditions. My perspective is shifting.&mdash;@jessica_bunin Ferguson agrees that the use of ventilators becomes an issue with doctors, pulled into a crisis situation, who are less experienced with the devices. But he said the IC community of doctors he's in touch with are well aware that treatment of COVID-19 patients needs to be individualized, which was Gattinoni's main point. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?CBC IN ITALYThe lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world Laura Duggan, an anesthesiologist at the Ottawa Hospital, told the Emcrit podcast for emergency and critical care doctors that, like many ICU doctors, she looked to intubate patients with low oxygen right away, but that she's \"happy to see that pendulum swinging back a bit\" to figuring out what else can be done. \"I think there is a balance to be had between finding something that's simple and widely applicable versus trying to still personalize things for each patient,\" said Ferguson. 
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  Projected number of deaths in worst-case scenario is now around 3,000.    Overall number of cases in worst-case now projected at about 255,000.    New calculations include rate of transmission based on compliance with restrictions.    SHA to reduce maximum capacity by 1,000 hospital beds, 400 ICU beds and 400 ventilators.    The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will reduce the number of hospital beds, intensive care beds and ventilators it plans to make available based on new, lower projections for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Saskatchewan, including figures based on public compliance with restrictions. The updated COVID-19 Modelling and Health System Readiness document, updated from the first projections unveiled on April 8, shows the SHA is preparing for a worst-case scenario of about 3,000 total deaths and 60 daily intensive care admissions. \"We have flattened the curve based on what's gone on in the province: the three-legged stool around testing, contact-tracing and those severe public health restrictions,\ " said SHA CEO Scott Livingstone at a news conference on Tuesday.   \"What the model will help us do on a daily basis, weekly basis, monthly basis, is allow us to measure what's happening in the province, whether it's us reopening the health care system or the economy continuing on in phases.\ " Read the full document released Tuesday, April 28, here: Mobile users: View the document (PDF KB) (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content    The April 8 report said the authority was planning for between 3,000 to 8,300 deaths, and approximately 20 to 200 daily intensive care admissions, from COVID-19 at its peak.   The overall number of cases it is preparing for is now about 255,000. The April 8 document put that number between 153,000 and 408,000. The SHA will reduce its maximum capacity by 1,000 hospital beds, 400 ICU beds and 400 ventilators. The original modelling said the province thought it might need 963 ICU beds and 860 ventilators but did not specify how many hospital beds overall. The SHA said it will still have 83 more ventilators than it would need under the new projected scenarios.   'New normal' Despite the more positive outlook, Livingstone said what happens next is largely in the hands of the public. \"Our new normal is a normal with COVID in our population and in our province until a vaccine arrives and we need to plan that way.\" The original modelling was based on a basic reproductive rate, or R0, which is the average number of people that one person with the virus could infect,  of 2.4 to 4.0. This was based on if no interventions — such as restrictions and closures — had been taken. Regina case is lone new COVID-19 diagnosis reported Tuesday in Sask. Under the new modelling, which the SHA described as an \"improved outlook,\" the SHA is planning for an R0 of 3.12. The projection of about 3,000 deaths is based on that number. New calculations show current trend The new document also includes a new calculation: the effective reproductive number, or Rt.   According to the document, that number reflects the current trend and describes how well the various interventions are slowing the spread of COVID-19, with a lower Rt value being better. It also reflects fluctuating public compliance. On April 25, that number was pegged at 0.7, which the SHA said shows strong compliance with public health measures. The document notes that number could be lagging by 7-14 days.   \"If we don't stay flat then we know we're going to have to back off what we're doing with respect to providing more services and we will redirect those resources to COVID and we may have to start instilling more restrictions in the province again,\" said Livingstone. The new document states that the virus has reached a \"tipping point\" if the effective reproductive number reaches 1 or higher. \"Rt consistently [higher than] 1 is a major consideration in determining public health measures,\ " said the document. \"The Rt value is helpful in determining effectiveness of current interventions right now, and can be a guidepost to use when choosing to implement new measures, or loosen existing ones.\"   The Rt number will now be shared with the public weekly, the SHA said.   \"We definitely will be watching it and the goal of having the effective reproductive number is to be able to be aware and adjust as we need depending on how the loosening of the restrictions work as well as how everyone responds to them,\" said senior medical information officer Dr. Jenny Basran at Tuesday's news conference. She said there are efforts underway to develop Rt numbers for each region individually, but no specific numbers are available for the outbreak area in the far north at this time.   Basran said it is critical that the public continues to practice physical distancing and follow hand-washing guidelines.   The new modelling document does not set a date to resume elective surgeries and other medical services that are on pause. Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone says restrictions could be reinstated if the curve does not stay flat.   (CBC) Livingstone said any resumption of those services will happen in phases to balance COVID-19 care needs.   He said people have started shying away from seeking medical care from doctors and hospitals due to fear.   Data is now being used to try to assess how many people there are in the community with unmet medical needs, Livingstone added, to inform the next steps. \"The last thing we want to do is start burning through elective surgeries only to have our facilities fill up with people that have medical needs that we haven't met, or diagnostic needs that went postponed,\" said Livingstone. More details about the provincial strategy to increase testing — a measure promised to coincide with the loosening of restrictions — are also included in the new document. One of those measures is to start testing \"asymptomatic contacts\" identified through public health contact and outbreak investigations, along with outreach to populations perceived to be less likely to seek testing.   ' Saskatchewan is not two provinces' : Calls for more northern COVID-19 support continue It said testing is available at 50 sites across the province and the number of lab processing sites is being expanded from eight to 19. Tuesday's modelling document also includes Google data that indicates people in Saskatchewan have reduced their visits to grocery stores, pharmacies, transit stations and workplaces, but not as dramatically as in Canada overall. SHA's \"improved outlook\" for the province comes as leaders in northern Saskatchewan call for funding to help address an outbreak that has led to a public health order to restrict travel to and from the region.   As of Monday, there were 42 active cases reported in the far north and 10 in the north. 
  At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the Bethune Medical Development Association of Canada donated urgently needed medical supplies to Wuhan, which was at that time the epicentrre of the deadly respiratory illness.   Mere weeks later \"the tables have turned\" and that act of kindness is being returned more than a thousandfold. Dr. Lee Errett, the association's president, said the donation of personal protective equipment arrived in Toronto on Friday and delivery to Toronto area hospitals is set for this week. \"We have 50,000 pairs of gloves; 10,000 full gowns to cover all the body for those people on the direct line; we have 30,000 masks and we have 10,000 pairs of goggles,\ " Errett told CBC Toronto. Erret inside the Markham warehouse where donated personal protective equipment from China is being stored.   (Richard Agecoutay/CBC) Errett said his association had donated 10,000 N95 masks and three Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machines, plus all the equipment that goes along with them, to Wuhan. ECMO machines act as an artificial lung, pumping oxygen in to a patient's blood, giving the respiratory and cardiovascular systems a rest. The donation, he said, was enough to service 100 patients. ' People forget about us': Pharmacists concerned over lack of government-issued PPEHealth minister says test result wait times 'not acceptable' as Ontario confirms 25 new COVID-19 cases Shortly after the donation was made, Errett said the association received offers from the government of China and the Bank of China to donate the equipment for distribution in Canada. \"What we like about this contribution is it arrived quickly, and the need is right now, so it's going to make a real difference,\ " Errett said. The Bethune Medical Development Association of Canada received offers from the government of China and the Bank of China to donate personal protective equipment for distribution in Canada.   (Richard Agecoutay/CBC) Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist with the University Health Network, said the donations will take some pressure off front-line workers, but that affect will be temporary. \"The key thing here is figuring out the supply chain, not just for the next week to month, but also for the foreseeable future,\ " he said.   All of the equipment will be delivered to at least five hospitals in the GTA. Errett said while they're working to make the donations as equal as possible among the five hospitals, it will be based on what equipment is needed most, and where. All of the equipment will be delivered to at least five hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area. (Richard Agecoutay/CBC) Over the weekend, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne thanked the Bank of China for the donation, saying in a tweet: \"In the face of a global pandemic, supporting each other is not only the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.\ " Thank you for this donation. <br><br > In the face of a global pandemic, supporting each other is not only the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. <a href=\"https://t.co/rE1BZZfrCR\">https://t.co/rE1BZZfrCR</a>&mdash;@FP_Champagne

INTERACTIVE | See the latest data on COVID-19 cases in Canada.   As global reported coronavirus case numbers pass one million — including 12,549 known cases in Canada — governments are scrambling to secure critical supplies, implement tough public health measures and deal with growing job losses.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with the country's premiers on Thursday about a range of issues, including the shortage of protective gear for health-care workers, an issue that emerged again Friday amid concern over whether Canada was getting the equipment it needs from abroad, including from the United States. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage on Friday, Trudeau said his government is \"confident\ " Canada will receive the necessary equipment. He said the government would do everything it can to ensure no part of Canada goes without the supplies it needs during the pandemic. Trudeau said his government has been working \"very closely\" with the Americans to make clear that essential supplies, products and services flow both ways between Canada and the United States every day, highlighting the example of nurses from Windsor, Ont., who travel to Detroit to work.   \"These are things that Americans rely on and it would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back-and-forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.\" WATCH | Trudeau talks about controversy around cross-border flow of critical supplies: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacts to the news that the Trump administration has ordered a major manufacturer 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 1:43 Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday that the Canadian-American relationship is very important. She said during a pandemic, \"all relationships\" face challenges and the cross-border one is no exception. Canada continues to work with 3M and its U.S. partners, Freeland said, adding that the government is working with a range of suppliers around the world. \"We are totally seized of this issue,\ " Freeland said when asked about the need to get medical workers critical supplies.   WATCH |  Freeland reacts to Trump administration's 3M order:   Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says the government will \"pull out all the stops\" in response to the Trump administration's decision to order 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 3:03 When asked about the U.S. blocking medical exports, Freeland said the Canadian government is prepared to do \"whatever it takes\" to defend the national interest. The prime minister said the government has signed a deal with Amazon Canada to use its distribution network to send medical supplies to meet provincial needs. Ontario releases coronavirus projections Faced with rising case numbers and tighter restrictions, there have been some calls for more information from governments about what is expected and what information is driving decisions. Trudeau has said that such national modelling is coming \"soon,\" but that the federal government requires more data from provincial and territorial governments — a subject he discussed with premiers during his more than two-hour first ministers' conference call. WATCH | Public Health Ontario head projects between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths over pandemic's full course:   The best case scenario for the number of COVID-19 related deaths in Ontario is 3,000-15,000 over the full course of the pandemic, says Dr. Peter Donnelly, the CEO of Public Health Ontario. 2:56 Ontario released its provincial projection and modelling information on Friday, with Premier Doug Ford saying that he wants the province's residents to know \"what I know.\ " The modelling projects the coronavirus crisis could last 18 months to two years and kill 3,000 to 15,000 people, even with public health measures in place. \"Had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\" said Public Health Ontario CEO Peter Donnelly, referencing the province's physical distancing and other measures. \"Thankfully, that is not the position we are in.\"   CBC EXPLAINS |  What you need to know about the new COVID-19 emergency wage subsidy 5 myths about preventing, detecting COVID-19   Donnelly said he understands these figures may seem \"scary, intimidating\" and to many, \"unlikely.\ " But, he said, every year about 1,350 people die from normal seasonal flu. In a bad year, 1,500 people die. \"When you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and you remember we have no vaccine, and we have no specific treatment …  then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible.\" A health-care worker wearing protective gear walks in front of a COVID-19 assessment centre at the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto on Friday. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press ) On Friday, Ford implored Ontarians to do their part to help ease the burden on the province's hospitals and announced more shutdowns — including some construction projects. Given the projections released today, it was the right thing to do, he said. \"Everyone has had to pay a price in this war,\ " he said. \"Daily life has ground to a halt.\" Speaking ahead of the release of the Ontario figures, Trudeau said again that \"how we get through this depends on you,\" and that Canadians are \"looking to do the right thing.\ " Trudeau has reiterated daily the need to practise physical distancing, stay at home whenever possible and practise proper hand hygiene.

Trudeau also said Friday that the Canadian Armed Forces will assist in northern Quebec to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in isolated communities, at the provincial government's request. The Rangers, which are part of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve and provide a Canadian Armed Forces presence in northern and isolated communities, will help set up tents and other medical equipment, as required by the communities. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says the situation is evolving daily but that the risk to Canadians from COVID-19 is \"considered high.\" Here's a look at what's happening in Canada, the U.S. and around the world Friday. Here's a look at what's happening in the provinces and territories As of midnight ET on Friday, Canada has 12,549 confirmed and presumptive cases, with 219 deaths. The provinces and territories that list information about recovered cases have reported 2,296 cases as resolved or recovered. There have also been two reported COVID-19-related deaths of Canadians abroad  — one in Japan and one in Brazil.   Public health officials caution that reported case numbers don't provide a complete picture of the scale of the outbreak as that data doesn't capture people who haven't been tested and cases that are still under investigation. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has urged people nationwide to practise physical distancing and behave as though there is COVID-19 in their community, even if there is no known case.    To see how things break down in your province, visit the CBC's COVID-19 case tracker.

Here's a look at what's happening in hard-hit Italy, Spain and parts of Europe From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 5:30 p.m. ET Europe's three worst-hit countries — Italy, Spain and France — surpassed 30,000 dead, or over half of the global toll. Spain is closing Friday a black week, with its death toll for the new coronavirus nearing 11,000. More than half of those occurred during the past seven days. There are also more infections than any other country in Europe. The bottleneck in Spanish labs conducting the tests has led to relatively low levels of testing in Spain compared to other European countries, authorities have acknowledged. But even with statistics that are believed to be conservative in showing the extent of the epidemic, Spain on Friday neared 118,000 cases, second only to the United States. Official Health Ministry data showed that 7,472 of those infections had been in the past 24 hours.  Spain also registered 932 new deaths, 18 less than its daily record of 950 the day before.

Germany's low death rate from coronavirus has drawn international attention. Experts say the difference compared to other countries is partly due to mass testing and well-equipped hospitals, but they caution that the number of deaths is likely to rise.

Cuba was one of 24 countries in the region meant to receive the donations announced March 21 by a foundation started by China's richest person, Jack Ma, but officials say the cargo carrier of Colombia-based Avianca Airlines declined to fly the aid to Cuba because its major shareholder is a U.S.-based company subject to the trade embargo on Cuba. The embargo has exceptions for food and medical aid, but companies are often afraid to carry out related financing or transportation due to the risk of fines or prosecution. Human-rights groups have been calling for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba and Iran during the pandemic in order to permit the flow of more aid. The Trump administration has argued only the countries' governments would benefit from the sanctions relief. 
  Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The province currently has 270 ventilators, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health.  An additional 16 have been ordered, Health Minister Cameron Friesen said Wednesday. Manitoba's population was roughly 1.38 million in the first quarter of 2020, according to Statistics Canada. That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive. The total does not include ventilators in operating rooms, which are a different type of machine not preferred for critical care or cardiac patients, said Lanette Siraugsa, chief nursing officer for Shared Health, on Saturday. Those machines could be used to treat COVID-19 patients in \"certain situations,\ " she said, but aren't the preferred method. Based on a CBC breakdown of reported ventilators and provincial populations across the country, Manitoba ranks roughly in the middle. Ontario, with a capacity of roughly 12.3 ventilators to 100,000 people, is near the bottom, while Quebec leads the country, with an anticipated capacity of roughly 35.1 ventilators per 100,000 people. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines. They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.   (CBC News) But countries around the world are facing shortages of the machines as the explosion of cases overwhelms health-care systems. In the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, doctors have been forced to decide which patients get priority access, and which do not. That's the scenario Canada is bracing for — and scrambling to prevent — by finding more machines. Prevention also includes flattening the curve through public health measures like social distancing, said Dr. Atul Kapur, an emergency physician in Ottawa and co-chair of the public affairs committee of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. \"Right now, we don't have anywhere close to the capacity or the number of ventilators for the demand that we're anticipating, by looking at what other countries [experience],\" Kapur said. When it comes to ventilators per capita, Ontario's near the bottom \"This is unprecedented. The estimates that we have had so far are just not holding up to the demand that COVID is causing,\" he continued. \"And even now, it's a bit difficult, because we don't know how bad it's going to get.\ " Manitoba preparing 'for the worst case': Top doctor Most Canadian hospitals operate near 100 per cent capacity \"at the best of times,\ " Kapur said. That means they don't have the \"buffer\" to handle a sudden surge in demand — and neither did many other countries. \"That's the problem,\ " Kapur said. \"We're fighting with every other country to increase our numbers.\" Canada's readiness is a \"mixed picture,\ " Kapur said. The country is orders of magnitude away from what it would need for its worst-case scenario. \"Even the best case scenario ... Right now, we don't have the capacity to deal with what that would be,\" Kapur said. \"But hopefully we have time, in a matter of weeks, to build that up.\" Health minister asks Manitoba businesses to provide products, supplies for hospitals during pandemic It's difficult to pinpoint an ideal number of ventilators for Manitoba because the path of the virus in this province could change based on multiple variables, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. \"There's a large variability in the modelling numbers that we have. And so we're looking to prepare not only for the expected case but we're looking to prepare for the worst case,\ " Roussin said at a daily news briefing Thursday. WATCH | Experts say Canada could come up against ventilator shortage in weeks Canada could face a shortage of ventilators within a few weeks if cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. 2:00 \"I don't have a specific number that I could tell you. But we are putting things in place to prepare for worst case scenarios, and so ventilators, critical care beds, those type of things, are part of that plan,\ " Roussin said. The province has called on private businesses to donate ventilators and other supplies. On Friday, Friesen said public health officials have also had talks with manufacturers to see if they could make more of the machines, or other needed equipment. There's also nuance behind the numbers, said Dr. Kelly MacDonald, the head of the section of infectious disease in the department of internal medicine for the University of Manitoba and the WRHA. Respiratory therapists are needed to run the machines. Unions have already raised concerns about staffing levels at Winnipeg hospitals. Respiratory care at HSC overburdened, understaffed even before COVID-19, unions say Health-care experts are also working to find alternatives. Kapur noted some doctors are working on ways to rig ventilators to help two or three patients at a time, instead of just one, for example. \"I think that providing good health care and survival has a lot more to do with a variety of other things, other than just the machines,\ " MacDonald said. Ability to 'change our destiny' in Manitoba: emerging virus expert One of the traits of a COVID-19 outbreak that makes it so hard on health-care systems is a pattern of sickening patients all at once, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. Across the world, health-care systems have seen a sudden influx of very sick patients all at once, rather than staggered, like with influenza, he said.   He hopes that Manitoba has had enough warning to take action and flatten the curve, so that impact won't be as overwhelming here. He praised Manitoba's actions so far on implementing physical distancing measures, and said Manitobans have done a good job of responding to the call so far. \"It's not necessarily just one variable where the virus hits and then you need all the ventilators,\ " Kindrachuk said. \"We still have the ability right now to kind of change our destiny a little bit with what's going to happen in Winnipeg.\ " It's critical for Manitobans to act responsibly now to mitigate some of the pressure that will be placed on the health-care system, MacDonald said. \"Ultimately, how this goes is going to be as much an issue of how we do as a society, as it will be an issue of how people do at hospitals.\ "
  There are now 698 deaths linked to COVID-19 infection in Ontario, according to the latest data collected by CBC News. The provincial government is reporting 622 deaths, though those numbers lag behind those provided by local health units. At a news conference Tuesday, Premier Doug Ford said the first thing he does in the morning each day is ask for the updated death toll. \"It hits you hard in the heart, believe me,\" he said. The province announced Tuesday that 859 people have now been hospitalized with COVID-19, which is up from 802 on Monday.  The number of patients in ICU has risen slightly to 250 from 247, while one more person is now on a ventilator, with 194 of those cases total. COVID-19 cases in Ontario have reached 11,735, as the province announced 551 new cases Tuesday morning. The province also says 5,806 people have recovered. Those numbers provide a snapshot of the situation in Ontario as of April 20. The province says it has now completed 174,170 tests for the virus, with 9,330 of those happening on Monday. According to the latest figures, 5,546 tests are currently under evaluation. New projections Previous modelling from the province showed that by the start of this week, under the \"best case scenario,\" more than 1,200 people confirmed to have COVID-19 would be in intensive care units. But new modelling projections released Monday suggest there are fewer hospitalizations and patients in intensive care than predicted. The province is now working on what Premier Doug Ford calls \"a framework for a gradual, measured and safe reopening of our province based on the data we are seeing today.\" Mike Crawley, who covers Queen's Park for CBC News, has more on what that could look like here.   The province's Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams told reporters Tuesday that Ontario's numbers seem to be on a bit of a \"plateau,\" and now officials want to see them drop.   \"We'd like to see those community-based numbers coming down extensively,\ " he said, later adding that the province would want to see daily case numbers in the 200 range, \"if not lower,\" for physical distancing measures to begin to ease. \"When we're dealing with daily numbers of over 500, we're not there yet.\ " Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams says the province has 'gained a reprieve' in acute care and ICU numbers, and now is trying to prioritize long-term care and congregate settings. (The Canadian Press) At Tuesday's news conference, Ford said he is very confident that with the support of the province's industries, \"we're going to have the economy moving forward and going on all cylinders,\ " but added it \"won't happen overnight.\ " He cautioned that all Ontarians will need to be cautious, even if people are anxious to get back to work. \"We're going to have this province booming once again,\ " Ford said. Support for seniors Ford said the province is partnering with the Ontario Community Support Association and providing $11 million for meals on wheels and other support programs to get food and medications to seniors and people with disabilities during the pandemic. The premier also said payments from the province's Guaranteed Annual Income System are being delivered this week, and Ontario is doubling payments for 194,000 low-income seniors across the province. \"This will provide much-needed financial support for the seniors who need it most,\ " he said.

According to the figures the province released Tuesday, 121 outbreaks have been reported in long-term care homes, which marks an increase of seven from Monday's report.   Some homes are dealing with large-scale outbreaks, like Seven Oaks in Scarborough, where 108 of the home's 249 residents have tested positive and 29 have died. Twenty-four staff members have also tested positive.   Forest Heights Revera in Kitchener also has 103 positive resident cases, 41 staff cases, and 12 deaths. Ontario Premier Doug Ford answers questions during the daily briefing at Queen's Park in Toronto on April 7. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) In Pickering, Orchard Villa Retirement residence is now reporting 31 deaths among its long-term care residents, with 98 resident cases and 24 staff cases of the virus. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our residents and we extend our sincere condolences to their family and friends,\" said acting executive director April Beckett in a statement. Ford told reporters Tuesday that changes do need to be made within the province's long-term care system. \"I'm the person who's going to be held accountable no matter which way this goes,\ " he said. Williams said the way the virus is spreading in long-term care homes compared to the way it's spreading in the community seems like two separate events. Though community spread is showing signs of peaking, that hasn't yet happened in long-term care, he said. Courts on hold for 3 more months Criminal and civil jury trials in Ontario will be on hold at least an additional three months in light of the ongoing pandemic. The Ontario Superior Court temporarily halted in-person operations in mid-March due to rising concerns over the novel coronavirus, with all criminal and civil matters suspended or adjourned until June. In a notice issued this week, Chief Justice Geoffrey B. Morawetz now says the court will not resume jury selection and jury trials until September at the earliest. Morawetz says the court will monitor the situation and give further direction next month. 
  Canada's hospitals and health officials are looking at ways to boost the number of available ventilators to prepare for a deluge of very sick COVID-19 patients amid projections that they could run out of such life-saving equipment within weeks. While most people who get COVID-19 only face mild symptoms, the sickest end up in intensive care units and must be attached to ventilators in order to survive and recover. A new study shows Canada's most populated province, Ontario, could run out of ventilators quickly if the trajectory of the pandemic is similar to that in Italy. There, the coronavirus epidemic has already overwhelmed the health-care system, forcing doctors to make hard choices about which patients get access to life-saving resources such as intensive care beds and ventilators. Ontario has implemented school and restaurant closures and is encouraging social distancing among residents in an effort to stop that from happening, notes Beate Sander, a scientist who has been modelling the potential impact of the pandemic on the province's health-care system. \"What our modelling is showing is that if we cannot keep these interventions in place ...  we're going to run out of capacity really, really quickly — likely in the next two weeks, Sander said.   Sander is a University Health Network Scientist and an associate professor at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. She and her colleagues looked at a variety scenarios that estimated when the hospital system would run out of resources without an increase in ventilators and ICU beds. The study was published online by the researchers Thursday, but has not yet been peer-reviewed. It found that even under a \"conservative\" scenario where cases increase only 7.5 per cent per day, ventilators would run out after a month. That's because very sick patients tend to spend one to three weeks in hospital, Sander said.  \"They're piling up.\" COVID-19: What you need to knowVentilator manufacturer says Canada should have stockpiled machines after SARS In total, Ontario has 2,000 ICU beds and 1,300 ventilators, but most are in use. Sander suggests 25 per cent be freed up for COVID-19 patients by cancelling elective surgeries and discharging patients. She said her main concern now is that Ontario keep up its social distancing measures and that \"we absolutely do the planning and ramp up our capacity of ventilators and ICU beds. It has to happen.\" Creative solutions to acquire more ventilator capacity Meanwhile, hospitals are looking at creative solutions. Dr. Alain Gauthier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital, has rigged up ventilators to be able to ventilate two patients at once instead of one. He did that by following YouTube videos created by two Detroit doctors in 2006. \"At one point we may not have other options,\ " Dr. Gauthier told CBC News. \"The option could be well , we let people die or we give that a chance.\" Watch: Does Canada have enough ventilators? Fearing a potential shortage of ventilators, one rural Canadian doctor has rigged up a fix. 2:04 The hospital currently has four new ventilators and four in reserve that can't be repaired.   Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said Thursday that the federal government hasn't received any requests for ventilators from provincial health authorities, but has been acquiring some for its stockpile. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said Canada could do what the U.S. and Italy are doing: getting military forces to help with the production of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Ontario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half : study Ontario's health minister, Christine Elliott, has assured the public there are enough ventilators for now — and 300 more have been ordered. \"We've procured 300 more ventilators to add to the 210 we currently have in surplus,\" said Elliott's spokesperson, Hayley Chazan. \"We continue to work on procuring additional ventilators.\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Canadian automotive supplier and manufacturer Magna International has also committed to help with the production of ventilators. \"We can't rely on importing these ventilators,\ " he was quoted by Reuters as saying. Perth doctor rigs up solution to feared ventilator shortageGovernment expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister One U.S. company that manufacturers ventilators told CBC News earlier this week that it has stopped all international shipments, including those to Canada, due to large orders from U.S. emergency organizations. Supply is also being squeezed by large orders in Europe. Germany has ordered 10,000 new ventilators and Italy has ordered 5,000, NBC News reported.

Steven Soderbergh's 2011 thriller Contagion opens with a horrifying montage that highlights the myriad social conduits through which a pandemic can spread. From the opening cough in a busy airport lounge, the viewer is bombarded with unnerving shots of crowded subways, bustling markets and workplaces, of people touching infected doorknobs, credit cards, table trays and each other. Given the fact that the fictional virus in the film and COVID-19 both originated in Asia and are easily transmitted through touch, it is not surprising that Contagion has been one of the top trending movies on both Amazon and iTunes since January. But watching Soderbergh's premonitions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, what's most striking about the story isn't the meticulous details through which the film catalogues the viral outbreak itself, but the spread of something even more dangerous. As the film's woefully appropriate tagline goes: \"Nothing spreads like fear.\ " In a 1993 paper published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science, psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson introduced the term \"emotional contagion\" to describe the \"tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person's and, consequently, to converge emotionally.\ " Put another way, emotional contagion is the socially-viral phenomenon through which people's emotions and related behaviours can trigger similar emotions and behaviours in others. Grocery stores across Canada have been flooded in recent days by shoppers emptying store shelves as they stock up on everything from food and medicines to hand sanitizer and toilet paper. (Jesse Johnston/CBC News) Contagion is foreboding because it portrays a world decimated not only by a virus, but also by a whole set of social, emotional, psychological and economic ills that come along with it — erratic market fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, fake news, medical supply hoarding, rampant xenophobia, and people putting personal interests over the sweeping public health initiatives required to \"flatten the curve\" of a disease. While Contagion is fiction, these same factors can be seen in society right now, and they play a vital role in how people, communities and governments are able to effectively respond to an outbreak and manage its spread in the real world. AnalysisCOVID-19 isn't just testing governments, it's testing citizensAnalysisOttawa can't afford any more mixed messages on COVID-19 As the Canadian Psychological Association points out, speculation and misinformation incubate in these kinds of crisis scenarios. On the one hand, some people are under-responding to the threat of COVID-19 — in assuming the dangers are exaggerated, they may practice lazy hygiene, ignore social-distancing advice, or keep coming to work even if they're sick. Such behaviours, which are personified by President Trump's repeated comparison of coronavirus to the common flu, can be explained through the phenomena of \"psychic numbing,\" where a person's ability to care or take action is paralyzed by their inability to comprehend the scale of the problem. On the other hand, some are over-responding to the risks — cultivating intense anxieties about potential infection that manifest as hysterical buying, panicked racism, and other erratic behaviours that have the effect of spreading fear across entire communities. The crisis generates high levels of insecurity, which in turn drives people to seek out ways of resolving that uncertainty and reducing their anxiety by getting information about the threat. Grocery stores struggling to keep up as shoppers clear shelves but say there's no lack of supplyWhen you can't afford to hoard, what happens then? In this context, the torrent of fake news and misinformation — what John Naughton, writing in The Guardian, terms the \"infodemic\ " — overwhelms people's earnest attempts to make sense of a confusing situation with a combination of conflicting rumours, bad science, implicit censorship, and malicious actors manipulating social media platforms for economic gain. Toilet paper, bottled water and canned foods are among the items flying of shelves amid concerns about COVID-19. (Bobby Hristova/CBC) There's a scene midway through Contagion that best illustrates the aggravating effects of such emotional contagion on the larger pandemic event. Responding to the ensuing panic stirred up in the movie by the spread of bioweapon fables, homeopathic cures and doomsday prepping, the fictional head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (played by Laurence Fishburne) calmly reminds the viewer that \"... in order to become sick, you have to first come in contact with a sick person or something that they touched. In order to get scared, all you have to do is to come in contact with a rumour, or the television, or the internet.\ " This is the alarming thing about the transmission of fear. It infects people's feelings and actions, causing them to behave in ways that often run against their own interests, not to mention their larger obligations to public health and social life. If you act frightened or engage in the frenzied stockpiling of toilet paper, then others will react with fear as well. At the same time, your cache of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer actively prevent others in their community from getting access to them, which can worsen the spread. Unfounded fears of shortages amid an outbreak of COVID-19 have Canadians buying up supplies. 2:06 In Canada, as in Soderbergh's film, the current call for social distancing marks the moment when society is most at risk for exposure to emotional as well as biological contagion. All of us have a responsibility to our loved ones and communities to respond to this pandemic in sensible and unselfish ways. How Canadians are helping Canadians make it through the COVID-19 pandemic For politicians and business leaders, this means finding ways to avoid forcing vulnerable workers to choose between their jobs and their health. It means ensuring minimum-wage, customer-facing workers in the service industry are granted the same allowances to self-quarantine as those with the means, wealth and flexibility to work remotely. For many of us, this collective responsibility means thinking less about \"what I can do to keep myself safe,\" and more about \"what steps I can take to help ensure the safety of others.\ " We should not fear the catastrophic, but rather, in the words of poet and activist Anne Boyer, remind yourself that \"fear educates our care for each other.\"   This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

  Researchers at the University of Guelph have developed a system to help track the spread of infectious diseases using Twitter, a framework they say has the potential to identify outbreaks faster than official monitoring agencies. The study, which tracked global outbreaks of avian flu, may be the first of its kind to use the social network as an early warning system for tracking diseases. The team of veterinary and computer science researchers used artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze over 200,000 tweets for mentions of avian flu, and then sorted that data to help reveal clues about where the disease is spreading. They say they detected 75 per cent of real-world outbreaks of avian flu in poultry between between July 2017 and November 2018.     \"Our web robot monitors the Internet 24/7,\" said Shayan Sharif, a professor and associate dean at the Ontario Veterinary College. \"We then go back to those tweets, we try to annotate them essentially to identify a background noise from the actual data that can be utilized in order to train the machine.\" Potential use against coronavirus   They're now turning their attention to COVID-19 as well.    \"In the context of coronavirus, people may talk about their signs and symptoms such as fevers, aching all over their body, or having shortness of breath,\ " he said. \"We'd then try and utilize those types of keywords in order to train our machine.\ " Sharif said the framework has been able to identify potential avian flu outbreaks before conventional monitoring systems, something he hopes could be of help monitoring COVID-19  and other human pathogens.   He said, the immediacy of Twitter data means monitors can glean information on a potential outbreak without having to wait for results from distant laboratories.   \"There's is a huge gap between the time that a case is detected and the time that the case is confirmed, for example, coronavirus or avian influenza,\ " he said.  \"People start talking about their own signs and symptoms well ahead of that.\ " The research was published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports in December. The paper's lead author, computer science professor Rozita Dara, says they hope the system can be used to predict outbreaks earlier \"as a supplemental source of surveillance.\"
  A technology originally conceived to remotely monitor the heart rates of premature babies has been transformed into a potential way to scan huge groups for illnesses like COVID-19. A Canadian company is adapting the technology for drones and closed-circuit video cameras. But being able to scan people from up to 50 metres away and tell if they're sick, potentially without them knowing, raises some big privacy concerns.   The technology connects video cameras, including those equipped with thermal-imaging systems, to a computer program with learning algorithms.   The system can monitor temperature, heart and respiratory rate, and tell when someone is sneezing or coughing. The computer can determine if someone has a respiratory illness or infectious disease, according to Javeen Chahl, a professor of engineering at the University of South Australia. Chahl headed up the research developing the system.   Equipping drones with this technology will allow the computer system to scan large groups to determine if they're sick.   (Draganfly Inc.) The more video the program has of people sick with a particular disease, the better it is at detecting signs of that illness. To get more footage of people with COVID-19, a pilot project using the system is expected to be run in the New York City area in the coming weeks.   The technology is attracting attention in Canada, where some airports have expressed an interest, according to Canadian drone manufacturer Draganfly Inc.     Chahl has partnered with Draganfly to expand the use of his research. The company wants to sell the technology to governments, along with medical and commercial customers.   Draganfly has a manufacturing plant in Saskatoon and offices in Vancouver and the U.S.  Much of its business has come from selling drones to first responders. Cameron Chell is the CEO of Draganfly Inc. (Draganfly Inc.) Both Chahl and Draganfly hope this technology will provide a quick way to screen for COVID-19 and help detect the spread of other diseases. \"This technology can be used … even as a global early-warning system,\" said Cameron Chell, the CEO of Draganfly Inc.  \"It's really designed to get stats on what's actually happening, so the real decisions can be made and policy can be set.\ " Chell said the cost of the pandemic has already been too high with thousands of deaths worldwide and billions of dollars in economic loss. He said being able to get timely information on how many people are sick and where they are located are ways to help governments and health authorities stop the spread of infectious diseases.   Chell plans to adapt the computer system to work with security cameras as well. (CBC) But developing this kind of technology, especially during an emergency, is a concern for David Fraser, a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper in Halifax. Fraser said sometimes companies and governments rush to develop technologies or procedures during a crisis without full consideration of public privacy or security.   He said proper checks and balances need to be put in place before any kind of new scanning technology is used. \"To widely deploy a technology to collect baseline health information about a population, and about its individuals who are part of that population, that needs to be justified. It needs to be justifiable and that needs to be a societal conversation,\" said Fraser.    \"It has generally been my experience that the people who make the tools, or deploy the tools, or sell the tools are not the ones in a good position to evaluate the privacy impact of those tools.\ "    David Fraser is a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper. (McInnes Cooper) Chell understands those privacy concerns. He said the system is not designed to single out individuals, but to monitor the health of a population. However, that capability might not be far away.   Chell likens the rise of this kind of medical scanning technology to the widespread use of metal detectors and body scanners at airports after 9/11. \"Health protection is as important as firearms protection,\" said Chell.  \"I think this is part of the new reality and we're going to have to learn how to be OK with it.\ " A health-care worker puts on a pair of gloves at a COVID-19 testing area in Burnaby, B.C., earlier this month. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press) Once the computer scans enough people with COVID-19, it could be used to screen individuals before they come into a hospital or health-care centre, said Chahl.   The system is not meant to replace traditional diagnostic tests, but can provide an additional screening method.   The computer could identify people with symptoms so they can be isolated as soon as they enter a facility. \"If you reduce … essential services personnel to half as much risk then they might be able to keep operating for twice as long before they contract the virus, for example. So it's a great benefit to filter and screen,\" said Chahl.    Thomas Trappenberg is a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University who researches machine learning.   (Thomas Trappenberg) Equipping a drone with the system would also be helpful, according to Chahl. He said if an organization was involved in a relief effort in an area hard hit by an infectious disease, a drone could get an idea of the health of the population without endangering anyone. But that's not yet possible.   No one is sure how much information would have to be fed into the system before it could correctly identify one illness from another.    It is possible to use computer programs to tell when a person is sick.  However, it's tricky trying to teach a machine how to identify a specific illness, according to Thomas Trappenberg, a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University. Trappenberg studies machine learning, the mechanism Chahl's computer program uses to identify sickness. \"They need a lot of data,\" said Trappenberg. \"How many data we have to feed them is also very hard to predict. \"I think this is what the company is trying to do right now, trying to get more images, and it is a little bit stabbing in the dark. But it's well worth probably trying it.\ " Draganfly has made a name for itself by selling its products to first responders in the United States.   (Draganfly Inc.) There are other problems that will have to be solved before the technology can be effective, according to Sageev Oore, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, also at Dalhousie.   \"On real streets with real people in real weather conditions, with real movement and real camera lenses that might get a little piece of dirt on them, all of those things add, cumulatively, a lot of challenge,\" said Oore.    Even so, Oore thinks the research is worth doing.   Chahl said more needs to be done before the system reaches its full potential.   Still the technology has been used to detect whether people were alive under debris, by comparing the way debris shifted in relation to a person's breathing frequency. It also succeeded at measuring the heart rate of premature babies in incubators.    Trying to figure out the heart rates of babies without the use of electrodes or other equipment is how the project started back in 2015.   Fraser said even with those successes, it's important the determinations the computer makes about someone's health are confirmed by medical testing. He applauds people who want to use their skills to try to help society cope with this pandemic, but he said people still need to be cautious.    MORE TOP STORIES  Some N.S. nursing homes end window visits amid COVID-19 concernsMedical marathon: Doctors deal with their own stress so they can fight COVID-19CBRM's struggle with virtual council meetings may be overPremier rolls out emergency plan to deal with COVID-19 at NorthwoodUnion asked to find more workers to help at Northwood  
 Dentists' offices have been closed for all but dire emergencies during the coronavirus pandemic. But chipped teeth, toothaches and other dental issues don't respect the shutdown. So what happens then? CBC's Sonali Karnick spoke with Dr. Guy Lafrance, president of Quebec's order of dentists, on Saturday's All In A Weekend. This interview has been edited for length. How should people get in touch with their dentist? First of all, we do it by phone. If the clinic does not answer the phone, just leave a message on the answering machine.  They should check messages regularly, so the dentist will phone you and try to figure out if it's a real emergency. What counts as a real emergency? Severe pain. Pain that cannot be controlled with the painkiller that you buy off the shelf at the drugstore. Infection, redness, swelling, prolonged bleeding, uncontrolled bleeding. Oral trauma — at this time of the year, this is quite frequent because the kids are starting to bicycle, because it's springtime. So sometimes they fall, and then maybe they have a helmet, but they can still injure their teeth. So this is an emergency that needs to be taken care of right away. Dr. Guy Lafrance, president of Quebec's order of dentists, says any dental issue should begin with a call to your dentist. (Ordre des dentistes du Québec) What if you have a COVID-19 infection? We'll ask you a couple of questions — the regular questions: if you have a cough, a fever or if you've made contact with  people with the COVID-19 virus. Then, over the phone, we will try to figure out if you can be treated with a prescription. That's the best situation. If your situation can be treated with a prescription, you can arrange for your prescription over the phone with the pharmacy. Maybe the pharmacist will be able to deliver the medication to your place. But some people have the COVID-19 virus, and they do have a dental emergency. It doesn't happen that frequently, but it could happen. That's why the government has designated centres, mostly hospitals, that can take care of those people with the virus right now. What if your clinic is in a building that has been closed? You should be able to phone them. They may tell you to go somewhere else — a colleague, another clinic in your neighbourhood. What can someone do if they need emergency care and can't reach their regular dentist? Don't go to the hospital. They're so busy right now.  Go to the website of the Ordre des dentistes du Québec, maboucheensante.com, and we have a list of clinics all over the province that are open. What if you feel like you have a cavity? If the cavity is not sensitive, just make sure you brush well and floss well. For the moment, just try to avoid sweet things and acidic food or liquids, because they may wake up the pain. Suppose the tooth is sensitive, you can use some sensitive toothpaste. But don't forget, after using sensitive toothpaste, you don't brush and you don't eat for half an hour, because sensitive toothpaste makes a kind of layer of protection over your tooth — a really, really, really thin layer. During the day, if the tooth is sensitive, you can rub it with the sensitive toothpaste. It can help, too. What about a broken tooth, or dental work that's coming out, such as a filling or a bridge? First things first : phone your dentist, and discuss it with your dentist. Suppose you have a broken tooth, and it's rubbing on your tongue or on your cheek. You can go to a drugstore and buy orthodontic wax. This wax is sticky, and it will stick on your piece of tooth that is broken and might be sharp. But phone your dentist and discuss with your dentist, and you will try to figure it out over the phone. Maybe you can send a picture of your tooth over the phone.   What kind of advice do you have for people to take care of their dental health so that they don't end up needing emergency care? The basics: just brushing and flossing well all the time. Sometimes when people are home during the day, and they do not have their regular routine, they don't brush as regularly as they once did. Try to keep your routine for dental health. It will help, definitely. 
  As emergency and intensive care doctors around the globe work frantically to save the lives of people gravely ill with COVID-19, one of the world's foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators. \"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen in Germany, gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation. The technique was first met with ridicule before being widely adopted. At the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, many emergency departments were immediately placing COVID-19 patients with alarmingly low levels of oxygen on mechanical ventilators, a standard practice for a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But in a paper published this week in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, Gattinoni and colleagues wrote that COVID-19 appears to diverge in key ways from normal ARDS, and that the usual recommended use of ventilators at high pressure that works for standard respiratory distress cases may actually harm some COVID-19 patients. Luciano Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen, Germany, says ventilators are being misused and overused during the COVID-19 pandemic. (CBC) COVID-19 patients, like those suffering from ARDS, have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood, which leads to breathing problems. In ARDS cases, the lungs lose their elasticity. But in many cases of COVID-19, the lungs remain elastic and people are able to continue breathing for some time despite the low oxygen levels. This \"remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS,\" he writes, adding that patients with normal looking lungs but low oxygen are at risk of lung injury from the ventilators, where pressure from the air damages the thin air sacs that exchange oxygen with the blood. In Gattinoni's study, only 20 to 30 per cent of patients fully fit the severe ARDS criteria. Different types of patients requiring differentiated types of treatment are best identified by CT scan, says Gattinoni. But if CT scans are not available, doctors can indirectly gauge a patient's needs based on \"surrogate\" measurements of lung stiffness, for instance, and other factors. With the standard ARDS treatment, Gattinoni says, people are put on a ventilator sometimes too late, or too early, with the ventilator's pressure set too high, causing damage. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayINTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   Marco Garrone, an emergency doctor at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, Italy, calls Gattinoni's paper \"a game changer.\ " He said it states clearly what he and his colleagues have been experiencing in the emergency room since the pandemic exploded in northern Italy in late February. \"We started with a one-size-fits-all attitude, which didn't pay off,\" Garrone said of the practice of putting patients on ventilators right away, only to see their conditions deteriorate. \"Now we try to delay intubation as much as possible.\" Factors such as the overall health of the person before catching COVID-19, or how sick they are by the time they arrive in hospital, could also affect how well a person fares. Oxygen without force Garrone says his emergency department now begins with non-invasive ventilation — different ways of getting oxygen into patients' lungs without force, such as a mask or a nasal cannula. This helps people in the early stages of the disease to inhale enough oxygen without damaging their lungs. A staffer works on a ventilator refurbishing assembly line in Sunnyvale, Calif., late last month. Hard-hit New York has reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. (Beth Laberge/KQED via AP) Doctors in New York state and elsewhere have voiced similar concerns about putting patients on ventilators too soon and with the pressure too high. Many have begun to delay their use, after New York authorities reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. However, the head of critical care at Toronto's University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital, cautions against drawing any firm conclusions from Gattinoni's paper. Niall Ferguson, who is also site-lead at Toronto General Hospital, also says with no data to back it up, the 80 per cent rate in New York is anecdotal and seems \"extreme.\" 'It's mostly a theory' Ferguson, who calls Luciano Gattinoni \"the E.F. Hutton of intensive care — when Gattinoni talks, people listen,\" recalling a once-famous brokerage firm ad, was one of the editors of Gattinoni's paper at Intensive Care Medicine. His observations about COVID-19 \"have generated a lot of discussion in the medical community and on Twitter,\" Ferguson said. \"But I think it's important to recognize that it's mostly a theory at this point.\ " With many IC units operating near capacity, he says, doctors do not have the time to randomize patients to one treatment protocol or another in order to study the effectiveness of each. The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) published one study earlier this month on the death rate of COVID-19 patients on ventilators in the hardest-hit Italian region of Lombardy. It actually showed a relatively low death rate on ventilators, 26 per cent, but Ferguson and Garrone both dismissed its results because many patients were still on ventilators when the data was collected and may have died after. Garrone said it's when ICU units get overwhelmed that the risk of misuse of ventilators is highest. ' It's been a constant flood' \"Everyone talks about COVID as being a tsunami, but a tsunami is a wave that passes. Here in Italy, it's been a constant flood,\" he said. \"ICU physicians in Italy are well-versed with ventilation. But these patients were so overwhelming in numbers that they trickled out of the ICU into the emergency department. And that's where we began to ventilate them.\ " 3.I have had to become braver about not intubating patients. I think we should avoid intubation if at all possible. I have previously been an advocate of intubating early to ensure safe, non-emergent intubating conditions. My perspective is shifting.&mdash;@jessica_bunin Ferguson agrees that the use of ventilators becomes an issue with doctors, pulled into a crisis situation, who are less experienced with the devices. But he said the IC community of doctors he's in touch with are well aware that treatment of COVID-19 patients needs to be individualized, which was Gattinoni's main point. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?CBC IN ITALYThe lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world Laura Duggan, an anesthesiologist at the Ottawa Hospital, told the Emcrit podcast for emergency and critical care doctors that, like many ICU doctors, she looked to intubate patients with low oxygen right away, but that she's \"happy to see that pendulum swinging back a bit\" to figuring out what else can be done. \"I think there is a balance to be had between finding something that's simple and widely applicable versus trying to still personalize things for each patient,\" said Ferguson. 
  The provincial government is refusing to discuss numbers of ventilators in northeastern Ontario hospitals, but assures the public that there will enough if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse. The Northeast Local Health Integration Network, the provincial agency overseeing the health system in the region, directed the question to the Ministry of Health. The ministry says it has a stockpile of 200 ventilators ready to be distributed across Ontario and has 300 more on order, but didn't answer CBC's question about how many of the breathing machines are in the northeast now. The region's largest hospital Health Sciences North in Sudbury, which isn't providing any staff for media interviews during the COVID-19 crisis, says it has 62 ventilators and isn't worried about a shortage thanks to that provincial stockpile. The Sault Area Hospital has started putting up tents to help handle extra patients who may come during a COVID-19 outbreak.   (Submitted by Sault Area Hospital ) Dr. Rishi Ghosh from the Sault Area Hospital says they have 12 ventilators, but four of them are on loan from the province to deal with patient surges and could be moved elsewhere. \"We're anxious about how many patients are going to need these and if we have enough to provide all the patients,\" says Ghosh, the medical director of critical care and cardiology. He says the Sault Ste. Marie hospital also has several machines that help people with chronic lung problems, plus ventilators used during surgeries that could help COVID patients \"in a pinch.\ " \"These things can change in a flash, so if we get an influx, it's very easy to use up 10 or 12 vents in a couple of days,\" says Ghosh. Sudbury's Health Sciences North issues plea for personal protective equipmentHealth Sciences North now screening all visitors to Sudbury hospital He says plans are being put in place to establish \"hot and cold\" zones in the hospital to isolate those infected with coronavirus. Sault Area Hospital is also setting up tents outside to deal with extra patients. Ghosh says the tough part will be if they have to decide who gets a machine to help them breathe and who doesn't.

  The death toll in New York, the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, was \"effectively flat\" for the second day in a row, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in his daily news conference on Monday. The overall death toll climbed by 599 to 4,758, while Cuomo expressed cautious optimism in the daily increase of new hospitalizations (358) and new admissions into intensive care (128). Cuomo said there were some signs that the spread of the virus in New York has slowed, but cautioned: \"It could still go any way.\ " The current strain on the state's blend of public and private hospitals in New York City, he said, was \"unsustainable at this rate.\" Not long after Cuomo spoke, the United States as a whole had reached a death toll of more than 10,000, according to the coronavirus resource centre at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. The U.S. has seen 10,335 die from COVID-19 causes, according to the tally, with national confirmed cases at more than 347,000. It represents unwelcome exponential growth in mortality, with the U.S. having surpassed 1,000 deaths on March 26, 11 days ago. ' Peak death week,' admiral predicts The Trump administration itself is girding for a tough week in the coronavirus battle, with hopes that the physical distancing measures and stay-at-home orders seen around the country will help the number of cases and fatalities level off next week. \"It's going to be the peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week,\ " Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and member of the White House coronavirus task force, told ABC's Good Morning America on Monday.

Smith/AFP/Getty Images) A report from the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released Monday indicates three of four U.S. hospitals surveyed are already treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The report also says that hospitals expect to be overwhelmed as cases rocket toward their projected peak. The report warns that different, widely reported problems are feeding off each other in a vicious cycle. Such problems include insufficient tests, slow results, scarcity of protective gear, the shortage of breathing machines for seriously ill patients and burned-out staffs anxious for their own safety. \"There's this sort of domino effect,\" said Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general at the DHHS. \"These challenges play off each other and exacerbate the situation. There's a cascade effect.\" Mobile users: View the document (PDF KB) (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content Last week, President Trump attempted to reduce that shortage by limiting the amount of equipment that would leave the country.  Using his authority under the 1950 Defence Production Act, he announced the U.S. would stop exporting N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting health-care workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, outraged many officials in Canada. Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus But on Monday evening, 3M released a statement saying it had struck a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to supply N95 masks to other countries, including Canada.   \"As the pandemic unfolds in different stages around the world,\" the company said in a statement, \"3M will continue to work with governments to direct respirators and other supplies to serve areas most in need.\" U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters following a meeting of his coronavirus task force at the White House on April 6. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In dealing with shortages, many hospitals are responding by improvising their own solutions. Some explored buying face masks from nail salons due to the shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE. Others have been trying to make their own hand sanitizer by blending ultrasound gel with alcohol from local distilleries. Overtime hours and increased use of supplies are raising costs at the same time that many hospitals experience a revenue crunch because elective surgeries have been cancelled.

The head of a group representing for-profit hospitals said Monday that, on top of the problems in the report, facilities are finding that COVID-19 patients take long to recover. \"We are finding that their lengths of stay are much longer than comparable illnesses like pneumonia and flu, and they are requiring a lot of drugs,\" said Chip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals. How to set priorities for the use of ventilators, breathing machines that can sustain life, is one of the most worrisome questions. Hospitals from Louisiana to New York and Michigan are already confronting projected shortages, the AP reported last week. \"Government needs to provide guidelines on ethics if health resources are limited and decisions need to be made about which patients to treat,\" a hospital official in Broward County, Fla., told the inspector general's office. \"Are physicians liable for their decisions if that happens?\" Nurses at Harlem Hospital hold a rally demanding greater access to PPE to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in front of the hospital in Manhattan on Monday.    (Aleksandra Michalska/Reuters) More than 90 per cent of U.S. residents are under some kind of stay-at-home order. The exceptions are eight states, all with governors from Trump's Republican Party: Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Georgia, which has recorded 6,600 cases and more than 200 deaths, ordered residents to stay home but then allowed some beaches to reopen. In Washington, D.C., and other places, some people flouted the physical distancing guidelines over the weekend. Sunshine and warm weather brought hordes of people out to bike trails and open spaces near the Potomac River. While a number of people wore masks, some groups moved together in close proximity. 
  Dr. Michael Warner is preparing for battle. He's head of the intensive care unit at the Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, and he knows that any day he's about to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. \"It's ominous. There's an air of foreboding,\" he said. \"This is coming. There are already ICUs in the Greater Toronto Area with patients with COVID-19.\ " It's also a battle he knows he can't fight without the necessary equipment. \"This is like D-Day. I'm on the boats and I don't know where the guns are,\ " he said. \"You don't know what the enemy looks like, and you don't know how long the battle will last. \"And you don't know if you have enough artillery and armour to protect you for the full battle.\" Dr. Michael Warner, head of the intensive care unit at the Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, has been trying to round up as many supplies as possible for his hospital. (Michael Garron Hospital                                                      ) One of the most critical pieces of armour is a simple disposable mask with a stamp that reads: N95. He knows there won't be enough of them. Having that mask could be the difference between life and death for a patient, because doctors and nurses need to protect themselves from viral contamination before they can insert a breathing tube. \"I don't want to be in the position where I'm saying, 'Sorry, I can't help your father, mother, child because I don't have the personal protective equipment,'\" he said. \"That's a personal nightmare for me.\ " 'People want to do something' Who else uses these special disposable masks? Carpenters. Construction workers. So Warner started contacting people he knows in those industries asking for help. He said if they have any N95s, let him know, because he needs them for the hospital. He didn't stop there. He also knows there won't be enough ventilators — mechanical breathing machines that can keep critically ill COVID-19 patients alive long enough for their lungs to recover. Who else has ventilators? Cosmetic surgeons. Soon, Warner had prominent plastic surgeons organizing their network to start rounding up ventilators. Veterinarians who treat large animals also use ventilators in their emergency rooms. So Warner sent some more emails. Would animal ventilators work on humans? \"I don't know enough about animal ventilators to know, but I think at this point everything is on the table,\ " Warner said. Everyone got back to him immediately, pledging to do what they can to help. \"People want to do something, if there is something they can do,\" he said. \"They just want to be told, and they'll do it.\ " Lesley MacNeil, an assistant professor of biochemistry at McMaster University in Hamilton, gathered up supplies for the local hospital. (Lesley MacNeil) Warner said it was the best use of his remaining time before the surge of sick patients begins. \"I can't wait for a shipment of N95 masks that might never come from the government.\" Running out of time Federal and provincial governments have announced measures over the past few days to increase the supply of hospital equipment, including masks. An interim order passed by the federal health minister on Wednesday will make it easier to import COVID-19 test kits. But already the strains on supplies are starting to appear. Some regions are running low on nasal swabs used to test patients for COVID-19. And Canada is competing to buy masks with the U.S. and countries all over the world that are grappling with the global shortage. Some Toronto hospitals could run out of some supplies within two weeks — and that's based on usage rates over the last month, not counting an increase in consumption rates expected as COVID-19 patients begin flooding hospitals. That's why Warner is asking business leaders, manufacturers and innovators to come with rapid private sector solutions. \"We are going to need these supplies very soon,\ " he said. Warner said he knows governments are scrambling to increase supplies, but he's not sure they understand how critical a simple mask can be. \"I think they recognize that [personal protective equipment] is important. I don't know if they understand how quickly we could burn through it, and the catastrophic nature of that problem,\ " he said. \"We can have all the ventilators in the world, but they will sit idle if you can't intubate a patient to put on that machine.\" Michael Hendricks of McGill University is contributing supplies from his lab to help health-care providers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. (Sarah Moser) While Warner was reaching out to construction workers and veterinarians, Michael Hendricks was rummaging around the supply cupboards in his McGill University lab searching for N95 masks, boxes of latex gloves, and chemicals he uses to study the nervous systems of nematode worms. Hendricks and researchers across Canada have received urgent emails from both provincial and federal health agencies asking them to donate testing chemicals, called reagents, and other laboratory supplies for COVID-19 testing. With the supplies on back order, provinces are forced to ration their COVID-19 tests. But many research labs that study biological science would have the necessary reagents. \"These are reagents that are involved in isolating RNA from samples,\ " Hendricks said.  \"And reagents are used for the amplification tests to see if the virus is there.\ " Hendricks piled up whatever he had for pickup. \"We had some N95 masks and about 100 regular surgical procedure masks. We have a ton of gloves — pick a size. We had recently ordered a bunch of boxes of gloves. We had thousands. We sent some of the RNA isolation kit materials as well.\" Research labs across the country are being scoured for supplies that are desperately needed in hospitals.   (Michael Hendricks) Hendricks was happy to be contributing to the fight against COVID-19. He said the university research labs are quiet. All of the students have been told to go home. All of the research has been put on hold. The Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services is organizing the collection at McGill, while at McMaster University, supplies are being collected for the local Hamilton Health Sciences hospital. Lesley MacNeil, an assistant professor of biochemistry at McMaster, was among the researchers gathering supplies. Even though she doesn't study viruses specifically, she was still able to contribute some personal protective equipment including gloves, face shields and eye goggles. \"Right now, the labs are shutting down. So we just gave them everything we had,\ " she said.

  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.   WATCH |  Dr. Samir Gupta explains what you should consider before putting on a mask against COVID-19: Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Which mask is recommended for health-care workers? For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask?

A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places. CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisisYour guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada The researchers also said that for cultural reasons, masks are considered a hygienic practice even for healthy people in Asia, while in North America it's considered something only sick people do.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  The Thunder Bay International Airports Authority (TBIAA) announced Tuesday it is taking additional measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, including reminders about the importance of observing two metres of social distancing at all times. People dropping off or picking up friends and family can park for free in the short-term lot, with airport officials asking people to remain in their cars and \"refrain from entering the Terminal building unless absolutely essential or in case of an emergency\". Officials also stated that \"enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols are strictly in effect throughout the airport including the terminal building, luggage pick up and drop-off areas, security facilities, public washrooms, departure and arrival lounges. Some services, such as escalators are being suspended to reduce the number of possible transfer points and to intensify cleaning in areas remaining open.\ " As well, food outlets, with the exception of vending machines, have been closed in accordance with government guidelines. Kathy Kortes-Miller, who was at the airport Sunday to pick up her teenage son who had been on a student exchange in Europe, said she is pleased to learn of the additional measures. \"I think the free parking is a great first step,\ " she noted early Tuesday before the TBIAA released its full list of new protocols. Airport 'working tirelessly' for safety Kortes-Miller had been worried by what she saw at the airport on the weekend and expressed her concerns in a letter she shared with officials at the city, the health unit, the airport and on Facebook. \"What I saw was business as usual. Yes it was a bit more quiet because there isn't the same number of flights coming in and out, but people were not physically distancing. People were touching things. I was not greeted with directions on how to be safe and monitor the safety of other people.\" Kortes-Miller said she even refrained from hugging her son, who is now in self-isolation at their home, adding they are disinfecting all surfaces he may touch there. The TBIAA stated Tuesday that employees are required to follow strict personal hygiene protocols including regular handwashing, regular cleaning of work spaces, wearing PPE where necessary and if they feel sick to stay home and self-isolate. The authority stated it \"is working tirelessly to help keep our passengers and colleagues safe.

  A technology originally conceived to remotely monitor the heart rates of premature babies has been transformed into a potential way to scan huge groups for illnesses like COVID-19. A Canadian company is adapting the technology for drones and closed-circuit video cameras. But being able to scan people from up to 50 metres away and tell if they're sick, potentially without them knowing, raises some big privacy concerns.   The technology connects video cameras, including those equipped with thermal-imaging systems, to a computer program with learning algorithms.   The system can monitor temperature, heart and respiratory rate, and tell when someone is sneezing or coughing. The computer can determine if someone has a respiratory illness or infectious disease, according to Javeen Chahl, a professor of engineering at the University of South Australia. Chahl headed up the research developing the system.   Equipping drones with this technology will allow the computer system to scan large groups to determine if they're sick.   (Draganfly Inc.) The more video the program has of people sick with a particular disease, the better it is at detecting signs of that illness. To get more footage of people with COVID-19, a pilot project using the system is expected to be run in the New York City area in the coming weeks.   The technology is attracting attention in Canada, where some airports have expressed an interest, according to Canadian drone manufacturer Draganfly Inc.     Chahl has partnered with Draganfly to expand the use of his research. The company wants to sell the technology to governments, along with medical and commercial customers.   Draganfly has a manufacturing plant in Saskatoon and offices in Vancouver and the U.S.  Much of its business has come from selling drones to first responders. Cameron Chell is the CEO of Draganfly Inc. (Draganfly Inc.) Both Chahl and Draganfly hope this technology will provide a quick way to screen for COVID-19 and help detect the spread of other diseases. \"This technology can be used … even as a global early-warning system,\" said Cameron Chell, the CEO of Draganfly Inc.  \"It's really designed to get stats on what's actually happening, so the real decisions can be made and policy can be set.\ " Chell said the cost of the pandemic has already been too high with thousands of deaths worldwide and billions of dollars in economic loss. He said being able to get timely information on how many people are sick and where they are located are ways to help governments and health authorities stop the spread of infectious diseases.   Chell plans to adapt the computer system to work with security cameras as well. (CBC) But developing this kind of technology, especially during an emergency, is a concern for David Fraser, a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper in Halifax. Fraser said sometimes companies and governments rush to develop technologies or procedures during a crisis without full consideration of public privacy or security.   He said proper checks and balances need to be put in place before any kind of new scanning technology is used. \"To widely deploy a technology to collect baseline health information about a population, and about its individuals who are part of that population, that needs to be justified. It needs to be justifiable and that needs to be a societal conversation,\" said Fraser.    \"It has generally been my experience that the people who make the tools, or deploy the tools, or sell the tools are not the ones in a good position to evaluate the privacy impact of those tools.\ "    David Fraser is a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper. (McInnes Cooper) Chell understands those privacy concerns. He said the system is not designed to single out individuals, but to monitor the health of a population. However, that capability might not be far away.   Chell likens the rise of this kind of medical scanning technology to the widespread use of metal detectors and body scanners at airports after 9/11. \"Health protection is as important as firearms protection,\" said Chell.  \"I think this is part of the new reality and we're going to have to learn how to be OK with it.\ " A health-care worker puts on a pair of gloves at a COVID-19 testing area in Burnaby, B.C., earlier this month. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press) Once the computer scans enough people with COVID-19, it could be used to screen individuals before they come into a hospital or health-care centre, said Chahl.   The system is not meant to replace traditional diagnostic tests, but can provide an additional screening method.   The computer could identify people with symptoms so they can be isolated as soon as they enter a facility. \"If you reduce … essential services personnel to half as much risk then they might be able to keep operating for twice as long before they contract the virus, for example. So it's a great benefit to filter and screen,\" said Chahl.    Thomas Trappenberg is a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University who researches machine learning.   (Thomas Trappenberg) Equipping a drone with the system would also be helpful, according to Chahl. He said if an organization was involved in a relief effort in an area hard hit by an infectious disease, a drone could get an idea of the health of the population without endangering anyone. But that's not yet possible.   No one is sure how much information would have to be fed into the system before it could correctly identify one illness from another.    It is possible to use computer programs to tell when a person is sick.  However, it's tricky trying to teach a machine how to identify a specific illness, according to Thomas Trappenberg, a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University. Trappenberg studies machine learning, the mechanism Chahl's computer program uses to identify sickness. \"They need a lot of data,\" said Trappenberg. \"How many data we have to feed them is also very hard to predict. \"I think this is what the company is trying to do right now, trying to get more images, and it is a little bit stabbing in the dark. But it's well worth probably trying it.\ " Draganfly has made a name for itself by selling its products to first responders in the United States.   (Draganfly Inc.) There are other problems that will have to be solved before the technology can be effective, according to Sageev Oore, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, also at Dalhousie.   \"On real streets with real people in real weather conditions, with real movement and real camera lenses that might get a little piece of dirt on them, all of those things add, cumulatively, a lot of challenge,\" said Oore.    Even so, Oore thinks the research is worth doing.   Chahl said more needs to be done before the system reaches its full potential.   Still the technology has been used to detect whether people were alive under debris, by comparing the way debris shifted in relation to a person's breathing frequency. It also succeeded at measuring the heart rate of premature babies in incubators.    Trying to figure out the heart rates of babies without the use of electrodes or other equipment is how the project started back in 2015.   Fraser said even with those successes, it's important the determinations the computer makes about someone's health are confirmed by medical testing. He applauds people who want to use their skills to try to help society cope with this pandemic, but he said people still need to be cautious.    MORE TOP STORIES  Some N.S. nursing homes end window visits amid COVID-19 concernsMedical marathon: Doctors deal with their own stress so they can fight COVID-19CBRM's struggle with virtual council meetings may be overPremier rolls out emergency plan to deal with COVID-19 at NorthwoodUnion asked to find more workers to help at Northwood  
  Life-saving resources — like ventilators , ICU equipment and staff — vary from health region to health region. (Thaiview/Shutterstock) With the peak of the coronavirus pandemic expected later this year, life-saving resources in each of Newfoundland and Labrador's health regions vary.   In Labrador-Grenfell Health, where the province's first cases of COVID-19 appeared in early March, there is one four-bed intensive-care unit, at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony on the Northern Peninsula. There are no designated ICU beds in Labrador. Through a spokesperson, Labrador-Grenfell Health declined an interview, but in a statement the health authority said anyone requiring highly specialized tertiary care will be transported to Eastern Health. Intensive care is \"defined by the level of care required, skill set of staff and equipment, it is not a location,\" says the statement. The statement says the authority has 15 ventilators and is searching for 15 more. Wabush Mayor Ron Barron says he is worried about a surge in cases in the region. He has called for people entering Labrador West to isolate for 14 days. File photo. (Jacob Barker/CBC) With just four of those ventilators and two oxygen rooms in Labrador West, Wabush Mayor Ron Barron worries about a surge of cases. \"It's definitely a wakeup call as to what we do have available,\" said Barron. \"Is it enough? Right now it is, because we don't have any cases really. [But] if this took off in the region we wouldn't be nowhere near ready to look after people with what we have.\ " Barron is among a number of community leaders calling on the province to halt non-essential travel to Labrador, which has three cases of COVID-19, which the provincial government has rejected. Barron also wants people entering the region to isolate for 14 days.   \"This is how this stuff gets spread, it's travel. So let's limit every minute of travel that anybody has to take,\" said Barron. \"What's really disheartening is that the premier didn't listen to the people here in Labrador.\ " Meanwhile, 34 employees and physicians at Labrador-Grenfell Health are self-isolating, and one health-care worker has tested positive for coronavirus as of Wednesday. Western Health Western Health can isolate patients in dedicated coronavirus units at the Western Memorial Regional Hospital in Corner Brook and at the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital in Stephenville. There are 27 beds in Corner Brook's COVID-19 unit, with planning underway for a second 11-bed unit. In Stephenville, there are six beds. Western Memorial Regional Hospital's ICU has eight beds available with the capacity for three more, and 10 more in the operating room recovery area. In the Sir Thomas Roddick Hospital there are two ICU beds, with room for one more. The Western region has 29 ventilators and is looking for 15 more.   All four of Labrador-Grenfell Health's ICU beds are at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony. (Google Streetview) Teara Freake, Western Health's vice-president of clinical-patient services, said the long-term care facility due to open this spring in Corner Brook can be used to fee up hospital beds. She said they plan to move patients who are in hospital waiting for long-term care beds to the new facility. \"So that would then create capacity within Western Memorial for the COVID patients or any additional acute-care patients who require a higher level of care,\ " said Freake. Freake says Western Health is prepared to face a surge in cases. \"We feel we have the competency of staff and the appropriate skill mix to be able to care for patients.\" Central Health In Central Health, the second-largest health authority in the province, there are 23 beds in a dedicated COVID-19 unit at the Central Newfoundland Regional Health Centre in Grand Falls-Windsor. The health region has 17 ventilators and 17 ICU beds. The College of the North Atlantic, and stadiums in Gander and Grand-Falls Windsor, would be used for surge capacity, with 100 cots available. As of Thursday, 36 employees and physicians were self-isolating, and none were positive for COVID-19. Eastern Health The bulk of the province's coronavirus cases — 227 cases — are in the Eastern Health region, the largest region in the province, where most of the province's life-saving resources are. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. Eastern Health has 65 ICU beds and 127 ventilators. The region also has a 30-bed COVID-19 unit and is planning a second unit with 11 beds.

  The federal government is finalizing a plan to boost production of ventilators and other medical equipment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior government sources tell CBC News they're hoping to work with existing manufacturers — especially of gloves, masks and ventilators — on a supply chain that's resistant to disruption. An announcement is expected from the prime minister on Friday, which will also encourage other industries to retool their production lines to make those products. In addition, sources say, almost every program within the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development will be \"refocused\" on fighting the virus. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly.   Major federal programs — such as the Strategic Innovation Fund, a pool of money set aside by Ottawa in 2017 to \"spur innovation for a better Canada\"; and the $950-million Innovation Superclusters Initiative — will be \"tasked to be part of the solution,\ " one source said. WATCH | PM says military procurement could help produce medical equipment: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not rule anything out when it comes to ensuring Canadians have access to enough medical equipment, including using military procurement as a possible option. 0:47 The National Research Council of Canada, the country's primary research and development organization, will also be part of the response. The goal, the source said, is \"to fight COVID and help come up with a cure.\" Ventilators in particular, could spell the difference between life and death for many patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus which can damage the lungs. Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said that while there is no current shortage of ventilators, federal officials are trying to prevent one by managing existing inventories and securing more of the machines — preparing for the possibility that the COVID-19 caseload could start overwhelming hospitals. In a conference call with more than 300 Canadian business leaders on Thursday afternoon, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains said he is looking at \"how we use our current industrial capacity to … build some of those very essential pieces of equipment, from ventilators, to gloves, to gowns, to masks.\ " Federal cabinet considers leveraging military in mobilizing health manufacturing sector against COVID-19No Indigenous community will be 'left behind' in COVID-19 response, says minister Bains said he is \"finalizing some of these details\" with cabinet to fast-track procurement. \"Those are going to be critical for frontline health workers and how we deal with this crisis,\" he said on the call. The World Health Organization warned last week of global shortages and price-gouging on ventilators and personal protective equipment, and urged companies and governments to increase production by 40 per cent. Canada's automakers and aerospace manufacturers have recently been in talks with federal officials about stepping in to fill critical shortages of medical supplies. Both the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and Aerospace Industries Association of Canada said they have spoken to officials from Ottawa. Meanwhile, high-end parka maker Canada Goose said it's in discussions about making medical gowns. Its retail stores and in-house production facilities are closed until at least March 31. While working with companies already producing medical supplies is the preferred option, the sources say everything is \"on the table.\" But getting non-medical companies to produce unfamiliar, emergency medical equipment is no simple task. They face significant hurdles before they could build a complex piece of equipment like a ventilator, while other products need to be manufactured in a sterile environment. Government expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister It's not clear how long it would take for companies to reinvent themselves. Auto industry insiders say, for example, the process could take months for car companies. In the United States, auto giants General Motors and Ford said they have been chatting with the Trump administration about making ventilators. On Thursday, the prime minister said Canada might also use its military procurement policy to get medical equipment. \"We are considering using any measures necessary,\ " Justin Trudeau said at a news conference outside his home. \"We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well.\ "
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states. WATCH | How to wash your hands like a surgeon Can washing your hands really slow the spread of COVID-19? That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said. Mask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more actionHome care workers worry about shortage of protective equipment during pandemic: union \"Those are the masks that you want to consider reprocessing. But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Nova Scotians will see dramatic changes in just about all ways of life in the coming days as officials prepare for the potential spread of COVID-19. The Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre are suspending non-urgent and elective services, public gatherings will be limited to 50 people and all bars have been ordered to close. There are now seven cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia. Six cases are presumed positive and one case has been confirmed positive by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. As of Tuesday, Nova Scotia has done 934 other tests that came back negative. Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief medical officer, said the two new presumptive cases are travel-related and connected to earlier cases. \"Public health is continuing to do their work on following up on previous cases and on these new cases,\ " Strang told a news conference Tuesday.   He said that follow-up work is extensive, and close contacts of those presumptive cases have been contacted. The people who have COVID-19 are in self-isolation and are recovering at home and their close contacts have also been told to self-isolate. \"Public health is in control of our cases and of our contacts,\" said Strang, who discouraged people from actively trying to seek out people who aren't following the rules. Strang said they're minimizing the amount of information they provide about cases in the interest of privacy, while also ensuring people in the public have the information they need. None of the follow-up work has suggested that any of the cases are the result of \"general community spread,\" said Strang. Government set to announce $25B aid package to help Canadians through COVID-19 crisis THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 17 Changes to health-care services The update comes on the same day the Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre said they'd be suspending all non-urgent services as part of planned pandemic response. The changes include limiting surgical procedures to urgent and emergency cases only. Emergency departments will remain open, as will the IWK's emergency mental health and addiction services. The health authority said its dialysis, chemotherapy and radiation treatments would continue, as would mental health and addictions appointments. Dr. Brendan Carr, CEO of the health authority, said plans are in place for all regions to establish secondary assessment sites. The plan also includes keeping patients who need hospitalization in regional centres. As part of that preparation, patients in acute care beds who don't need to be there will be moved back out to the community before COVID-19 patients are in hospitals. Carr said officials are ready for whatever might come. \"Our teams have been working flat-out for three months to get ready for this,\ " he said. ' Think about what's happening' Dr. Krista Jangaard, CEO of the IWK, said the decisions were difficult, but the right ones to make, given the circumstances. She asked for patience from the public as the changes take place. \"This is a place where we all need to work together,\ " she said. Jangaard said the changes would mean they could reassess how staff would be used within the system. Although children have been less affected by the virus so far, Jangaard said staff at the IWK are ready for whatever may come. \"This is our day-to-day business.\ " Premier Stephen McNeil stressed again the requirement for anyone who has been outside the country to self-isolate for 14 days when they get home, even if they don't have symptoms, and for everyone to regularly wash their hands. \"These are simple asks, when you think about what's happening around the world.\" New protocol changes for businesses McNeil said public gatherings would now be limited to 50 people or fewer. He said people should be home, unless it's to make necessary trips to grocery stores, especially as more people return to the province from out-of-country trips. \"My message to Nova Scotians is to be home with your loved ones,\" he said. \"Try to be out of the public as much as you can be.\" Starting Thursday, restaurants will only be able to provide takeout or delivery services and all bars will be required to close. The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation will begin operating on reduced services. It will be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Saturday for the general public. It will be open from 10-11 a.m. only for vulnerable populations, including senior citizens. Access Nova Scotia and Registry of Motor Vehicle Offices are temporarily closing for one week starting Wednesday so they can establish services that minimize contact between people. Some services are available online and the government is extending March, April and May driver licence and vehicle registration expirations to Aug. 31. On Sunday, the province announced the first three presumptive cases of the virus, which happened to three people who returned from different international trips to California, Europe and Australia. One of those cases has since been confirmed. On that same day, McNeil announced schools and daycares would close. On Monday, two more presumptive cases were announced, a man and woman in their 50s who attended a number of gatherings with people who had travelled internationally. All of the province's COVID-19 cases have been listed as mild, with the patients recovering at home in self-isolation.

A Liberal source speaking on background told CBC News that some premiers offered to forgo their expected deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to divert the supplies to provinces with a greater need.   Spread likely wider than recorded cases Globally, the number of cases surged past one million Thursday, according to a database maintained by Johns Hopkins University. The Baltimore-based university has been tracking the recorded cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that first emerged in China. The database, which shows a worldwide total of more than 980,000 cases, draws data from a range of sources including the World Health Organization, national and regional health agencies and media reports.  But experts say the real spread of the virus is likely wider than suggested by recorded cases.   Wear masks if you want — but keep up the handwashing and physical distancing, say Tam and Hajdu Alberta hospitals prepare for COVID-19 influx 'that will certainly test our capacity'   The real figures are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, differences in counting the dead and large numbers of mild cases that have gone unreported. Critics say some governments have been deliberately under-reporting cases in order to avoid public criticism. Most cases of COVID-19 are mild to moderate, but some people — particularly older adults and people with underlying health conditions  — face an increased risk of severe disease and death. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, on Thursday said at least 50 deaths in the country are linked to long-term care homes, senior residences and \"other care facilities.\ " But she also reiterated that COVID-19 spares \"no one\" and urged caution across age groups. In Canada, provinces and territories are implementing ever-tighter public health measures and restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the disease, as well as planning ahead for an expected surge in hospitalizations.   Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller confirmed there are 15 cases in Indigenous communities and that the government is providing an additional $305 million to those communities to help deal with the outbreak.   WATCH | Health minister says Canada 'likely did not have enough' protective gear: Health Minister Patty Hajdu says that successive federal governments have for decades underfunded public health preparedness, resulting in an insufficient amount of personal protective equipment in the federal pandemic stockpile. 1:58 \"There is a historical mistrust of government in a number of Indigenous communities,\" he said, noting that mistrust can be a barrier to getting important messages out about how best to tackle the spread of the virus. But he said: \"This is a gap that must be filled by Indigenous leadership and they are filling it exceptionally well.\ " Freeing up hospital beds In Alberta, health officials have delayed surgeries, expanded ERs and made moves to allow Alberta Health Services to free up beds for an expected increase in COVID-19 patients. Dr. Neil Collins, who has been handling the coronavirus response for emergency departments in the Calgary health zone, told CBC Calgary that \"we are preparing for an increase that will certainly test our capacity.\ "  Premier Jason Kenney said this week that things \"will get worse before they get better,\" but also said the province's health system has the equipment and staff needed to cope with the peak of the outbreak, which the province says could come in May.  Kenney has said his province plans to present a \"fairly detailed briefing\" on its modelling for the pandemic in Alberta. Construction workers help assemble a makeshift hospital outside the Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington, Ont. , on Wednesday. The hospital is gearing up for patients to be treated for COVID-19. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington, Ont., is installing a temporary 93-bed structure on its grounds to help prepare for an uptick in cases.  The hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Ian Preyra, says the pandemic response unit will allow the hospital to keep its critical-care and high-acuity beds for the sickest patients.

There have also been two COVID-19-related deaths of Canadians abroad: one in Japan and one in Brazil. Public health officials have cautioned that the numbers likely don't capture the full scope of the outbreak because they don't include people who haven't been tested and potential cases still under investigation.

Republicans, meanwhile, are expressing confidence their convention will take place as scheduled in August; U.S. President Donald Trump said last week there is \"no way\" it would be moved. It was also announced that last week more than 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits — doubling a record high set just one week earlier — a sign that layoffs are accelerating in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The stunning report Thursday from the United States Labor Department showed that job cuts are mounting against the backdrop of economies in the U.S. and abroad having almost certainly sunk into a severe recession as businesses close across the world. The figure for last week is much higher than the previous record of 3.3 million reported for the previous week. At a COVID-19 briefing late Thursday, White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said incoming infection data suggests not enough Americans are abiding by guidelines to stem the spread of the virus. The U.S., with a population of about 327 million, has recorded more than 5,800 deaths and more than 240,000 infections. From New York to Los Angeles, U.S. officials are warning that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is ahead.  In hot zones, such as New York and New Jersey, 35 per cent of tests conducted are positive for COVID-19, Birx said.   People walk by the Lumiere Music Hall theatre, displaying messages of solidarity, in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Wednesday.

(Valeria Macon/AFP/Getty Images) New York state's coronavirus death toll doubled in 72 hours to more than 1,900. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has already complained that U.S. states are competing against each other for protective gear and breathing machines, or being outbid by the federal government. Trump acknowledged that the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment used by doctors and nurses is nearly depleted. \"We're going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific,\ " he said. On Thursday, the president invoked the Defense Production Act to aid companies building ventilators. In a memo released by the White House, Trump directed the U.S. health and human services secretary to use his authority to help facilitate the supply of ventilator materials for six companies, including General Electric Co., Hill-Rom Holdings Inc. and Medtronic Plc. The act was also invoked for an order for 3M to make masks.

He cited research showing asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus without realizing it. At the briefing, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence said updated CDC guidance on the wearing of face coverings and masks will come in the next several days. Trump, who said he took a new rapid test for coronavirus because he wanted to see how fast it would be, indicated he would support such a recommendation. \"If people wanted to wear them, they can,\" said the president, who again tested negative. \"If people wanted to use scarves, they can.\ " As hotspots flared in New Orleans and Southern California, the nation's biggest city, New York, was the hardest hit of them all, with crematoriums extending their hours, and city officials are surveying cemeteries elsewhere in the state for temporary interment sites.

At the task force briefing, Trump said that the Javit Center in New York City will be converted to a COVID-19 hospital staffed by the military at Cuomo's request. The same would be done with facilities in Louisiana and Dallas. Cuomo said projections suggest the crisis in New York will peak at the end of April, with a high death rate continuing through July. Here's a look at what's happening in hard-hit Italy, Spain and parts of Europe From Reuters and The Associated Press, updated at 5 p.m. ET: The head of the World Health Organization's office in Europe says figures show that more than 95 per cent of people who have died of COVID-19 on the continent have been aged over 60. But Dr. Hans Kluge said age is not the only risk factor for severe disease, noting: \"The very notion that COVID-19 only affects older people is factually wrong.\ " In an online news conference Thursday in Copenhagen, Kluge said \"young people are not invincible\ " — echoing similar recent comments from WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. WATCH | How young people may be fuelling the spread of COVID-19: Despite older people and those with pre-existing conditions being more vulnerable, 12 per cent of those hospitalized in Canada with COVID-19 are under 40. 1:44 The UN health agency says 10 per cent to 15 per cent of people under 50 with the disease have moderate or severe infection. \"Severe cases of the disease have been seen in people in their teens or 20s with many requiring intensive care and some unfortunately passing away,\ " Kluge said. He said recent statistics showed 30,098 people have been reported to have died in Europe, mostly in Italy, France and Spain. \"We know that over 95 per cent of these deaths occurred in those older than 60 years,\ " he said, with more than half aged over 80. Kluge said more than four in five of those people had at least one other chronic underlying condition, like cardiovascular disease, hypertension or diabetes. \"On a positive note, there are reports of people over the age of 100 who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 and have now — since — made a complete recovery,\ " he said. Spain hit a new record Thursday in virus-related fatalities with 950 deaths in 24 hours, which came as the country is seeing the growth of contagion waning, health ministry data showed. The total number of deaths by Thursday was 10,096. New coronavirus infections rose by nearly eight per cent overnight to 110,238, placing Spain neck and neck with Italy, the country that has had the worst outbreak in Europe. Health authorities have been saying that the pace of contagion has dropped from a daily average of 20 per cent until March 25 to less than 12 per cent after that date, more than 10 days after Spaniards were ordered to stay at home. The government has acknowledged that the real number of infections could be much higher because Spain only has the capacity to do between 15,000 and 20,000 tests per day.

(Alvaro Calvo/Getty Images) Italy added another 760 dead to its coronavirus toll, bringing the count in the country with the most deaths to 13,915. New infections continued to level off, three weeks into what was the West's first nationwide shutdown. Pressure on hospitals in hard-hit Lombardy continued to ease, with more than 800 people recovered and 165 fewer people hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to a day earlier. Intensive care units are still saturated, but overall, Lombardy added just under 1,300 new cases, with about half of those being treated at home.    The lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world    Confirmed cases in Germany have risen to 84,600, while 1,097 people have died of the disease. Cases rose by 6,156, compared with the previous day, and the death toll climbed by 140. President Vladimir Putin has ordered most Russians to stay off work until the end of the month to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Putin said there are exceptions for essential industries to keep operating, and grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open. He said that it would be up to the regional authorities to decide which sectors should keep working in their areas. He said Russia's virus-prevention strategies have bought time and helped slow down the outbreak in the country, but he also warned that infections haven't yet peaked. Russia had reported 3,548 cases and 30 virus-related deaths as of Thursday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. Experts have questioned how accurate those numbers are, given Russia's vast size and shared borders with China and Europe. France's death toll jumped to more than 5,400 on Thursday, as the country started including fatalities in nursing homes in its data. A provisional tally showed that 884 people had died in nursing homes, raising the toll significantly only a day after France became the fourth country to pass 4,000 deaths. Britain has written off 13.4 billion pounds ($23.6 billion Cdn) of historic debt that hospitals owe in order to free up resources in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the country would ramp up the number of tests amid widespread criticism that they were doing far too few. And in the Netherlands, measures to limit the outbreak appear to have halved the rate of infection but need to be continued to be really effective, a top health official said. Here's a look at what's happening in hard-hit China, South Korea, Iran and some other areas of concern From Reuters and The Associated Press, updated at 10:00 p.m. ET China logged fewer reported new infections Friday morning, registering 31 new cases, down from 35 the day before.  An increased focus on asymptomatic carriers is stoking fears among the population. There were 60 asymptomatic cases reported Friday, even as China faced questions about how it records cases and reports case numbers. There were no new cases in Hubei province, where the pandemic began, but four new deaths.     Why some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claims   South Korea will allow coronavirus patients to vote by mail as parliamentary elections begin this month. The country is still grappling with a steady rise in infections, reporting 89 new infections on Thursday, raising the total tally to 9,976, while the death toll rose by four to 169.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is being derided on social media for offering cloth masks instead of declaring a coronavirus state of emergency. The prime minister returned to power in 2012 promising to revive growth with a policy mix dubbed Abenomics, and he has promised a huge fiscal package to counter the outbreak's blow to the economy. \"If you declare an emergency , it is definitely the end of Abenomics, the end of 'economy first,'\" said Jesper Koll, CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Japan.    'Tremendously dangerous': In Iran, conspiracy theories and religious bickering slow COVID-19 response   With more than 50,400 reported cases, Iran has more than half of total coronavirus infections reported in the Middle East and over 3,600 deaths. In a rare acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak by a senior Iranian official, President Hassan Rouhani said the new coronavirus may remain through the end of the Iranian year, which just began late last month, state TV reported Thursday.   \"The corona issue is not an issue that we can say it will be ended [on a specific] day,\ " Rouhani said. \"It is possible corona will be with us for the coming months. It is possible it will be with us by the end of the year. We always have to follow healthy protocols provided by the health ministry.\"   Neighbouring Iraq has thousands more confirmed COVID-19 cases than the 772 it has publicly reported, according to doctors closely involved in the testing process and other senior officials. Three doctors, who work in pharmaceutical teams helping test suspected COVID-19 cases in Baghdad, each said that confirmed cases of the disease, based on discussions among fellow medics who see daily results, were between about 3,000 and 9,000 although they each gave different estimates. A health minister and political official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said confirmed cases were likely in the thousands. Iraq's health ministry, the country's only official outlet for information on COVID-19, could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country will pull out of its three-week lockdown in phases. The shutdown, which ordered 1.3 billion people indoors and brought Asia's third-largest economy to a shuddering halt, is due to end on April 14. It has left millions without jobs and forced migrant workers to flee to their villages for food and shelter. India has had 1,965 confirmed infections, of whom 50 have died — low figures by comparison with the United States, China, Italy and Spain. But the big worry is the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country, officials said.

The self-governed island claimed by Beijing has been seeking to showcase its own handling of the outbreak as it pushes back against China's efforts to isolate it diplomatically. Zambia has recorded its first death from coronavirus, and the number of confirmed cases has risen by three to 39, Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya said on Thursday. Meanwhile Rwanda, the first sub-Saharan country to impose a coronavirus lockdown, has now extended it by two weeks. Altogether, Africa has now registered almost 6,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 200 deaths. The continent is already suffering a huge economic impact from lockdowns aiming to contain the virus and a sharp fall in global demand for commodities.  To keep food aid flowing after most countries shut their borders, the United Nations food agency negotiated a humanitarian corridor through South Africa to countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi, Botswana and Namibia.  
  Medical researchers are working on multiple approaches to experimental vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The federal government announced $2.7 million in funding for vaccine candidates. Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is investing more than $23 million US in the development of new vaccines against COVID-19. France's president has announced a video summit of G7 leaders on Monday to discuss co-ordinating research on vaccines and treatments as well as an economic response to the pandemic. A vaccine would prevent the pandemic from spreading as fast as it is now, said Charu Kaushic, scientific director of Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Infection and Immunity. \"It's just spreading everywhere,\ " she said. \"If we had a vaccine , we could control it.\ " Kaushic said instead of putting all its eggs in one basket, CIHR is funding multiple projects in the hopes that at least one of them will work. 2 elements to a successful vaccine  To work, a vaccine needs to succeed in getting our immune system to produce antibodies in the blood. The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it. Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs. \"Vaccines can fail because you can get very good antibodies and other things that work great in the blood, but not in the lungs. \"You may not get protective immunity at all.\" An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute in  northern Israel this month, where efforts are underway to produce a vaccine against COVID-19.   (Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty) Viruses, especially new ones, are particularly difficult because they aren't well understood. For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted. Even though multiple researchers are working on the problem, it is rare to get a new vaccine in under a year. A top U.S. health official told a House committee that human trials for a potential vaccine could begin within a few weeks with the goal of going into the arms of the general public within 12 to 18 months. Vaccine in a year?   The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \"I want to make sure people understand, and I've said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\ " NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"We mean it's record time to get it tested. It's going to take a year to a year-and-a-half to really know if it works.\" Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material from the virus in the form of nucleic acid. That tells the human body how to make proteins that mimic viral proteins and this should provoke an immune response. Currently the pandemic coronavirus has infected more than 130,000 people worldwide.  While most people have mild respiratory symptoms, a vaccine would be a safer way to protect people because it would reduce the risk of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Denis Leclerc, an infectious diseases researcher at Laval University in Quebec City, said the advantage of nucleic acid vaccines like Moderna's is that they're much faster to produce than other types. Denis Leclerc and his colleagues at Laval University are hoping to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled in case of future outbreaks.   (Radio-Canada) While relatively safe, nucleic acid vaccines are generally not the preferred strategy, Leclerc said, because they don't have the same safety record as the traditional approach. Leclerc's team has a different approach. They are working with a small part of a protein from the virus that can be synthesized quickly and then attached to a platform to trigger an efficient immune response in humans. \"I was thinking of still using proteins to conserve very high safety and still get speed,\ " Leclerc said. His team has animal data showing this approach might work for coronavirus and for other viruses that emerge in future. Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study revealsAs coronavirus spread speeds up, Montreal researchers will trial an anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 in China Leclerc expects the proof-of-concept experiments for his COVID-19 vaccine will be ready in six months. Even though it's fast to develop, it may come too late for the current pandemic of COVID-19. That's what happened with Canada's Ebola vaccine. The experiments happened years previously, but the vaccine wasn't manufactured in time for the 2014 epidemic that ravaged West Africa. The Ebola vaccine is being used now to control Congo's outbreak. These Quebec professors are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccineFrom test strips to llama antibodies, U of O researchers take on COVID-19 Elsewhere in Quebec City, the biotech firm Medicago is producing another potential COVID-19 vaccine that uses particles that mimic the virus.

  Rhett Melnyk can't remember the last time he was off the ice this long.    The 15-year-old Vimy Ridge Academy hockey player is used to spending at least half of his day on skates playing the game he loves.   \"I've definitely been missing the ice for sure,\" said Melnyk, who has replaced ice time with a structured workout program he follows every morning at his Fort Saskatchewan home.    7 Workouts You Can Do At Home When You Can't Hit The Gym    Melnyk is supposed to be heading to Kennewick, Wash., this fall to play for the Western Hockey League's Tri-City Americans.   He was chosen in the second round, 33rd overall, of the 2019 WHL Bantam Draft. He played last season with the Fort Saskatchewan Rangers Midget AAA team, in the Alberta Midget Hockey League. For now, Melnyk and other Vimy Ridge student athletes are connecting with teachers and coaches who are setting up routines for them then sharing them online.   \"We're doing our best to try and communicate with them and trying to engage with them,\" said Stephen Armitage, program director for athletic and academic development at Vimy Ridge.   \"Obviously not having them in the school is a challenge,\" he said, \"and not being with them and not being able to guide them through their activities is a big difficulty that we're facing.\ " 'It's hard'   On the south side, the Edmonton Scottish United Soccer Club was getting ready to kick off its outdoor soccer season four weeks ago.   More than 1,000 youngsters are enrolled in the club's program.   While everyone waits, weekly online skills sessions are being hosted by coaches.   Teams are also doing online weekly group check-ins to stay connected.    \"For so many kids, the club is an important part of their life — not just their athletic life, but their social life,\ " said Kevin Poissant, the club's executive director.   \"These are friends that they're missing, these are coaches that they've enjoyed connecting with, and being away from that, it's hard.\ " It's a similar story in the west end at ATHX Performance, a training centre that works with youngsters of all ages offering individualized coaching in a variety of sports.   The gym is empty now, though the centre does offer virtual programs specific to the customer.

He suggests athletes make a list of personal goals, work on breathing and concentration, and visualize what getting back to playing will look like. 
  Hand sanitizer, gloves, masks and other medical equipment are in high demand — and in some cases are being offered at high prices. For now, many supermarkets and sellers are avoiding increasing their prices substantially, and social media users have shamed those that have. But aside from appeals to their corporate consciences, the federal government and provinces do have regulatory and legislative tools to prevent retailers and distributors from dramatically raising their prices. Competition watchdog issues a warning On Friday morning, following a CBC inquiry, the Competition Bureau issued a bulletin assuring Canadians it stands ready to act to protect customers. \"As Canada responds to the COVID-19 coronavirus situation, I would like to assure Canadians that the Competition Bureau remains vigilant against potentially harmful anti-competitive conduct by those who may seek to take advantage of consumers and businesses during these extraordinary circumstances,\" said the statement issued by Commissioner Matthew Boswell. Boswell said the bureau wouldn't hesitate to crack down on misleading advertising and would hold companies accountable for any instances of collaboration to fix prices — what's known as collusion. Boswell declined an interview request but said consumers can contact his office with complaints. Bureau spokesperson Jean-Philippe Lepage confirmed the competition watchdog has received some COVID-19-related complaints already, but wouldn't say how many.

Aside from stopping pricing cartels, there's little else the Competition Bureau can do. Nothing stops a producer or retailer from raising prices on their own, said Oliver Borgers, a competition lawyer with McCarthy Tétrault.   \"A price surge as a result of natural market forces is not something that is regulated by Canadian competition laws or otherwise,\" he said.

(Evan Mitsui/CBC) Governments have sweeping 'emergency powers' Several provinces have declared states of emergency. Such declarations give provincial governments the power to regulate property and civil rights. Many provinces now have the right to control the prices of essential services. Ontario Premier Doug Ford hinted at this during a press conference Wednesday, addressing concerns over price surges. \"These people are going to be held accountable on social media,\" Ford said. \"And when we get over it — because we'll get over this — they'll be held accountable by the people of Ontario ... the government will hold them accountable as well.\"  John Lawford, executive director and general counsel of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, also said the federal Emergencies Act gives Ottawa the power to influence prices by controlling the distribution and availability of goods and services. \"They could take over businesses and frankly run them from the federal government level,\ " Lawford said. \"Basically, the federal government could nationalize industries.

Federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough joined the briefing by health officials to announce how many Canadians have applied for the government's Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).   She said just over 750,000 new applications were filed on Tuesday alone, for a total of 1.72 million since Monday, when people born in January, February and March were asked to start applying.

More help on the way for youth, businesses taking financial hit from COVID-19 : PM  Alberta and Quebec released grim projections on Tuesday for the human cost the coronavirus outbreak could exact on each province, with Premier Jason Kenney suggesting Alberta won't be able to start relaxing physical distancing measures until the end of May. Public health officials in Quebec projected that between 1,200 and 9,000 people there could die from COVID-19 by the end of the month. Following an afternoon announcement, the officials hastened to add that the projections were based on countries which were slow to act, and that the province is trending toward the lower end of projections.

Later Tuesday evening, Kenney said his province's \"probable scenario\" modelling showed the virus could kill between 400 and 3,100 people in Alberta by the end of summer, while the \"elevated\" numbers suggested as many as 6,600 could die in the same time frame. The premier warned the province could see as many as 800,000 infections during that period. But he added, \"These numbers are not a done deal.\" Instead, Kenney said he wants Albertans to see them as a challenge to work harder to slow the rate of infection.   Calling it \"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation,\ " he laid out a plan to deal with saving lives and rebuilding the economy.    Canada to produce 30,000 ventilators Earlier Tuesday, Trudeau announced Ottawa is working with companies to try to produce 30,000 ventilators. He said the country's hospitals' ability to treat COVID-19 depends directly on a \"sustainable, stable supply,\" of critical products. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Trudeau said Canada will partner with manufacturers, including Thornhill Medical, CAE  and a group led by StarFish Medical, to produce 30,000 of the machines, which are critical for those suffering from the worst effects of the illness.

In most cases, it causes mild to moderate symptoms, but for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe disease and lead to death. Health officials around the world have urgently called on people to stay physically apart and practise proper hand hygiene in a push to slow the spread — or flatten the curve — of the disease.

Under the most likely scenario, first revealed by Premier Jason Kenney in a televised address on Tuesday, Alberta would see as many as 800,000 confirmed and suspected infections and between 400 to 3,100 deaths by the end of the summer. The peak in cases is projected to occur in the middle of May. Under that scenario, the peak of hospitalization would be in late May, with about 818 Albertans requiring hospitalization. About 232 patients would be expected to require critical care by late May and early June. \"Modelling is an estimate based on the best known data at the time that the model is put together,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. \"But we will continue to adjust it based on emerging Alberta data and evidence. So you will ... see this model evolving over time.\" Albertans can help bring the numbers down further by following public health rules aimed at preventing spread of the virus, she added.   \"Changing our total infections in the province is in our hands,\ " Hinshaw said. \"Every action makes a difference.\"   The province updated its COVID-19 case numbers before the start of the news conference. Alberta reported 50 new cases Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 1,423. Three more deaths were reported, bringing the total so far to 29. There have been 519 recoveries. Ramping up health-system response As a precaution, Alberta is ramping up its ICU, ventilator and personal protective equipment capacity based on an elevated, but less likely scenario.   Under the elevated scenario, 1,570 Albertans would require hospital beds by the beginning of May, with 392 of those cases requiring intensive care.   The elevated model would see as many as one million infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. System couldn't handle 'extreme' scenario An extreme model, with 1.6 million infections and 16,000 to 32,000 total deaths was provided to show how the virus would have spread if Alberta had not taken mitigation measures like closing businesses, schools and public buildings, and encouraging people to stay home. Alberta's health system would not be able to handle this scenario.    The information released on Wednesday outlines the assumptions used by health officials to come up with their models.   The most likely scenario includes an assumption that each person with COVID-19 will infect one to two other people. Other assumptions include that not all cases will be detected, that there is no asymptomatic transmission, and that patients are infectious for 5 to 10 days.   For the purposes of health system planning, the scenarios assume all ICU patients will need the use of a ventilator and that generally, 14 per cent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, with five per cent needing time in intensive care.   Unlike other jurisdictions that have used data from other places to project the spread of the virus, Alberta is using data gathered through its own testing and surveillance. Officials say the models are fluid and will change as new information comes in. More ICU beds ready by late April Alberta plans to have an additional 1,081 ICU beds ready by the end of April, and another 447 ventilators, bringing the total number of ventilators set aside for COVID-19 patients from 314 to 761. The additional ventilators are coming from a number of sources, including the respiratory therapy programs at NAIT and SAIT, STARS air ambulance, private surgical facilities and the Public Health Agency of Canada.   Transport, anaesthetic and pediatric devices that can be used for mechanical ventilation account for another 305 units; another 65 are new purchases by the province.   The stock of personal protective equipment is more than sufficient through to the end of April and into May. Alberta Health Services is showing shortages for the month of June, but officials say that doesn't account for the orders expected to be filled by then.    The province is adding an additional 315 acute care beds by the end of April by measures which include postponing non-urgent procedures. Alberta Health Services intends to increase staffing in the ICU by ramping up training for nurses, hiring recently retired health care workers, and moving nurse graduates through their practicums so they can start working. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the government should be planning for a worst-case scenario and she repeated her call for the government to take over staffing of seniors' homes, and prevent employees from working at more than one site.   Notley is also concerned of reports from health-care workers that they are being encouraged to wash and reuse their N95 masks.   \"There's a shortage, we need to start being honest about that,\ " she said.   While AHS believes it has enough supply of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), AHS CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said they also have to be careful. Yiu said the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommendations for sterilization and reuse of N95 masks.   Kenney has asked AHS to \"go as big as they can\" in procuring supplies.  He said Alberta is prepared to share with other provinces if they get more PPE than required.   ' I hope the models are wrong' In an address to Albertans on Tuesday evening, Kenney outlined two possible scenarios for the pandemic in Alberta. Modelling suggests as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections could sweep Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney says OPINION | Kenney delivers a stark but necessary message to Albertans Under the \"probable\" scenario, Alberta would hit the peak of infections in mid-May. From the beginning of the outbreak to the end of summer the province could see up to 800,000 total infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths. Under a more serious but less likely \"elevated\" scenario, infections in Alberta would peak at the beginning of May, with as many as one million total infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. In his widely watched Tuesday address, Kenney said public health orders designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus may have to stay in place until the end of May. \"As hard as this will be, it is the only ethical choice when thousands of lives are still at stake,\ " Kenney said. \"To be honest, I hope the models are wrong.\ "
  Alberta health officials and doctors continue to work behind the scenes to prepare for any potential cases of COVID-19, the name scientists have given to the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta. But a spike in international cases — mostly in China — has pushed the number of people confirmed to have COVID-19 above 59,000. The death toll now sits at more than 1,300 worldwide. At the Crowfoot Village Family Practice in northwest Calgary, posters featuring red stop signs warn patients who have a new cough and are feeling sick to don a mask for the duration of their visit. Boxes of surgical masks can be found on the counter at the reception desk. Signs reminding patients to put on a mask if they have a cough and are feeling sick are posted at the Crowfoot Village Family Practice. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Staff have been given a refresher on infection control, and the supply room is stocked with supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer and isolation protection kits. The kits include gowns, masks and other disposable equipment. \"For us, this is not unlike how we get ready for regular flu season,\" said the clinic's medical director and family doctor, Dr. Janet Reynolds. She has been monitoring regular updates on COVID-19 from various organizations, including Alberta Health Services. \"If patients come in with a fever, cough, cold, we ask them to put a mask on when they come to reception and try to put them directly into an exam room so that they're not potentially spreading their infection to other vulnerable patients.\" Patients who have a cough and are feeling unwell are asked to wear a mask for the duration of their appointment. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) A key difference, though, is staff are asking about a  patient's travel history, since that is one of the criteria that would trigger concerns about potential exposure to the novel coronavirus. According to Reynolds, while they've received phone calls from people — who have either travelled to China or have been exposed to someone who has and are worried about COVID-19 — they have yet to see any patients in the office with symptoms and a travel history warranting testing. She says people who call in and are feeling unwell are encouraged to stay home. In some cases, they're being prompted to call Health Link, the province's health advice and information line (dial 811). 811 calls coming in In the past week , Health Link has received an average 40-50 calls per day related to the novel coronavirus, out of a daily total ranging from 1,800 to 2,000 calls. The latest numbers released by Alberta Health, updated on Feb. 7, show 28 Albertans have been tested for the illness and all tests have come back negative. \"I think we're at a really critical point right now, globally, and I think that is relevant to Alberta,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.   Supplies of masks, gloves and isolation gowns at Crowfoot Village Family Practice. The clinic's medical director says they've had no trouble obtaining supplies. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) According to Hinshaw, the risk to Alberta continues to be low and the next few weeks will be pivotal in terms of containing the illness. \"I think it's too early to declare it one way or another. But again, the current risk in Alberta remains low. … We continue to do a lot of work on screening people and supporting people who are staying home, and also if there are people who are symptomatic, making sure that they get appropriate testing and advice,\ " she said. Work is going on behind the scenes to prepare for any cases that may show up in this province. Hinshaw says there are stockpiles of medical supplies that can be moved around the province as needed. \"At the moment, it's business as usual on the front lines and in the background making sure that there are extra supplies if we should need them.\ " In January, the province worked to secure extra supplies including surgical masks and specialized N95 respirator masks that are required for procedures where there is a risk that tiny droplets containing the virus could become airborne. That includes CPR,  intubation (where a tube is inserted to help a person breathe) and the use of nebulizers, which give a patient medication in the form of a mist through a mask. \"There was an extra order put in for additional personal protective equipment just in case it's needed — just out of an abundance of caution,\ " she said.   The clinic has medical supplies, including infection prevention kits, in the event that potential cases of the novel coronavirus show up. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Alberta  Health says that order was placed early in an effort to avoid any potential shortages and it has already been received.  But officials won't speculate on how long those supplies could last or how many people could be treated with the additional stock. In an email to CBC News, a government spokesperson said \"it would depend on a wide range of factors. However, health officials continually evaluate and assess the province's stockpile of medical supplies and equipment, and will continue to do so. …  While we're acting out of an abundance of caution, we do not expect that extra supplies will be needed in the immediate future.\" Front-line health staff have also been given detailed instructions and updates on how to use infection control equipment and what type of equipment is required and when. 
  With shortages of masks, gloves and testing kits hampering the fight against the coronavirus in Canada, there is one important weapon that remains unused — rapid blood tests that will tell within 15 minutes if someone has been exposed. These tests cannot detect early infections because the body's immune system hasn't had time to produce antibodies against the virus.  But about five to seven days after symptoms show up, they could be used to determine who has been infected and who has not — which would provide a more accurate picture of Canada's epidemic, including identifying people who were asymptomatic or had only mild infections. The rapid blood tests are already being used in Europe, Asia, Australia and the U.S. Some academic laboratories are also developing COVID blood tests. But so far none of those tests has been approved for use in Canada. One company, BTNX Inc., in Markham, Ont., is shipping thousands of rapid tests to hospitals in the U.S.    INTERACTIVE  | Tracking the number of coronavirus cases in Canada   Mitchell Pittaway, the company's chief financial officer, said he would rather be distributing the tests in Canada. \"The response [from Health Canada] has been a bit longer than what we would have liked to have seen,\ " Pittaway said. \"The U.S. has been much quicker.\ " Similar to blood glucose test This week his company shipped 20,000 tests to U.S. hospitals. It will be sending another 200,000 to the U.S. next week. \"As a Canadian company with Canadian staff, ideally we would love to have all of this capacity blocked off for Canada, but we're not able to step back and not address needs coming from other countries.\" BTNX Inc., in Markham, Ont. , is one of several companies awaiting approval of rapid blood testing technology in Canada. Meanwhile, BTNX is shipping thousands of its tests to hospitals in the U.S., where approval was fast-tracked. (BTNX Inc.) The test kit sells for about $10 US and it uses a simple finger-prick of blood to reveal whether someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"It's similar to a blood glucose test,\" said Pittaway. \"Put a droplet of blood in the sample well, followed by two droplets of buffer, and after 15 minutes there will be a reaction.\ " That's if the person has been infected with COVID-19. There will be no red lines on the test paper if there are no antibodies detected in the blood. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada? The company reports that the test is highly sensitive and specific for the COVID-19 virus, but does not recommend it as stand-alone confirmation of an infection, and the test can be complicated if a person has been infected by milder coronavirus strains. Still, Pittaway said the test could help reduce the current strain on the laboratory testing system by prioritizing anyone who gets a positive result on the blood test. Health Canada reviewing There is a risk of false positives and false negatives with any test. That's one reason Health Canada is taking a close look at the rapid blood tests before approving them for use in Canada \"The department is working with the National Microbiology Laboratory to validate testing and research, along with expert advice, so that we can have confidence in the test results,\ " Health Canada spokesperson Geoffroy Legault-Thivierge said in an email. CBC ExplainsWhat you need to know about the new COVID-19 emergency wage subsidy In the U.S., the FDA is is allowing the test kits to be sold for use by health care professionals only. \"And that's the same as we're pursuing in Canada,\" said Pittaway There are more than a dozen companies ready with blood tests and waiting for Health Canada to give them the go-ahead. \"Our application to Health Canada was submitted and under review,\" Bryan Fang, a spokesperson for Healgen Scientific said in an email. \"Health Canada will release the information once it is approved.\" An illustration of Healgen Scientific's rapid COVID-19 blood test, which has been approved for use in the U.K., France and Italy, and is awaiting approval in Canada. (Healgen Scientific) Fang said his company received European approval back in February to supply a rapid COVID-19 test to the U.K., France and Italy.   \"We are increasing our capacity every day,\ " Fang said Wednesday. \"As of today, we can make 500-600K per day.\ " Swab test kits prioritized Two weeks ago, Canada's health minister signed an interim order to speed up approvals for COVID-19 tests and other medical devices. Rapid blood tests are being considered under that order \"These tests are also being accepted for review; however, the World Health Organization does not currently recommend serological tests for clinical diagnosis, and Health Canada is following this advice,\" said Legault-Thivierge, adding that Health Canada officials are giving the traditional PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing kits priority under the interim order. The laboratory-based PCR test, like the one pictured, is the only one that can detect an infection in the early stages, using a nasal swab inserted into a patient's nose. (Evan Tsuyoshi Mitsui/CBC) The laboratory-based PCR test is the only one that can detect an infection in the early stages, using a nasal swab inserted into a patient's nose. That sample is sent to a hospital or provincial lab, where specialized machines try to detect the virus's genetic material. But a cross-Canada shortage of testing kits, machines and trained laboratory staff means many COVID-19 cases are being missed, and provincial case counts are underestimating the extent of the epidemic in Canada. People are still shocked to learn that they might not be tested despite having symptoms or being in close contact with someone who is infected. Even in nursing homes with active COVID-19 outbreaks, Ontario is still only testing people with symptoms. CBC InvestigatesChiropractors chided for claims of boosting immunity and preventing COVID-19   Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Toronto's Sinai Health Systems, told CBC Toronto's Mike Crawley that everyone in an affected long-term care facility should be tested. \"That's important so that we don't miss cases that could allow us to further spread this virus around and potentially kill more people,\ " he said. Across Canada, researchers are scrambling to increase PCR testing capacity. At the University of Toronto, Keith Pardee is developing a portable test system that uses different chemicals than the ones currently running short. His test is not yet approved for use, but he hopes to have patient trials completed by early next month. At the University of Calgary, Dr. Dylan Pillai is developing another alternative to the PCR test that would also be portable and use different chemicals. He said he could be ready within two weeks to help take the load off the laboratories. \"We have a working assay already developed and we're just in the process of validating that,\ " he said. With new research suggesting there could be a substantial number of people infected without showing any symptoms, experts are increasingly recommending the use of population-wide rapid blood tests as an important tool in the process of returning to normal. The blood tests will reveal how many people have already been exposed, and could therefore be expected to have at least some short-term immunity to the virus. 
  Two passengers have died on the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship Coral Princess, which docked Saturday morning in Miami. There are 1,020 passengers and 878 crew members aboard the Princess Cruises ship, which set sail on March 5 for a South American cruise. Ninety-seven of the passengers and two of the crew members are Canadian.   \"All of us at Princess Cruises are deeply saddened to report that two guests passed away on Coral Princess,\" spokesperson Alivia Owyoung Ender said in an email.  \"Our hearts go out to their family, friends and all who are impacted by this loss.\" She didn't reveal how the two passengers died, but said they weren't Canadian.  On Thursday, the cruise line announced that, out of 13 people tested for COVID-19 on board, seven passengers and five crew members tested positive.   In late March, Holland America Line's Zaandam cruise ship also had a coronavirus outbreak and four people on board died. At least two of the deaths were related to the virus.   Frank Béchamp and wife, Céline Charette, on the Coral Princess, before they were told to stay confined to their cabins following a COVID-19 outbreak on board.   (Submitted by Frank Béchamp) Coral Princess passenger Frank Béchamp, 71, said the ship's captain delivered the news about the two deaths on that ship early Saturday morning, before reaching Miami.   \"My wife and I, we just were dumbfounded. We didn't know what to think,\" said Béchamp, of Ottawa, who's travelling with his wife, Céline Charette. \"Our hearts went out to the poor families that are stricken. It must be terrible for them.\ " Béchamp said the captain reported that the two individuals died overnight. He said passengers were told to pack their bags because the ship would soon dock.   Passengers remain on ship   According to a memo sent to passengers Saturday morning, they must undergo a health screening and go through customs at Port Miami and then return to the Coral Princess.   Princess Cruises said the disembarkation of passengers could take several days and those requiring medical treatment will be let off first. It also said that ill passengers not in need of urgent care will remain on the ship until they're cleared for travel.   Canadian passengers on virus-stricken Coral Princess cruise ship worry how they'll get home The cruise line said that passengers fit to travel will eventually be taken to the airport for arranged flights home.   \"Our concern remains getting direct flights home, avoiding transiting in U.S. airports,\" said passenger Gary Lyon, 64, of Toronto who's travelling with his wife, Sue. \"Sue and l were profoundly sad to hear the news,\" said Lyon in an email. \"We wonder if [passengers] had been able to get off the ship earlier, would things have turned out differently?\" Gary Lyon and wife, Sue , during an exursion on their cruise in Ushuaia, Argentina,  before Princess Cruises ended the cruise early.   (Submitted by Gary Lyon) The Coral Princess cut its cruise short in mid-March amid the growing COVID-19 pandemic. But the ship struggled to find a port to let passengers disembark and return home after countries close by, such as Argentina and Brazil, shut their borders to foreigners. Many passengers — including some Canadians — were able to disembark on March 19 in Buenos Aires to catch a flight home. But other passengers who had a flight departing the following day stayed on the ship — and then were stuck there after Argentina decided to close its borders to foreigners at midnight. \"After that, it became a nightmare,\" said Béchamp about the cruise. \"Nobody wanted to have us.\" Ship must have a plan After failing to secure access to a South American port, the Coral Princess set course for Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. On Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard issued an order temporarily blocking the ship from entering U.S. waters due to the COVID-19 cases on board.   \"Based on the hazardous conditions on board your vessel, I have determined your vessel poses an unacceptable risk,\" said the Coast Guard in a statement. Before Coral Princess could disembark passengers at a U.S. port, the ship would have to come up with a plan that ensured ill passengers are safely treated without imposing any risks, stated the Coast Guard.   The ship was set to dock at Port Everglades on Saturday, but changed its plans on Friday to head to Miami instead.   Zaandam cruise ship passengers Chris and Anna Joiner send a message to the Canadian government last week asking for help while stuck on board a cruise ship with four deaths. The ship disembarked passengers in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday.   (Submitted by Chris Joiner) Earlier this week, Holland American's Zaandam cruise ship was also set to dock and disembark passengers at Port Everglades, but faced opposition from local officials, because there were still many passengers on board sick with COVID-19.   After U.S. President Donald Trump intervened by making a case on compassionate grounds, the Zaandam was allowed to dock at Port Everglades on Thursday.   ' This has been a nightmare': Canadian passengers on virus-stricken cruise finally headed for home4 passengers die on stranded cruise ship carrying 247 Canadians Both Princess Cruises and Holland America are owned by Carnival Corporation. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Zaandam and four Princess cruise ships — the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess, the Ruby Princess and the Coral Princess — have had coronavirus outbreaks. As a result of those outbreaks, at least 13 people have died and more than 900 passengers have contracted COVID-19. 
  New Brunswickers could have their COVID-19 test results within 45 minutes instead of waiting up to two days, starting as early as next week  — provided the province doesn't run out of testing supplies. The Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation's COVID-19 emergency fund is paying for lab upgrades at seven hospitals across the province, which will enable them to analyze tests taken within their communities, said Dr. John Dornan, the Horizon Health Network's chief of staff. Until now, all New Brunswick test swabs have been driven in batches to the lab at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton. Adding GeneXpert instruments to Horizon and Vitalité hospitals in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John will have \"tremendous ramifications,\" said Dornan. Instead of people having to wait between 24 and 48 hours in a COVID-19 unit at a hospital or while self-isolating at home, they will know their results in less than one hour. Poor supply of COVID-19 test kits restrained testing, but province still running outN.B. COVID-19 roundup: Province could run out of test supplies within 1 week \"This is great news for patients, but also a critical improvement when testing our health-care staff,\ " he said.   \"We will now know in 45 minutes whether we need to send staff home or if they can carry on providing the excellent care they do everyday.\" New Brunswick has 91 cases of COVID-19, as of Thursday afternoon, when 10 new cases were announced. Three people remain in hospital, including the first case in intensive care. The province's testing capacity will be \"huge\" once the labs are up and running, likely within a couple of weeks, said Dornan. And the timing \"couldn't be better,\ " he said. It will coincide with a planned ramp-up in testing. \"The whole successes in other parts of the world were done with significant increases in testing when required. We're going to need that in the not too distant future.\" Premier Blaine Higgs said he plans to release COVID-19 projections for New Brunswick in a week. (CBC) On Thursday night, Premier Blaine Higgs told CBC's Power and Politics that New Brunswick could run out of COVID-19 testing supplies within a week with ramped up testing and personal protective equipment within three or four weeks. \"But we have orders that are pending and hoping to arrive,\ " he said. The Moncton lab is conducting about 500 tests a day but has the capacity to perform up to 1,000 tests a day, Higgs said. \"Granted, if we went to 1,000 tests a day we would be looking at supplies needed within about five days,\" the premier said. Testing may target those without symptoms Dornan could not immediately say whether the newly upgraded labs will analyze swabs like the Moncton lab, sputum samples  \"or some other means.\ " But he did say he expects the labs will start testing people in the community who \"might not have very typical symptoms.\ " \"Thus far, we believe that the vast majority of people that have the disease when they're tested have some degree of symptoms,\ " he said. \"But we are worried that when it is more rampant in the community then, you know, is it possible that people will start shedding virus and be asymptomatic?\" Other targeted groups for testing will include people living in homes for seniors and assisted-living facilities, who are considered \"at risk.\ " Dr. John Dornan says seven sites will get an upgrade to determine COVID-19 results much faster, thanks to funding from the Saint John Hospital Foundation. The Foundation is also buying two higher level life support machines known as ECMO. 8:39 New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell called the lab upgrades \"a very positive development.\" \"We're looking at rolling that out late next week, perhaps Thursday,\" she said. The capacity of the labs will vary, Russell said, with the smaller centres expected to handle about 16 test results a day and the larger ones, about 84 daily. The software upgrades and components for existing equipment at the seven labs will cost $525,000, according to the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation. Buying 2 lung machines The foundation is also purchasing two machines to help with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, lung capacity and function can be severely affected. The two portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support systems machines oxygenate the blood, allowing the lungs to rest. The premier thanked the foundation for the donation of the life-saving equipment. It is \"just one example of how the people in this province are coming together to support one another,\ " Higgs said. The total cost of the two ECMO machines is $137,500, the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation said. The foundation's emergency fund, established to be used for areas of greatest need in the province during the pandemic, has seen donations of more than $1.1 million over two weeks. Of that, $1 million was donated by the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation. 
  How COVID-19 progresses from incubation to recovery has implications for everything from how long people may spread it before showing symptoms, to how long people can be expected to occupy resources such as ICU beds and ventilators in hospitals.   Here's a closer look at what has been learned about how symptoms develop from international studies and interviews with front-line doctors. Note that the averages represent typical cases, and there tends to be a wide range at all stages of the disease.   Incubation period The period in which a person is infected but shows no symptoms appears to average around five to six days, although it can vary from one to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization and Chinese data. Because people without symptoms aren't usually tested, positive tests typically represent infections that happened on average five days and up to two weeks earlier. Studies also suggest people with no symptoms or mild symptoms are responsible for most of the spread. Mild to moderate symptoms Even those who go on to experience more severe symptoms typically begin with mild symptoms, most often fever and a dry cough, although they can also include more unusual symptoms such as loss of taste and smell. Symptoms will remain mild in about 80 per cent of cases, the WHO says, and recovery takes about two weeks in mild cases. Typically, the cough lasts a week longer than the fever, a Chinese study found. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are told to recover at home. A key, more severe symptom that sometimes leads to hospitalization is shortness of breath or dyspnea, which shows up on average five to six days after symptoms began, Chinese researchers reported in medical journals JAMA and The Lancet. For more details, read these personal accounts of what it's like to have a milder case of COVID-19 from Kym Murphy of Saint John, N.B., David Anzarouth of Toronto and Todd Rowan of Saskatoon.   (CBC News) Hospitalization Studies in China and the U.S suggest that most patients who are hospitalized are admitted, on average, about a week after symptoms begin. In Canada, patients appear to be sickest at about that time, said Dr. Bram Rochwerg, site lead at the Juravinski Hospital intensive care unit in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University. However, other studies show wide variations in when patients are hospitalized —  the average time from symptom onset varied from 1.5 days in one Chinese study to 11 days in another.   The rate at which people are hospitalized and admitted to ICU and how long they spend there can vary from country to country. It's not the number of COVID-19 patients posing a challenge for ICUs — it's how long they staySecond OpinionWhy COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think Rochwerg said that timing depends partly on criteria for hospitalization. Some hospitals in China admitted most patients who showed up, while many hospitals in the U.S. and Canada have been more restrictive, sending patients home unless their symptoms are severe. Two Chinese studies found that patients who are hospitalized in general wards typically stayed for an average of 10 or 12 days. Those who died in general wards tended to do so in about the same amount of time, the same studies found. WATCH | COVID-19 patient 'would beg' Canadians to listen to top doctors: B.C. resident Erin Leigh, 38, is recovering from the novel coronavirus in hospital. She told CBC News she had never experienced an illness like COVID-19. 7:00 ICU admission and stay A key symptom that often leads to ICU admission is acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. That is lung inflammation and fluid build-up in the lungs that stops air from getting in and causes blood oxygen levels to drop. Acute respiratory distress syndrome typically requires life support such as mechanical ventilation that must be administered in the ICU. The onset of ARDS has been reported to average eight or 11 days after symptoms begin (about one to three days after hospital admission) in Chinese studies in JAMA and The Lancet.  ICU admission typically follows within two days. Rochwerg said at his hospital in Hamilton it's not unusual for patients with ARDS to be admitted straight from the emergency room into the ICU. ARDS is part of an exaggerated immune response called a \"cytokine storm,\" that can also lead to complications such as acute kidney damage.   This chart, based on a study of hospitalized patients in China, shows the progression of symptoms and major interventions over the course of the disease for those who survived the illness and those who did not. (Fei Zhou/The Lancet/Elsevier) Very sick patients died on average four or five days after being admitted to ICU, Chinese studies found. In Italy, patients averaged seven days in the ICU before death. Those who eventually recovered spent longer in the ICU, averaging eight, nine and 14 days in studies from China, Italy and the U.S. respectively.  There's a wide variation. Dr. Rob Fowler, chief of Sunnybrook Hospital's trauma and critical-care program in Toronto, told CBC News earlier in April that dozens of COVID-19 patients have come through his ICU and required care lasting for \"many, many days to many, many weeks.\" UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear themCBC InvestigatesSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 Ontario ICU beds Rochwerg noted that while the virus is the trigger, it's actually the body's own response that generates severe complications, such as ARDS. \"That's the reason they stay critically ill for five days, a week, two weeks,\ " he said. That's much longer than the three days spent in ICU by average critically ill patients without COVID-19. This is why experts say COVID-19 patients tend to accumulate in ICUs and the pandemic poses such a challenge for health systems. Paramedics transfer a patient from an ambulance into the LaSalle Hospital in Montreal on April 25, as COVID-19 cases rise in Canada and around the world.   (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press) Post-ICU recovery Most studies didn't describe how long patients spent recovering in hospital after leaving the ICU. However, Dr. Kenneth Lyn-Kew, an associate professor of pulmonology and critical care medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver, told Scientific American that it can take two days to two weeks. CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? Rochwerg said patients typically discharged from the ICU spend at least as much time as they spent in the ICU recovering in general hospital wards, if not more. \"But everyone is different.\ "  Some, he said, may even require extensive rehab or long-term care afterward. 
  As cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, increase in Manitoba and across Canada, testing has emerged as a focal point for public health workers and the public. Thousands of Manitobans have been tested since the global pandemic began, although the province is not currently offering mass testing. Here's a look at how testing works in the province, for those who meet the criteria. Step 1: Self-screening This is where all testing in Manitoba has to start. Right now, Manitoba is not conducting mass testing — which means you'll need a referral before you'll be tested. Testing was initially offered to symptomatic people who have travelled internationally or have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. On Thursday, the province announced expanded criteria to include symptomatic health-care workers and symptomatic people living in remote communities, First Nations or group settings (like jails, shelters, long-term care homes and remote work camps). Tests are also being done on ICU patients with respiratory issues and any samples collected from patients for respiratory concerns. For now, the referral needs to come from Health Links — Info Santé. But before you call them, you can do an assessment on your own to see if you should. You can self-assess in two ways : online (find that tool here) or over the phone with an automated voice response tool (call 1-877-308-9038). Both tools will ask you a series of questions about your symptoms and exposure/travel history. At the end, they'll tell you if you need to contact Health Links. Step 2: Health Links Once you've self-assessed, you can call Health Links at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. The service is open 24/7. Health Links has quadrupled its staffing in recent weeks to respond to the huge spike in calls since the pandemic began, including bringing in nursing students to help staff the lines. Once you get through to them, you're likely to face a wait —but the increased staffing, along with the introduction of coronavirus-only lines, have brought the wait down significantly since the outbreak began. Once you get through, a screener on the other end of the phone will ask you a series of questions similar to what's included in the online self-screening tool. At the end, they'll tell you if you need to get tested at your local testing site (there are 12 in Manitoba, as of Wednesday) or self-monitor for symptoms. If you do need to be tested, the screeners at Health Links inform Manitoba Public Health and phone or fax test sites to let them know to expect you. Step 3: Test sites When you get your referral, Health Links will use your postal code to figure out exactly where you need to go. If you show up at a test site but don't meet the criteria for testing, you'll be sent home. As of Wednesday, there are 12 dedicated testing sites in Manitoba: five in Winnipeg and one each in Thompson, Flin Flon, The Pas, Steinbach, Selkirk, Brandon and Winkler with plans for more in the works. Five of the sites are drive-thru, and you can get swabbed without leaving the car. Vehicles line up Thursday at the COVID-19 drive-thru test site in Selkirk, Man. (Ron Boileau/Radio-Canada ) If you go to one that's not a drive-thru, you'll be asked to wait in a separate waiting room from any non-COVID-19 clientele at the centre. Here are the testing sites in Winnipeg:   Access Winnipeg West (280 Booth Dr.). Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.). Access Transcona  (845 Regent Ave. W.). Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.). Manitoba Public Insurance Bison Drive Service Centre (15 Barnes St.) — drive-thru site.   And the ones outside the city:  Thompson: Thompson Clinic in Thompson Plaza Mall at 50 Selkirk Ave. Flin Flon: Channing Auditorium in the Flin Flon Community Hall, 2 North Ave. The Pas: Royal Canadian Legion, 4 Veterans Way — new address after relocation. Brandon : Nurses' Residence Gym in the Brandon Regional Health Centre at 150 McTavish Ave. E. Selkirk: 622 Superior Ave.  — drive-thru site. Steinbach: Steinbach Community Services building at 365 Reimer Ave.  — drive-thru site. Winkler: Winkler Centennial Arena at 600 Park St. — drive-thru site. Eriksdale: Eriksdale Wellness Centre, 35 Railway Ave.  — drive-thru site. Portage la Prairie: Stride Centre, 245 Royal Rd.  — drive-thru site. Dauphin: MPI Service Centre, 271 Industrial Rd.  — drive-thru site. Pine Falls: École Powerview School, 33 Vincent St.   If you live far away from any testing site, you'll be instructed to call ahead to your nearest health-care centre so staff there can prepare for your arrival and test you. Waits were long, at first, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health, but have dropped since. Now, most patients are told to expect to wait under an hour — but that varies based on where you are and when you go. Waiting rooms have been redesigned so people can social distance while in there. They get cleaned regularly and you'll be given a mask to wear until you're called to get swabbed. Step 4: Swab In general, you're going to be in the testing room for about 15 minutes. Only roughly 30 seconds of that will be spent on the actual test itself. The rest is a brief assessment from the nurse, nurse practitioner or doctor who will administer the test, followed by instructions on how to self-isolate. The test works like this: a health-care worker will use a nasopharyngeal swab (picture a very long, skinny Q-tip) deep into your nose. WATCH | Health-care worker demonstrates COVID-19 swab A Manitoba health-care worker performs a mock swab for COVID-19 works on a volunteer (not a real patient). Supplied footage for demonstration purposes only. 0:42 Once that's done, the swab gets put into a \"viral medium\" in a small tube and labelled. It's kept cool — between 0 and 4 C — and drivers come by testing sites twice per day to pick up swabs and bring them to Cadham Provincial Laboratory to be processed. For the patient, the waiting game begins now: You'll be sent home and asked to self-isolate until you hear back about your results. Step 5: Testing at Cadham, self-isolation After your swab is sealed up and sent off, it gets delivered to the Cadham lab, where scientists will test it for COVID-19. In addition to swabs taken from patients with symptoms and travel or exposure history, scientists there are also testing samples collected from intensive care unit patients with respiratory symptoms, and all samples collected from patients to be tested for other respiratory issues. Once your swab gets to the lab, it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours to get tested, said chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin.   Cadham has more than 100 staff in total and handles testing and surveillance for communicable diseases ranging from influenza and salmonella to HIV and syphilis. A lot of that work still has to get done during a pandemic, the spokesperson for Shared Health said, although much of it has been moved to other locations. The lab can handle a capacity of roughly 500 COVID-19 tests per day, Health Minister Cameron Friesen has said, although actual testing has dropped in recent days due to a shortage of a reagent used to complete the test. But the lab has found a \"workaround\" for the reagent shortage and has successfully made its own viral transport medium for swabs, Roussin said Wednesday. While waiting for your swab to be tested, you'll have to stay in isolation. (Austin Grabish/CBC) While you're waiting for your results, the province says you have to stay in self-isolation. It encourages you to reach out to your social support network by phone or email to keep your mental health up, and keeping yourself distracted with tasks or hobbies in the meantime. If your test comes out negative at Cadham, you will get contacted, said Manitoba Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa. But it might take longer than if you had tested positively, because health-care workers are prioritizing contacting those people first, she said. Remember that a negative result doesn't get you out of any self-isolation required by travel : If you've been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days after returning from somewhere, you don't get to end it early. Previously, if your test comes out positive, you'd be what's called a \"probable positive\" case, until your test could be confirmed at the National Microbiology Lab. Now, however, Cadham can confirm cases on its own, eliminating the need for second testing at the national lab. If it's positive, you'll get contacted immediately, public health officials say, and health-care workers will get started on \"contact tracing.\ " That means they'll work to figure out everyone you may have come into contact with and infected. Step 6: Follow up If you test positive, you'll be contacted daily by public health workers to follow up with you, including daily monitoring of your symptoms.   So far, four Manitoba cases have been officially marked as \"recovered.\"

Why younger Canadians may be helping fuel spread of COVID-19. Long-term care homes are worrisome COVID-19 hot spots.   A new month means a fresh set of bills for Canadian families and businesses struggling with the health and financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, as officials warn that the emergency and public health measures will likely be in place for some time to come. With case numbers rising, several provinces have made moves to extend orders aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in China and has since spread around the world.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday declined to put a specific timeline on how long strict measures could last, saying they would be in place for a number of weeks — and perhaps months. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Trudeau again reiterated a call on Canadians to respect public health rules and practice physical distancing, saying the behaviour of Canadians has a direct impact on how the health crisis will unfold.

Here's how to make sense of it Some health experts questioning advice against wider use of masks to slow spread of COVID-19 Health minister says Ottawa's stockpile of protective gear likely wasn't enough  Canada's provinces, meanwhile, have been stepping up closure orders and, in many cases, increasing enforcement powers. On Wednesday, Toronto Mayor John Tory said COVID-19 \"numbers are presently heading in the wrong direction\" in Canada's largest city. Tory spoke as the city provided details about a 12-week plan to try and clamp down on the virus's spread. The city's measures include stay-home orders for people with COVID-19 and those who have been in close contact with them, as well as an advisory that people over the age of 70 stay in as much as possible.

Public health authorities in Quebec said there won't be physical checkpoints, but that officers would be stopping people at random to see if their travel was considered essential. Emergency benefit site launching The Trudeau government has announced several programs meant to support families and businesses struggling to pay bills, but there is no firm timeline for when money will start flowing for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or the business support programs. Trudeau said Wednesday that those eligible will be able to apply through an online portal for the CERB beginning April 6, and that people who have already applied for Employment Insurance don't need to apply. Trudeau says starting April 6 you can apply online for the CERB - that's the $2000/month for anyone making 0 income. Direct deposits will be made within 3-5 days, or within 10 days by mail. Applicants will have to confirm once a month that they are out of work.&mdash;@iamSas \"These are the biggest economic measures in our lifetime, to defeat a threat to our health,\" said Trudeau, noting that the government alone can't win the fight. \"We — each of us — have to live up to our end of the bargain. We must fulfil our collective responsibility to each other.\" On Wednesday afternoon, Finance Minister Bill Morneau provided further details around the wage subsidy program. The program will be available to both small and large businesses who have lost significant revenue due to COVID-19, and will cost about $71 billion. Morneau has encouraged businesses to rehire employees they may have laid off in the wake of the outbreak, saying the wage subsidy will be available in six weeks.   Here's what you need to know about the new Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy Like everything else in the pandemic plan, Morneau's economic package is chasing a moving target   Earlier Wednesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had called on the government to do more to help businesses, including cancelling planned tax hikes and refunding GST remittances to small businesses from the last six months.

The current mortgage deferral system isn't working for people the way it should, he said, urging stronger action on that. He also said Ottawa should work with provinces to move toward a pause on rent. When asked about April 1 rent payments, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government is looking at this, as well as discussing the issue with the provinces. She did not provide specifics. \"This is a really big economic challenge and it is a huge health challenge,\ " she said, adding that the federal government structured its work to begin with the life-and-death health issues before moving on to programs meant to help individual Canadians \"weather this economic storm.\" Health-system capacity concerns As of 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, officials in Canada had reported more than 9,700 confirmed and presumptive cases, with 129 deaths. The provinces and territories that are providing details on recovered cases have listed a total of 1,739 as recovered.   There have also been two COVID-19 linked deaths of Canadians outside Canada — one in Japan and one in Brazil. Public health officials have cautioned that reported numbers don't capture the full picture, as there are potential cases that haven't been identified or tested, as well as cases where investigations are ongoing or lab results are not yet in. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Wednesday that there's a real need to expand the health-care system and workforce to handle an expected increase in cases.  She said public health has to work hard to \"suppress this initial curve\" so that the health system doesn't become overwhelmed. Overall, the system is \"coping quite well at the moment,\ " Tam said, but if that changes for the worse, \"some very difficult decisions may have to be made about the prioritization of existing resources.\ " WATCH | Ontario man who contracted COVID-19 released from hospital: The sight of his wife after his experience in hospital gave Rene Segura 'more of a spark to continue.' 3:55 Health Minister Patty Hajdu said health systems weren't designed for this kind of surge, echoing the message that individual actions are \"critically important\" to slowing the spread of the virus. \"We have to all act as if we are carrying this virus,\ " Hajdu said.   A tracking database maintained by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., on Wednesday listed more than 925,000 reported cases worldwide.

Provincially run health systems have been working to ready themselves for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients, but supply of that critical gear is a growing concern. On Wednesday evening, the Ontario Hospital Association said it is \"extremely concerned\" about the shortage of personal protective equipment, particularly masks. \"Ontario hospitals are now at a critical juncture,\ " Anthony Dale, president and CEO of the OHA, said in a statement. He called on Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and their governments \"to work unceasingly to ensure that new supply is provided immediately\" to Ontario hospitals, long-term care facilities and other health-care providers.   In Quebec, Premier François Legault cautioned that supplies were getting tight — with only three to seven days worth of supplies for some equipment. Ontario had sent some gear to assist Quebec in tackling its growing caseload, Legault said. \"We're using 10 times more medical equipment as normal,\" said Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann . \"So what we used in one year, we're using in four weeks.\ "  Wear masks if you want — but keep up the handwashing and physical distancing, say Tam and Hajdu  WATCH | Dr. Theresa Tam addresses whether Canadians should be wearing non-medical masks: Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 Trudeau reiterated Wednesday that the federal government is working closely with provinces to try and meet needs, as well as working internationally to try and get equipment into Canada.  The prime minister didn't offer a specific timeline, saying only that deliveries are expected in the next few days, or perhaps sooner.   Hajdu said Canada has the money and workforce required to get the protective gear and said the country will fight for its share as it becomes available in a competitive market.

It said there were 29,474 confirmed cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning, up from 25,150 the day before. The U.K. government said it would ramp up the number of coronavirus tests amid widespread criticism that it was doing far too few.

France on Wednesday is evacuating 36 patients infected with the coronavirus from the Paris region on board two medicalized high-speed TGV trains. The patients, all treated in intensive-care units, are being transferred to several hospitals in Brittany, as western France is less impacted by the epidemic. The country has already operated several transports of patients by train, helicopter, military aircraft and aboard a navy ship. Some patients from eastern France have also been transferred to hospitals in neighbouring Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland. France has increased its capacity of 5,000 ICU beds before the crisis to 8,000 now and is aiming at getting 14,000 ICU beds in the coming weeks, according to health authorities. Russia completely shut its borders this week and sharply limited the number of flights taking Russians home, leaving thousands stranded abroad. Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said the number of Russians allowed to return will be limited to 700 a day, including 500 in Moscow, due to a limited capacity to properly screen and isolate those arriving. Russia has registered 2,777 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths. Here's a look at what's happening in China, South Korea, Iran and other areas From The Associated Press, updated at 8:00 p.m. ET: China's National Health Commission on Wednesday reported 36 new COVID-19 cases, one day after announcing that asymptomatic cases will now be included in the official count. The commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad, while seven more deaths from the disease had been reported over the previous 24 hours. The commission did not say if any of the new cases were asymptomatic, but on Tuesday reported that, of a total of 1,541 asymptomatic cases now being isolated and monitored for symptoms, 205 had come from overseas. The move to disclose the number of asymptomatic cases comes amid scrutiny of China's reported figures, which previously only included people who exhibited symptoms. While the proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, scientists say these \"carriers\" can still pass COVID-19 on to others who do end up getting sick. Residents wearing face masks pay for groceries Wednesday by standing on chairs to peer over barriers set up around a wet market on a street in Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicentre of China's coronavirus disease outbreak.   (Aly Song/Reuters) As China's domestic outbreak has largely abated, some questioned whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections. China, where the virus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease. A senior official in Serbia's government died from the coronavirus on Wednesday, a health official said. Branislav Blazic, 63, was a state secretary with the Ministry for Environmental Protection, and died only days after being hospitalized with symptoms. Serbia has so far reported 1,060 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 28 deaths, in a total population of 7 million. To curb transmission of the virus, Serbian authorities have declared a state of emergency, shut down all restaurants and cafés, imposed a curfew from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and closed the country's borders. South Korean health officials say 43 patients have been placed under isolation in one of the biggest hospitals in the capital of Seoul after a hospitalized nine-year-old girl tested positive for the coronavirus. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday said around 50 medical staff who worked at the Asan Medical Center's pediatric department will be quarantined at their homes despite having tested negative. Jeong and Seoul city officials said the girl was tested for the virus after doctors found she had previously been treated for a headache at another hospital in Euijeongbu, near Seoul, where a dozen patients and medical staff have been infected with COVID-19. Officials didn't release specific details about the girl's condition.

Hundreds of patients and medical staff have been infected in hospitals in the worst-hit city of Daegu, where more than 6,700 of the country's 9,887 infections have been reported. The Middle East has over 75,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of those in Iran, and over 3,400 deaths. Iran's health ministry spokesperson, Kianoush Jahanpour, said Wednesday that the virus had killed another 138 people, pushing the country's death toll to 3,036 amid 47,593 confirmed cases. Japan has been pushed \"to the brink,\" in its battle against the novel coronavirus, a senior minister said. The country is barring entry to foreigners from 73 countries while the supply of medical services has begun to tighten in some areas. Japan has not yet declared a state of emergency, though infectious disease experts advising the government said that if measures in place now fail to halt secondary and re-infections from overseas, a Plan B would be needed. \"What we can do is to lock down cities or zones, which means more stringent, more harsh control on movement,\" Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura said.   In Iran, conspiracy theories and religious bickering slow COVID-19 response India criticized for not planning for homeless populations in coronavirus lockdown   India had 1,637 active cases and 45 deaths as of Wednesday morning.  India sealed off headquarters of a Muslim missionary group and ordered an investigation into accusations it held religious meetings that officials fear may have infected dozens of people. The Indian government has been criticized for not adequately planning ahead for how it will support the large population of poor and homeless who have lost any means of earning income as a result of the pandemic. India is currently under a three-week lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has deprived an estimated four-million homeless people from earning a living and forced many others to seek refuge in overcrowded shelters.

  Not being able to be with a child at the hospital during an emergency would be a nightmare for any parent. Now imagine having a child admitted to the intensive care unit, with a breathing tube down her throat — and not being able to be with her due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. That's the situation Regina's Chasity Delorme found herself in this past weekend. Her daughter, Jayda Delorme, was diagnosed with epilepsy two years ago — so the family knows what to look out for when she has seizures, and they do not usually need to call an ambulance.   But Chasity Delorme says the seizure Jayda had this past Friday was different.   \"I noticed her behaviour changing. … It usually happens very quickly, so sometimes there's not a lot of time to react,\ " the single mother of three said.   \"I was already fearful of what was actually happening. It wasn't until I got to the hospital that I realized how serious it was.\ " Jayda Delorme, left, goes home with her mother, Chasity, after being hospitalized for three nights in the ICU following multiple life-threatening seizures. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook) Jayda had had a seizure earlier in the week — and  Delorme knew that because of visitor restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, if her daughter needed to be hospitalized, she would not be able to be by her side.   \"The one thing that I fear, happened. And that's what made it even more traumatizing for me,\" Chasity Delorme said.   Jayda was rushed to the hospital, where doctors determined she had suffered multiple seizures.   \"It was traumatic. I couldn't run out of the room to go and stand beside her to hold her hand,\" said Delorme. \"I couldn't be there to talk to the doctors or the nurses and whoever was treating her. I wasn't there to tell them, 'This is not normal.'\ " Jayda said that Friday morning was like any other before the seizure.  She only remembers going in and out of consciousness, with nurses behind a window — but no family around.   \"I couldn't really know what was happening,\" said Jayda.   \"It's weird waking up and … looking at your body and seeing a bunch of bruises and wondering how you got them.\ " Some of Jayda Delorme's photos from her stay in hospital, which she had to do alone because of COVID-19 restrictions. (Jayda Delorme/Facebook ) Delorme said that she eventually got to talk to a social worker and then a doctor, who told her about her daughter's status.   \"The doctor said, 'The positive part of this is that that we stopped the seizures by giving her the breathing tube, because now the oxygen is getting to her brain,\ " she said. \"And that's what saved her life.\ " She was told that if Jayda hadn't been in the hospital, the seizures could have been fatal. Knowing that her daughter could have died — but was saved by the doctor, nurses, and paramedics  — still makes Delorme emotional.   \"That's where the life-saving part comes in, and the devastation,\ " she said. \"Because I had this realization that my daughter's life was just saved, you know? But I couldn't be there now, to help her recover.\" Jayda Delorme's family made these signs for her to see while in the hospital. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook) But Delorme said that the doctor who told her about the seizures had been stopped waited a few moments to tell her more.   \"You could tell he was waiting  … because he knew that my reaction would be even worse.\ "  Jayda had been put into an induced coma, the doctor said, with a breathing tube down her throat, and had been admitted into the intensive care unit at Regina General Hospital. Knowing that her daughter went through all of that — and was now alone at the hospital — left Delorme inconsolable. \"There was no communicating with me at that point. I was hyperventilating. I was having an anxiety attack.\ "  She said the social workers who stepped in were helpful and comforting — from a distance. They could not touch her, or even be near her when they offered her some water, she said — which she understands. \"It was really awkward in that way, but I mean, I knew that they were trying their best, and I could feel their comforting energy, and the disappointment that they couldn't sit beside me,\ " she said.   Jayda Delorme is an artist and high school student.   (Jayda Delorme/Facebook ) \"As her mother, I needed to be close to her, so I would sit in the parking lot, just so I could be close to her,\ " Delorme said. \"I feel like I was her voice, and you know, it was because of this virus … it's taken away an essential piece of her medical care.\ "  Delorme said she was told that because Jayda — who recently turned 18 — is an adult, she could not go into the hospital with her. She understands that technicality, she said, but as a self-described \"helicopter mom\" and \"mama bear,\ " she worries about her three children. \"Even though she is one month into being 18, all my abilities of being the voice of her parent were taken away,\" she said. \"She depends on me in all aspects of her life because she's still learning.\" 'Am I going to see anyone again?' : Hospital patients isolated from loved ones as COVID-19 stops family visitsPremier Moe to address province live on Wednesday night, unveil 'Re-Open' plan ThursdaySupport flowing into northern community of La Loche where outbreak has been recorded at long-term care home Delorme describes her daughter as a talented artist who is caring and loves singing, creating art, and beading.   \"She's always thinking about other people. She's just she's a very talented, and colourful, and soft-spoken at the same time.\ " Since her daughter was in an induced coma, and Delorme could not go into the hospital over the weekend, she decided to do something to show Jayda she was not alone.   She and her two other children, along with a few supporters, made signs and stood outside the hospital in hopes that Jayda could see them.   She did.   Jayda's family show their love to her through messages on signs outside the hospital. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook ) \"I felt lots of comfort just seeing them for the first time,\" said Jayda. \"It helped a lot.\ " She said that although she does not use social media that much, FaceTiming and reading Facebook comments and other messages online have helped her feel less alone. \"It brought lots of comfort and joy, knowing I had all these people by my side.\"  Jayda was allowed to go home three days later, and is now recuperating with her family.   Jayda said it usually takes her a few days to get back to normal after having a seizure, but she is just thankful to be home.   The mother and daughter are thankful for the paramedics that showed up, the doctors, and nurses that helped — but also Native Services at the hospital, who worked as a liaison with the family, checking up on Jayda when Delorme could not.   They even helped Delorme and her family, who are from Cowessess First Nation, find an elder to speak to  — remotely. \"We prayed in the car,\ " Delorme said, while connected by phone to the elder. \"She was like, 'OK, now I'm lighting this smudge, and I'm grabbing my feather, and pray in your way. …' She started praying in our language, and that was the most beautiful part because it was so comforting,\ " Delorme said.   \"So it was a virtual prayer. It was, you know, not the same — but extremely helpful at that moment.\ "
  Almost four times as many Manitobans have now recovered from COVID-19 than are currently known to be infected with the illness, according to the province's latest numbers.  Manitoba's disease curve is getting to be as flat as the Prairies. Those positive signs may hint that a return to some form of normalcy could be just around the bend. But those with chronic health conditions and disabilities face a different reality: most of the six COVID-19-related deaths in Manitoba to date have involved people with pre-existing conditions. That leaves some Manitobans concerned that heading back to the workplace too soon will leave them vulnerable. \"There's definitely some folks out there with really some strong anxiety about returning to work,\" said Neil Johnston, a registered respiratory therapist who is also president and CEO of the Lung Association of Manitoba. Manitobans learned more Wednesday from the provincial government about plans to gradually reopen parts of the economy. Hair salons, dentists, patios can reopen in Manitoba starting MondayManitoba businesses scramble to meet strict rules for reopening MondayNo family 'bubbles': Caution will guide Manitoba's reopening, top doctor says That likely means at employees in what have been designated \"non-essential\" sectors may soon be called back to work. But with the threat of a second-wave of coronavirus rearing its ugly head, as it has in other jurisdictions that relaxed rules, people at risk of suffering the most severe health outcomes have concerns. That includes seniors, immune-compromised individuals, those with heart or lung conditions, and the roughly 20 per cent of Manitobans with breathing issues, Johnston said. \"They may not have confidence in their co-workers,\" he said. \"Are they really following the rules? Are the premises being cleaned properly? If they are going to be providing customer service, are they going to have the proper [personal protective equipment] and physical distance?\" Eager to get back It isn't so much the return to the office that concerns Sharon Evans, the recipient of a double lung transplant. \"I am very anxious to get back to work because being sick, I've been sitting here two and a half years before my transplant, not being able to do anything, and now I am back in that situation again,\ " she said. Sharon Evans, a double lung transplant recipient and legal assistant, says her greatest concern about heading back to work is taking crowded buses. (Submitted by Sharon Evans) Evans, 65, spent a total of three and a half years out of work total due to a lung condition. She had surgery in January 2019, and in February this year she was finally able to ease back into work part-time as a legal assistant at a downtown firm. Weeks later, Manitoba's first COVID-19 cases emerged. Being immuno-suppressed, Evans decided to step away again in mid-March. Shortly thereafter, she and half of her co-workers were laid off as public health orders and closures started to ramp up. Physical distancing requirements raise new and old concerns for Manitobans with disabilities'We feel forgotten' : Disability community overlooked during COVID-19, families say When rules relax again, she's confident her workplace will continue to implement proper physical distancing and sanitizing rules. \"They've been fantastic,\ " she said. It's the bus trips to the office that make her nervous. \"The more people that are going back to work, obviously, the busier the buses are going to get again,\ " she said. \"You've got nurses and doctors and health-cares aides in hospital, and they're the ones that are busting their asses because you decided to go sit on a crowded bus with no face mask.\ " Choosing between 'health and employment' People with disabilities may also face more severe health complications if they do contract COVID-19. That's on the minds of many who may have to go back to work before the threat is completely gone, says the accessibility services co-ordinator with the Manitoba League of Persons with Disabilities. \"We do have a lot of members who are being extra cautious, and the fear with going in to [work] early would be just being more vulnerable,\ " said Rosalie Best, who also has muscular dystrophy and uses a power wheelchair. Second OpinionWhy COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think \"Folks are going to worry [that] if they don't go into work right away if their boss asks, they might lose their job,\ " Best said. \"And for people with disabilities or chronic illnesses it's often not easy to find employment, and so it's kind of choosing between their health and employment.\ " Rosalie Best is accessibility services co-ordinator with the Manitoba League of Persons with Disabilities. (Submitted by Rosalie Best) The United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents thousands of workers in the grocery, hospitality, hotel and restaurant industries, among others, is trying to ensure employees know their rights. \"There's a lot of people undergoing a lot of anxiety and stress at just the thought of going back to work, especially if your job is working with the public,\" said Jeff Traeger, president of UFCW Local 832. \"Employers have to accommodate somebody who has a medical condition or any kinds of workplace restrictions to make sure that they are safe and they're not exposed to a hazard.\" ' Won't take long to spread again' One thing employers can do now is plan to have workplace risk assessments done to help mitigate potential health hazards, he said. Johnston echoed that point. Tuesday was the annual day of mourning for workers who have died, developed illness or been injured on the job, and it serves as a helpful reminder right now, he said. As an example, he pointed to asbestosis, a health condition developed by some construction workers. It's been around for ages and is preventable, yet it persists as a \"major occupational killer,\ " partly due to a failure to follow workplace safety best practices, said Johnston. \"That's an example of being complacent and not following the rules, having an employer who's not really supplying the PPE or the education,\ " he said. \"With COVID-19, this is where we really all have to play our part, because it won't take long to spread again if we're not following the proper procedures.\"
  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states. WATCH | How to wash your hands like a surgeon Can washing your hands really slow the spread of COVID-19? That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said. Mask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more actionHome care workers worry about shortage of protective equipment during pandemic: union \"Those are the masks that you want to consider reprocessing. But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Starting April 1, the public and health-care workers across B.C. will no longer have to pay for parking at hospitals and all other health authority-operated sites.   According to B.C. health minister Adrian Dix, the move is meant to reduce the risk of viral infection from shared parking machines and to encourage social distancing.

Health authorities are also temporarily suspending payroll deductions for parking fees.   \"There are different circumstances at different sites,\" said Dix. \"Many health-care workers, for example, pay off their paycheques for parking, and those deductions will not occur consistent with this policy change.\ " In addition, Vancouver Coastal Health has worked with civic authorities in Vancouver, Richmond and the City of North Vancouver, and are providing unrestricted parking to healthcare workers near hospitals. \"Parking tickets will be waived if staff or physicians get ticketed during a work shift while parking close to Vancouver General Hospital, Richmond Hospital and Lions Gate Hospital,\" said VCH in a release, adding that staff will be given instructions on how to get parking tickets waived.

' This will not be contained': Experts cast doubt that spread of COVID-19 can be stopped The World Health Organization has said the risk of COVID-19 spreading worldwide is now \"very high,\" and officials have suggested that efforts to combat the new coronavirus are still in the containment phase. However, some medical experts believe that the containment stage has long since passed and that the spread of COVID-19 is inevitable. \"This will not be contained, this has not been contained,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital. Massive public health efforts have been helpful in slowing down the virus's spread and reducing the pace and frequency of exported cases from China to the rest of the world, but containment has not worked, he said. In raising the risk level from 'high' to 'very high,' the WHO says it's signalling that countries must be prepared for initial cases of coronavirus.   0:55 Containment may have been possible had there been very early detection of the novel coronavirus and had China imposed massive control initiatives when the scale of the epidemic was much smaller, he said. The challenge is that coronavirus spreads efficiently from human to human, much differently than SARS or MERS, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security. Unlike SARS, where the symptoms were much more severe, a large proportion of individuals that are infected with coronavirus aren't sick enough to seek medical care, a significant factor in containing the virus. \"It's not something that we can prevent from happening in the absence of a vaccine,\ " Adalja said. \"It's not containable in the way that those viruses were.\ " Some experts have suggested the coronavirus will run its course throughout the world and burn itself out, while others believe it will integrate itself into the seasonal viruses that come around every winter, causing clusters of COVID-19.  Read more of this story here.

In brief It is illegal in Canada to pay a surrogate mother.  However, it is legal to reimburse her for pregnancy-related expenses such as additional food, clothing, vitamins and any transportation costs for her medical appointments. In some cases, the transactions are handled using a trust managed by a surrogacy agency. Over the course of a three-month investigation, CBC News spoke with dozens of people involved in surrogacy in Canada; their experiences reveal a burgeoning industry in which agencies lack oversight and mandatory transparency.  Read more on this story here. A surrogate gave birth to Anna Camille Tucci’s baby boy last December. She used a surrogacy agency to help her navigate the process and was left with serious questions about the payments she made. 9:43   Some family members of Canadian veterans suffering from mental health issues linked to their service say the federal government is cutting off their own publicly funded therapy. The crackdown was prompted by the embarrassing revelation almost two years ago that a convicted killer — the son of a former soldier — received PTSD counselling for the murder he committed. As Murray Brewster reports, those family members now want the opportunity to plead their cases before the Commons veterans committee when it reconvenes next month for hearings on the restrictions.  Read more about the fight over mental health counselling here.   When Iranian-born Canadian citizen Farzad Alavi was denied entry to the U.S. on Jan. 10, he said a border officer told him the reason was his past mandatory military service in Iran — which the officer claimed effectively linked him with terrorists.   At the time, Alavi had just suffered a horrific loss. Two days before, his wife, Neda Sadighi, was killed when Iran's military \"unintentionally\" shot down a Ukrainian plane after it took off from Tehran.  Read more about why Alavi claims the U.S. border service's reason for denying him entry is unjust.   Iran, in recent years, has made millions of dollars by taking advantage of its location beside Iraq and near Syria by providing a safe passage for foreign airlines to fly between Europe and Asia or from Asia to other areas of the world.  Iran made more than $100 million a year in overflight fees after the ISIS surge in neighbouring countries. According to several aviation experts, that revenue might have factored into the fateful decision not to shut down Iran's airspace the night Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down.  Read more about how money may have been a factor in the downing of the aircraft.

Maclean was tried for high treason and found \"not guilty, but insane.\"  1916:  Ontario passes a Temperance Act.     1938 : Lutheran pastor Martin Niemoller, who helped found the Confessing Church, is sentenced to seven months in prison for opposing German Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. \"First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist,\ " he said. \"Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.\"  1962:  Philadelphia 76ers centre Wilt Chamberlain scores 100 points in an NBA game against the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pa.   2000:  World and Olympic champion curler Sandra Schmirler dies in Regina of cancer at the age of 36.

  Saskatchewan's sixth COVID-19 victim has been identified by her daughter as 85-year-old Agnes McDonald. McDonald's daughter confirmed the death Thursday and said McDonald died as a result of COVID-19 in La Loche on April 28. McDonald, who would have turned 86 in May, is the sixth COVID-19 death in the province and the second who was a long-term care patient in La Loche. On Sunday, 83-year-old Joseph Pierre Slyvester died from COVID-19 related complications. In a Facebook post, leaders from the Clearwater River Dene Nation, La Loche and the Métis-Nation Saskatchewan offered their condolences to McDonald's family, as she was a well-known elder in the northern community. Sask. orders northern residents to stay in their home communitiesRemembering those lost to COVID-19 in SaskatchewanHealth risk to seniors 'overlooked' in Sask government reopening plan, doctors say La Loche Mayor Robert St. Pierre said it's critical for all northern residents to respect public health orders and recommendations in place. \"If we as a community don't start staying home and practice physical distancing, our numbers are just going to increase,\" he said. \"We've had two deaths in the community with COVID-19 and we want to try and work toward having no more.\ " La Loche mayor Robert St Pierre says his community is proud, hopeful, and desperately in need of support. (Bridget Yard/CBC) St. Pierre said that while people aren't gathering, there have been people out and about. La Loche's long-term care facility was the first in the province to have an outbreak.  Currently, there is one other patient within the facility who has tested positive for the virus, but an update posted on the local COVID-19 Facebook page said they are stable.   As of Thursday afternoon, the province has recorded a total of 389 COVID-19 cases in the province, with more than half of the province's 88 active cases (50) located in the far north. Two-hundred and ninety five cases, roughly 75 per cent of all those reported so far, are listed as recovered. COVID-19 not a get-out-of-jail-free card for Sask. inmatesPoint of View'It's saving my life': An iPad is my dad's lifeline in long-term care during this pandemic The province has deployed additional resources to the community of La Loche and the far north region, which include the introduction of province-supported self-isolation units, drive-through testing, mobile testing and a GenXpert machine, which will increase the speed and volume of testing in the region. St. Pierre said that while the province has put in place adequate resources now, the community would have been better prepared had the help come earlier. \"I don't know how it would have looked like, but I'm sure it would have been a lot better for us right now than what we're currently seeing,\" he said. On Thursday, Premier Scott Moe said his government will continue to work closely with northern leaders. He announced further travel restrictions on the north in an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the region.

  Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The province currently has 270 ventilators, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health.  An additional 16 have been ordered, Health Minister Cameron Friesen said Wednesday. Manitoba's population was roughly 1.38 million in the first quarter of 2020, according to Statistics Canada. That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive. The total does not include ventilators in operating rooms, which are a different type of machine not preferred for critical care or cardiac patients, said Lanette Siraugsa, chief nursing officer for Shared Health, on Saturday. Those machines could be used to treat COVID-19 patients in \"certain situations,\ " she said, but aren't the preferred method. Based on a CBC breakdown of reported ventilators and provincial populations across the country, Manitoba ranks roughly in the middle. Ontario, with a capacity of roughly 12.3 ventilators to 100,000 people, is near the bottom, while Quebec leads the country, with an anticipated capacity of roughly 35.1 ventilators per 100,000 people. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines. They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.   (CBC News) But countries around the world are facing shortages of the machines as the explosion of cases overwhelms health-care systems. In the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, doctors have been forced to decide which patients get priority access, and which do not. That's the scenario Canada is bracing for — and scrambling to prevent — by finding more machines. Prevention also includes flattening the curve through public health measures like social distancing, said Dr. Atul Kapur, an emergency physician in Ottawa and co-chair of the public affairs committee of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. \"Right now, we don't have anywhere close to the capacity or the number of ventilators for the demand that we're anticipating, by looking at what other countries [experience],\" Kapur said. When it comes to ventilators per capita, Ontario's near the bottom \"This is unprecedented. The estimates that we have had so far are just not holding up to the demand that COVID is causing,\" he continued. \"And even now, it's a bit difficult, because we don't know how bad it's going to get.\ " Manitoba preparing 'for the worst case': Top doctor Most Canadian hospitals operate near 100 per cent capacity \"at the best of times,\ " Kapur said. That means they don't have the \"buffer\" to handle a sudden surge in demand — and neither did many other countries. \"That's the problem,\ " Kapur said. \"We're fighting with every other country to increase our numbers.\" Canada's readiness is a \"mixed picture,\ " Kapur said. The country is orders of magnitude away from what it would need for its worst-case scenario. \"Even the best case scenario ... Right now, we don't have the capacity to deal with what that would be,\" Kapur said. \"But hopefully we have time, in a matter of weeks, to build that up.\" Health minister asks Manitoba businesses to provide products, supplies for hospitals during pandemic It's difficult to pinpoint an ideal number of ventilators for Manitoba because the path of the virus in this province could change based on multiple variables, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. \"There's a large variability in the modelling numbers that we have. And so we're looking to prepare not only for the expected case but we're looking to prepare for the worst case,\ " Roussin said at a daily news briefing Thursday. WATCH | Experts say Canada could come up against ventilator shortage in weeks Canada could face a shortage of ventilators within a few weeks if cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. 2:00 \"I don't have a specific number that I could tell you. But we are putting things in place to prepare for worst case scenarios, and so ventilators, critical care beds, those type of things, are part of that plan,\ " Roussin said. The province has called on private businesses to donate ventilators and other supplies. On Friday, Friesen said public health officials have also had talks with manufacturers to see if they could make more of the machines, or other needed equipment. There's also nuance behind the numbers, said Dr. Kelly MacDonald, the head of the section of infectious disease in the department of internal medicine for the University of Manitoba and the WRHA. Respiratory therapists are needed to run the machines. Unions have already raised concerns about staffing levels at Winnipeg hospitals. Respiratory care at HSC overburdened, understaffed even before COVID-19, unions say Health-care experts are also working to find alternatives. Kapur noted some doctors are working on ways to rig ventilators to help two or three patients at a time, instead of just one, for example. \"I think that providing good health care and survival has a lot more to do with a variety of other things, other than just the machines,\ " MacDonald said. Ability to 'change our destiny' in Manitoba: emerging virus expert One of the traits of a COVID-19 outbreak that makes it so hard on health-care systems is a pattern of sickening patients all at once, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. Across the world, health-care systems have seen a sudden influx of very sick patients all at once, rather than staggered, like with influenza, he said.   He hopes that Manitoba has had enough warning to take action and flatten the curve, so that impact won't be as overwhelming here. He praised Manitoba's actions so far on implementing physical distancing measures, and said Manitobans have done a good job of responding to the call so far. \"It's not necessarily just one variable where the virus hits and then you need all the ventilators,\ " Kindrachuk said. \"We still have the ability right now to kind of change our destiny a little bit with what's going to happen in Winnipeg.\ " It's critical for Manitobans to act responsibly now to mitigate some of the pressure that will be placed on the health-care system, MacDonald said. \"Ultimately, how this goes is going to be as much an issue of how we do as a society, as it will be an issue of how people do at hospitals.\ "

The death toll continued to mount, with 681 new victims bringing the world's highest toll to 15,362. In the U.K., the number of fatalities is expected to remain high for at least another week or two even if people comply with stringent isolation measures, health authorities said on Saturday as the country's death toll jumped to 4,313. That number includes five London bus workers — three were drivers and two were controllers. Bus ridership has plummeted by more than 75 per cent but the drivers who died may have been infected before the lockdown.

Greece has quarantined a migrant camp after 20 asylum seekers tested positive, the country's first such facility hit since the outbreak. Police in Greece say they have issued 17,358 fines for people breaking the new restrictions on leaving home since a lockdown began on March 23. France's health director said 7,560 people have now died of coronavirus-related issues since the start of the epidemic in the country, including at least 2,028 in nursing homes. France has experienced 441 more deaths in hospitals in the last 24 hours. A jogger is seen on an empty street along the Seine river during a nationwide lockdown in Paris on Saturday. (Christophe Ena/Associated Press) Bulgaria's Orthodox Christian majority has been urged to stay away from church services during the upcoming Easter holidays, but the church is resisting calls to close — making it the only denomination in the country not to do so. Health officials have voiced fears that many worshippers might ignore the quarantine and attend the church services.  Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said the government would not intervene. Sweden's strategy for fighting COVID-19 differs from most European countries, appearing comparatively more relaxed. Stockholm was quiet but far from deserted on Saturday as Swedes sought to make the most of the sunshine. Swedish authorities have advised the public to practise social distancing, but schools, bars and restaurants are still open, and only gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned. So far, some 373 people have died from COVID-19 in Sweden and there are almost 6,500 cases. WATCH | Sweden's approach to COVID-19 pandemic involves no lockdown : As many countries around the world lock down to deal with COVID-19, Sweden has not taken lockdown measures. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees remain open, as do primary schools and daycares. 4:48 Here's a look at China, South Korea and some other areas of concern around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 8 p.m. ET Throughout much of China, people observed a three-minute moment of reflection on Saturday to honour those who died of COVID-19. Air raid sirens wailed and flags were at half-mast. The pandemic was first detected in Wuhan in December.   Why some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claims   The city was placed under complete lockdown on Jan. 23 in an effort to stem the spread of the virus and has been lauded as a \"heroic city\" by the nation's communist leadership for the sacrifices made by its 11 million citizens. People have gradually been allowed to travel in and out of Wuhan under strict conditions. The quarantine in the city is to be formally lifted on Wednesday.

(Vahid Salemi/Associated Press) In Egypt, the country's main cancer hospital has been quarantined after at least 17 medics tested positive for the virus on Saturday.  The National Cancer Institute will be partly closed for three days to be sterilized, with only the emergency ward remaining open. Egypt has reported 1,070 confirmed cases and 71 fatalities from the global pandemic. Authorities have closed schools and mosques, banned public gatherings and imposed a nighttime curfew to prevent the virus from spreading among the population of 100 million, a fifth of whom live in the densely populated capital, Cairo. Kenya has ordered the quarantine period extended for two weeks in facilities where some people went on \"partying sprees\" and might have spread the new coronavirus. Officials on Saturday reported a high number of cases among those in quarantine facilities and accused some people of not taking social distancing seriously. But some Kenyans have complained to local media about the quarantine conditions that include shared bathrooms and poor hygiene. Kenya has 126 confirmed cases.

(Associated Press) Brazil health officials grappling with the coronavirus outbreak have issued a stark warning about a lack of hospital beds, masks, testing devices and trained staff across Latin America's largest nation. A report published Friday night said Brazil can currently carry out 6,700 tests a day, but that it will need to process as many as 30,000 to 50,000 tests daily during the peak of the outbreak, expected in June. This latest assessment of the public health-care system raises questions about its capacity to face the outbreak in a country of nearly 210 million. It also calls for the maintenance of quarantine measures in states that are most badly hit, challenging President Jair Bolsonaro's more laid-back approach to the virus. As of Saturday afternoon, the health ministry had reported 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 deaths. But the outbreak is still in its early phase, the report said, and the country's hospitals are not ready to handle a peak. Ecuador's government has begun storing the bodies of victims of the coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers as hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil, the centre of the country's outbreak, have already filled morgues and hospitals. Ecuador has confirmed 318 deaths from the virus, one of the highest tallies in Latin America. 
  In the time of the novel coronavirus, Canada and the United States seem to be playing to type: the friendly apologizers of the Great White North coming together against a common enemy, America's combative revolutionaries threatening to tear each other apart. While state governors and federal authorities outbid each other for precious protective gear, Alberta has promised its surplus masks, gloves and ventilators to provinces like B.C. and Quebec, two of Premier Jason Kenney's favourite political targets. Ontario's Doug Ford, leader of a province where fed-bashing is like political oxygen, has been getting moral support from the unlikeliest of sources: Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who insists the feeling is mutual. Then there's those White House briefings, as much like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's doorstep chats as chalk and cheese. \"I've never liked the term 'political culture,' but it does say something to me about the vast cultural difference between the United States and Canada from this perspective,\" said Richard Schultz, an expert on federalism and a 40-year veteran of teaching politics at McGill University before retiring last summer. \"There is this culture (in Canada) of ... more deeply rooted community and social services. We fight about the size of government, we fight about deficits — but when push came to shove, we said, 'Look, there's no one fighting this.' \ " NATO ministers to question reliance on China for pandemic suppliesTrudeau, ministers back Dr. Tam and Health Canada after Jason Kenney attacks pandemic responseBeijing's pandemic response is China's 'Chornobyl moment,' critics say Political scholars have long seen Canada as one of the world's most decentralized federations — a place where Ottawa yields much to the provinces and territories, which manage key services like health and education. Schultz has never shared that view, citing Elections Canada and employment insurance as evidence. COVID-19 has undermined his argument, he acknowledged. \"The traditional image that the Americans are much more centralized and top-down from the federal government, compared to Canada, I think is overstated,\ " Schultz said. \"And yet, I think this is a highly exceptional case that we're dealing with. We have the 10 provinces and the federal government — in a way that I haven't witnessed in the 56 years I've been studying it   — working relatively collaboratively, co-operatively together on this issue.\" 'The federal government has to be realistic about this': Cuomo Stateside, meanwhile, governors on both the east and west coasts, each hit hard by COVID-19, got together Monday to strategize the best way to reopen their shuttered economies, openly if not explicitly defying Trump's insistence that when the time comes, \"sooner rather than later,\ " it will be the U.S. president's decision to make. He made that argument again Monday, in breathtaking fashion. \"The president of the United States, the authority is total. And that's the way it's got to be,\ " Trump said during a brazen, unrestrained news conference so drenched in partisanship that it even included a campaign-ad sizzle reel, assembled by White House staffers, meant to defend his administration's response. \"That being said, we're getting along very well with the governors and I feel very certain that there won't be a problem.\ " New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned that reopening his state, which has seen 10,000 of America's 23,000 COVID-19 deaths to date, will be an intricate, interstate process that demands gradually starting up systems like schools, transit and key businesses in tandem, all the while carefully monitoring the infection rate to ensure it remains under control. \"The federal government has to be realistic about this — you  can't just wish it and then it is so,\ " Cuomo said Tuesday on CNN, warning of a protracted and divisive constitutional fight in the courts if states find their hands forced. \"We don't have King Trump. We have President Trump.\" An orderly response In an election year, Oval Office patience is clearly running short. Trump's new \"Council to Reopen America\ " task force is a panel of loyalists, including daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. U.S. trade czar Robert Lighthizer and Mark Meadows, Trump's new chief of staff, round out the lineup. Presidential wild cards, cultural stereotypes and pandemic-fuelled pandemonium in the U.S. aside, though, why has Canada's response to COVID-19 seemed so orderly by comparison? Katherine Fierlbeck, a political theory professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, traces it to the SARS outbreak of 2003, a deadly viral outbreak that hit Toronto in particular and exposed some of the failings of Canadian federalism when it came to public health. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, right, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford have become unlikely allies in their coordinated fight against the coronavirus. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press) While the provinces and territories do maintain jurisdiction over health care, public health is one of the exceptions, Fierlbeck said. And the Constitution gives Ottawa the power to exercise its judgment and step in \"when things get really bad.\ " But it didn't do that in 2003, when Toronto and Ontario were leading the offensive against SARS and the World Health Organization was looking for a federal response to travel advisories around the world urging tourists to avoid Canada's most populous city. The WHO responded with a crippling advisory of its own that lasted a week and dealt a billion-dollar blow to the city's economy. \"It was because of this international humiliation that Canada really changed the ways that it designed its federal-provincial relationship when it came to public health and especially infectious diseases,\ " a process that spawned the Public Health Agency of Canada, Fierlbeck said. The idea was to integrate federal governance into the public health sphere, both in terms of day-to-day surveillance as well as responding to a crisis, embedding federal officials into provincial agencies to better ensure effective lines of communication and a mutual grasp of how the two levels of government operated. Scheer, Conservatives raise concerns about WHO data, relationship with ChinaCanada is still weeks away from easing pandemic restrictions and restarting economy, Trudeau says \"It was trying to facilitate communication and understanding so that when something happened, there was an understanding, and there's also personal connections with various provinces, and there was an understanding about how resources would be distributed.\ " The agency has also been tested: in 2009, the virulent H1N1 outbreak exposed not federal-provincial breakdowns, but a patchwork of regional health authorities that made it hard for the provinces to co-ordinate efforts. \"Chief public health officers across the whole country have become this generation's rock stars,\" and remain a central pillar of the government's strategy, said Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. The other, she said, is careful collaboration between Ottawa and the provinces. \"That's essential always, but it is particularly important when we face a shared health crisis -- a crisis where provinces deliver front-line health care and where the federal government needs to play an essential role as well. Our approach is going to be to continue to build up and use those two core strengths of Canada's response.\"
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  A Manitoba flour producer is \"running around the clock\" to meet a rise in demand as many people in isolation due to COVID-19 dust off their home-cooking skills and bread-making machines. Clayton Manness, president and co-founder of Prairie Flour Mills Ltd., said he has noticed an uptick in sales. \"I  think it's all to do with a fear factor that people want to have staple products at home in case this gets really drawn out,\ " Manness said. \"And that has continued, but I don't expect that to last overly long.\" Against \"all good\" advice, Manness said he built his independent business 20 years ago in Elie, Man., west of Winnipeg, without the backing of major grain companies.  The mill, which primarily produces wheat flour and organic wheat flour, recently saw sales spike by about 30 per cent. Sales began to surge mid-month, around the time the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of Sunday, there were more than 630,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Manitoba saw its first death this week due to the novel coronavirus and the highest same-day jump in cases, up to 72 confirmed and probable cases as of Sunday.   As restaurants temporarily shutter and the province further restricts public gatherings to a maximum of 10 people, grocers in Winnipeg appear to be struggling to keep staple products such as flour and sugar on their shelves. Anxious customers have been hoarding food and supplies such as toilet paper against the advice of public health officials and Manitoba Health Minister Cameron Friesen, who said earlier in March it is not necessary to stockpile food. Empty tables, uncertain futures: Winnipeg restaurants close during COVID-19 outbreakGatherings will be limited to 10 people in Manitoba as of Monday due to COVID-19 At the mill, Manness said he has not laid off any of his 35 employees as a result of the outbreak and is running longer shifts to keep up with the high demand. The mill is shipping as much bulk flour as it can produce to supply retailers, including clients in the United States and one of the largest bakeries in Winnipeg. Manness said he has never seen an interest in baking like this. The per capita consumption of flour at home has been slowly dropping over the decades — until this newfound desire to stock cupboards in residences \"where people can bake their own bread and their own products,\ " he said. Personal hygiene and physical distancing measures are taken very seriously at the mill because \"if we were to get the virus within the plant, then we no longer can produce food for people that want it,\" he said.   Manness said bags of wheat will keep pouring in for the next several weeks, which is about how long he imagines the \"explosion of new demand\" will last. Then they will drop back to a normal cycle — grinding and refining up to 40,000 tonnes of product a year to be bagged up and delivered to retailers. Manness said he would be \"overjoyed\ " if people kept up the old tradition of baking, which would benefit his business. \"As long as people have access to yeast and sugar, of course, then they can bake bread,\ " he said. 
  The Northwest Territories is investing in new COVID-19 testing technology that could deliver rapid results — but the technology will likely take more than a month to arrive. According to Dr. Sarah Cook, the N.W.T.'s territorial medical director, health authorities have ordered two new types of testing technology that can deliver COVID-19 test results in under an hour. One, called GeneXpert, can analyze the molecules in a nasal swab in under 45 minutes, according to a release from Cepheid, the company that produces the system. The FDA granted it \"emergency approval\" as a COVID-19 test last month. Because of its complexity, Cook said, it can only be deployed in the labs of Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife. The other, called the Spartan Cube, bills itself as \"the world's smallest DNA analyzer,\" and is designed to be used \"in non-laboratory settings such as airports, cruise ships, military bases, and other critical points of entry,\" according to its website. Cook said it's likely to be distributed to hospitals and health centres in Fort Smith, Inuvik and Hay River, as well as Yellowknife. A technician uses the GeneXpert testing machine at Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit. Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife has ordered a GeneXpert system to test for COVID-19, according to the territorial medical director. (CBC) Spartan Bioscience, the Ottawa-based company that produces the Spartan Cube, says it's still \"exploring how to perform the [COVID-19] test on its platform,\ " but it has signed agreements to produce the tests for Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. Founder Paul Lem told the Ottawa Business Journal in late March he expected a COVID-19 test to be ready \"within weeks.\ " Cook said the new equipment should arrive in the next four to six weeks, and when it does, it's expected to make a big difference to the territory's testing time. Current tests sent to Alberta Currently, tests from the N.W.T. are sent to labs in Alberta, leading to delays of three days or more. \"There's a delay from transport, and there's a delay because of the backup in the lab in Alberta,\ " Cook explained. With this new equipment, she said, health authorities will get a much better understanding of the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. A man holds the Spartan Cube, which the company describes as 'the world's smallest DNA analyzer.' (Spartan Bioscience/Facebook) \"It's going to help us … understand where we are on the curve, in real time, rather than a lag of three to four days,\ " she said. Rapid testing becomes essential in the event of community spread — the transmission of COVID-19 between individuals in the N.W.T.

But, she cautioned that \"community spread could happen anytime. It could happen tomorrow, it could happen in a few weeks. \"It's impossible to say.\ "
  The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) says it is not accepting donations of homemade masks, gowns or other personal protective equipment.   SHA said it will accept things like unopened and sealed boxes of non-latex gloves, disposable gowns and masks, but are asking that people not deliver them directly to their facilities. SHA will be accepting donations from suppliers, industry associations, companies and organization drives. If you have supplies to donate you can email procurement@gov.sk.ca. They also do not want anyone dropping off food or beverage donations for health-care workers to share. SHA said it appreciates the support, but they follow guidelines set out by the chief medical health officer. Supplies running low Jennifer Prive started to turn to homemade equipment as personal protective equipment supplies start to run low. Prive, who works out of Regina as a continuing care assistant, said masks are harder to come by every day. \"[Cloth masks], at the end of the day, we can wash them and sterilize them to be able to use them over again when we go to our clients the next day,\" she said. Prive said she wants to ensure that frontline workers can be kept as safe as possible throughout the crisis. Do cloth masks work? The effectiveness of cloth masks hasn't been studied much and would depend on the type of fabric, said Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff for Humber River Hospital in Toronto. \"They do tend to be quite porous,\ " he added. Which masks should healthcare professionals be wearing? It varies, according to Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask. Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols, like inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages).

  Saskatchewan reported 14 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, bringing its total to 220. Forty-eight people have recovered from the virus in the province, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. An assisted-living care centre worker in Regina has tested positive for the virus. A long list of professionals has petitioned the province to release inmates in light of the pandemic.   Saskatchewan's privacy commissioner says \"more information is better'\" during a health crisis like COVID-19.    The Saskatchewan Health Authority has offered an early glimpse at some of the factors health care teams might weigh to decide which COVID-19 patients get ventilators if there are not enough to go around. Dr. Susan Shaw, the SHA's chief medical officer, said the details are still being finalized and, at the moment, remain hypothetical. \"We're not there right now,\ " Shaw said in an interview Thursday.   While it's not clear, cumulatively, how many of Saskatchewan's COVID-19 cases have needed a ventilator, the maximum number of coronavirus cases who have been under intensive care (ICU) at the same time is known to be two.   As of Thursday, four COVID-19 patients were in hospital in the province, including two people in ICU.   Shaw's colleague Dr. Saqib Shahab — Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer and the public face of the province's fight to \"flatten the curve\ " — said it's hard to know when the province might reach its infection peak.    \"Obviously at some point we want to see the curve going down. Is that going to be in four weeks, eight weeks? We really can't predict,\ " he said on Wednesday.     COVID-19 in Sask. : No telling yet when province will reach infection peak, premier says   The province currently has 450 ventilators and has ordered hundreds more. One early-draft planning doc, leaked last week, estimated that at peak infection time, Saskatoon alone might need 500 to 600 ventilators at a time.   Health officials in Saskatchewan and elsewhere have undertaken the grim but necessary exercise of contemplating who would get a ventilator should hospitals be swarmed with serious cases while not having enough machines to go around. \"One of the main purposes of actually having this work done in preparation is a part of our responsibility to avoid arbitrary decisions,\" Shaw said. \"Right now the decisions are made about what's best for the individual. And when you get into a situation where you're starting to actually face scarcity, the ethical principles shift to be what's best for society.\ " Dr. Susan Shaw is the chief medical officer for the Saskatchewan Health Authority. (CBC News) Age is not the only factor Decisions about which patients would get ventilators would be made by doctors and members of the health authority's ethics commities, Shaw said. The age of patients is a key consideration, but not the only one, she said.   \"It's actually one of a combination of criteria,\ " she said. \"To make decisions solely on age would be discriminatory and would not be the way we would want to approach this. It's age in combination with frailty, chronic disease and recoverability.\ " In the \"extremely unlikely\" scenario where two patients' criteria lined up exactly, the ventilator would go to the younger patient, Shaw said.   \"That's based on the principle called the goal of the life cycle, which is every individual needs to have the equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life.\"   At the Top of the Covid-19 Curve , How Do Hospitals Decide Who Gets Treatment?    What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?    No one would completely stop being cared for, however. \"That always applies no matter what the situation is,\ " Shaw said. \"This means making sure that we never abandon the patient.\" Medical health professionals elsewhere have also contemplated the notion of a lottery.   While Shaw stressed that that option is not in Saskatchewan's current way of thinking, she is familiar with the concept. \"My understanding is that if you ever got into a tiebreaker situation where absolutely everything [including age] was identical — and again I think this is absolutely hypothetical — then a lottery is one of the ways that you could tackle that.\" New numbers,  Regina worker tests positive Friday's daily update from health officials included 14 new cases, bringing the total provincial tally to 220. Shahab said the comparatively low daily case additions in Saskatchewan — which have averaged 14 per day, after the province saw its largest day-over-day increase of 30 on March 27 — \"are to some extent reassuring.\" \"However, we are seeing that less and less of those are due to travel,\" he said. Of the total 220 cases, 102 are recent travellers, 52 tested positive because of exposure to someone they live with or after they attended an event, 10 have no known exposures and 56 are still investigation. The province added yet more detail to its daily report, for the first time specifying what region each fatal victim of the virus came from.   Sask. should 'lower privacy bar to serve greater good,' says health analyst   Shahab was asked about specifying which community an infected person came from (beyond Saskatoon and Regina). \"As our numbers increase that becomes easier to do,\" he said.   Here's how the cases break down regionally.   (Duk Han Lee) The province said a worker at Eden Care, an assisted living facility in Regina, has tested positive for the virus. The person was identified by another positive test case, through the process known as contact tracing.   \"There are no indications it has spread to other employees or residents,\" the health ministry said in a release. \"The facility is closed to admissions, discharges and transfers, and residents who have been in close contact with the employee will be isolated and monitored twice-daily for 14 days.\" Effective Friday , all people working in long-term care facilities in Saskatchewan will have their temperatures checked and will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms before beginning their shifts. On a promising note, 48 out of 220 people have recovered from the virus, making for a recovery rate of 22 per cent of known cases. Pandemic planning updates coming next week Premier Scott Moe said Thursday that he had asked the health authority to publicly release updated projections of how many people in the province might become infected and die from the virus, under various scenarios.     COVID-19 in Sask: Internal draft gov't document outlines 'worst case scenario' of up to 15,000 deaths    That update — which will also touch on planning for field hospitals and COVID-19 care in existing hospitals — is expected early next week. \"They all do fit together,\ " Shaw said of the modelling, the operational plan and the ethical framework for decision-making.   \"We want to share it,\ " she said of the ethical framework. \"It's not quite ready to be shared but it is ready to start being talked about.\" 'None of this can be rushed'   A front-line aspect of Saskatchewan's pandemic planning has come to light thanks to a Facebook post on Thursday. A health care worker shared photos of herself and colleagues at Royal University Hospital clothed in face shields, gloves and full-body suits. They were practicing intubation on \"Harold.\ "   \"Harold is a simulation dummy for the newly formed intubation teams to practice on,\ " the worker wrote. \"We are teams of anaesthesiologists, AAs and nurses who practice and train day or night every shift until there is a real patient with COVID-19 who cannot breathe on their own. \"I am grateful that we have this time to get prepared,\" the worker added.   Health providers at Royal University Hospital have practiced intubating on a COVID-19 patient using this dummy, named 'Harold.' (Facebook) Shaw confirmed this type of COVID-19-specific training has gone on for at least two weeks. \"Putting a breathing tube in somebody is a very routine activity for an anesthesiologist and many other health care professionals,\ " Shaw said. \"But how do you do it [properly] while appropriately donning and doffing equipment?\ "   Shaw even joined in the exercise later on Thursday.   Spent my evening at RUH ICU with <a href=\"https://twitter.com /SaskHealth?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@SaskHealth</a > anesthesia airway team practicing scenarios to safely care for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19SK?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19SK</a> patients<br><br > Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands&mdash;@drsusanshaw \"Proud of my colleagues. We are in good hands,\ " Shaw wrote on Twitter. ' Staff safety is the number one priority' The health care worker who posted on Facebook said putting on and taking off equipment takes a long time, but with good reason. \"So that we health care people can be as safe as we can,\ " she wrote. \"None of this can be rushed as staff safety is the number one priority.\ " During Thursday's provincial COVID-19 news conference, Moe said the procurement of more personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers was his top priority on a call that same afternoon with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other premiers. The health worker wrote in their Facebook post that the trainees weren't wearing N95 masks in order to \"save them for when they are actually needed.\ " At the same provincial news conference, Shahab cited instances where it was not initially known a patient had respiratory symptoms and so health care workers were not wearing the right PPE. Shahab said patients should always phone a clinic instead of just going there.     COVID-19 in Sask : 6 more health care workers infected with virus, top doc says   The health care worker training for COVID-19 intubation had some advice too. \"You definitely don't want to become a Harold. Stay home, and stay safe.\ "
  Health Minister Adrian Dix says B.C. will step up enforcement to make sure parking is available for health-care workers and patients now that it's been made free at hospitals across the province. He said there are particular concerns about people taking advantage of parking lots at New Westminster's Royal Columbian Hospital, which is next to a SkyTrain station, and St. Paul's Hospital, which is in the heart of downtown Vancouver. \"It's unacceptable if people are misusing parking that's been made available,\" Dix said Friday. \"There is going to be enforcement taken for people who misuse parking, because we need that parking to be available for the staff at the hospital and for patients at the hospital.\ " As of April 1, parking at all hospitals and health authority-operated sites is free. Dix said the move was meant to reduce the risk of novel coronavirus infection from shared parking machines, and to encourage physical distancing. On Friday, Dix acknowledged that parking fees at hospitals have been an ongoing issue during his term as health minister — long before the COVID-19 outbreak hit the province. \"I think it's fair to say I've learned more about parking than many other things in my life,\ " he joked. 
  We're breaking down what you need to know about the pandemic by answering your questions. Send yours to covid@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We're publishing a selection of answers every weekday online, and putting some of your questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network.    We've received thousands of emails from all corners of the country. Your questions cover a range of topics including a number about CPAP machines and going back to school.   When can children go back to school? CBC Kids tells us the No. 1 question about COVID-19 they're hearing is when will children get to go back to school. Adults are also wondering when this will all be over, including Anastasia from Bainsville, Ont. Every province is dealing with their COVID-19 outbreaks differently, which means schools in some provinces could open up earlier than others. There is no definitive date.   Dr. Brian Goldman — host of CBC Radio's White Coat Black Art and new podcast The Dose — says once public health officials confirm we're past the peak of COVID-19, and the number of cases starts going down, we'll be on the right track. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory But that's \"unlikely to happen in the next two to three weeks,\ " Goldman says.  \"I think all of us need to prepare for the strong possibility that school won't start again until June or the summer, or the fall.\ "    You can listen to more questions from kids on this episode of the CBC's The Current. Would a CPAP machine help as a ventilator? We received a lot of questions, including one from Bienvenido I., about whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines could be used to help COVID-19 patients. The limited supply of ventilators is one of the key concerns facing hospitals as they prepare for more COVID-19 cases. CPAP machines are used to provide minor breathing support to sleep apnea patients. However, one doctor says they're not a substitute for ventilators. \"If someone was pretty sick with [COVID-19,] I don't think that would particularly help them,\" said Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious diseases specialist and chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital. He also warned that CPAP machines might help spread the virus. \"They're one of the devices we worry about that may be responsible for some of the spread,\" particularly in hospitals and in long-term care homes, he said. What is the treatment for mild cases of COVID-19?   Michael F. asked about what to do if you have a mild case of COVID-19. Right now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. If your symptoms are mild, the best thing to do is to stay home, says Gardam.   Health Canada's advice is the same: if you have symptoms, isolate yourself for 14 days to avoid spreading the virus. But if you're having trouble breathing or experiencing a high fever that doesn't break, Gardam suggests going to the hospital for treatment, which could include oxygen and acetaminophen. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Gardam joins Heather Hiscox to answer COVID-19 questions. 4:56 If a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, can they get sick again with the virus later? This question is on the minds of many Canadians, including Jeff L.   Since this is a new coronavirus, little is known about it and experts don't have an answer to that question yet.   However, infectious disease expert Dr. Allison McGeer in Toronto says there's \"good reason to hope\" that if you've had COVID-19 once, you'll be protected for at least a few months or a couple of years. But she can't be sure. Read more about what we know about the virus in here. I have an elderly relative who lives on her own and needs my assistance. How do I safely visit to help with her needs? Many Canadians, including Alyssa and Jackie, want to know how to care for older friends and family. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch admits it's a challenging situation, because everyone needs to practise physical distancing, and the elderly are a vulnerable population. But some seniors who live alone need help. Bogoch says the best thing to do if you have to make a house call is practise impeccable hand hygiene, and to make sure anyone who has symptoms does not go inside.    Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus in Canada, including whether cloth masks are a good idea for essential workers. 3:54 On Monday we answered questions about delivered groceries and pregnancies.

  For many Prince Edward Islanders, the only shopping they are doing since the coronavirus pandemic was declared about six weeks ago is at grocery stores — because well, people have to eat. Because of that, people working in grocery stores, along with a handful of others including truck drivers and health-care staff, are considered essential front-line workers. They haven't been forced to work, but they've definitely been asked to step up.   \"We're doing as much as we can to feel comfortable,\" said Linda Carter, the head cashier at MacPhee's Market in Souris, P.E.I., an independent Loblaws grocery retailer where she has worked for almost five years.   Jodi Whitehead is a front-end manager at Sobeys, helping to oversee the more than 60 cashiers and parcel pickup at the grocery chain's Stratford, P.E.I., location. She's worked with the company for more than 25 years.    It's not as nerve-racking as it was three weeks ago.— Linda Carter \"It is a difficult time, it's not something we're used to,\ " Whitehead said via phone from the store Tuesday. But she said when she goes to work during the pandemic, what she's been feeling mostly is pride. \"Very proud to come to work, work with my teammates, my staff — and it gives us the opportunity to show our community what we're capable of doing,\ " she said, adding she also doesn't want to let down the store's regular customers.   ' We have to stay healthy' Both women say the measures their stores are taking make them feel relatively safe from contracting the virus. The low number of cases on P.E.I. — there have been 26, with 24 considered recovered — also gives them a sense the measures are working, they said.   ' We definitely feel safe here,' says front-end manager Jodi Whitehead of the Stratford Sobeys where she works. (Submitted by Sobeys) Changes at most grocery stores for cashiers include frequent handwashing, sanitizing cash registers and debit machines, standing back from customers as much as possible and bagging groceries in paper bags instead of reusable ones. Many have also installed Plexiglas barriers to separate cashiers from customers. Staff are sanitizing grocery carts between uses. Many stores, including MacPhee's and Sobeys have added security officers at the door who limit the number of customers in the store. Sobeys is also now offering staff clear plastic face shields to wear if they wish. The changes carry over to home life, too — Carter said she's doing a lot of sanitizing doorknobs and other surfaces at home. She said she hasn't self-isolated from her husband, but changes her clothes as soon as she returns home, and cleans the house a lot.   She said she's also glued to the news constantly as soon as she gets home, for the latest on the pandemic. \"It's kind of hard on the head,\ " she said of her new routines.   Whitehead takes her uniform home and washes it after every shift, and does lots of handwashing. She and her retired husband stay home to keep themselves safe too, she said.   Many customers have been thanking them for their service, which they say is much appreciated. ' The majority of people are understanding this and obeying what they're told to do,' says Linda Carter of measures like physical distancing at checkouts.    (Submitted by Sobeys Inc.) \"We have to kind of tell the customers from time to time to stand behind the line where it says for social distancing, and you kind of like to keep them behind the Plexiglas — we have to stay healthy for us to be able to feed them,\ " Carter said.   \"Most of them have been fairly good,\ " she added. \"The majority of people are understanding this and obeying what they're told to do.\ "  A few, however, do get impatient with some of the measures like standing behind lines for physical distancing and allowing clerks to pack their groceries in paper bags rather than reusable bags they've brought, to make transactions quicker.   \"Some customers, you know, not having a good day — probably scared. I get that, and the cashiers get that. But some of the cashiers are also a little bit scared,\ " Whitehead said. \"So it's a little bit of understanding on both sides.\" Sometimes just explaining why staff are doing things differently helps ease situations, she said.   Point of ViewI'm a grocery store cashier, and I'm not doing so great right nowOne trip per week. One person per household. That should be the law for grocery buying, union says Worth it? A month ago, a grocery store owner in Toronto's Little India was the first person in the city to die from COVID-19. A few days later a Superstore employee in Oshawa, Ont., also died from the illness. Grocery stores like Sobeys have begun sanitizing shopping carts to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19. (Maria José Burgos/CBC) Is the job worth risking their lives? \"Actually , I don't even — I try not to think about things like that,\ " Carter said. \"I just hope that I'm doing the best that I can for myself to protect my family, my customers, my workers. So we're all trying to do our best ... to do everything we're told to keep each other safe , that's about all you can do.\ "  Loblaws, which owns Superstores, Shoppers Drug Marts and No Frills stores, upped wages by 15 per cent during the pandemic. Sobeys launched what it calls its hero pay program for front-line staff, which gives them an extra $50 a week as well as $2 more per hour for those who work more than 20 hours.    \"I think it's a nice gesture for them to offer to give us more for sure because face it, you are out there in the front line,\ " Carter said. \"The store here is great for putting in all kinds of measures and asking us how we're doing, if we feel OK and how we're handling it.\ " Whitehead agrees \"there wasn't any expectations to have anything,\ " so the raise was a big morale-booster for staff.   Shopping safely: The challenges of managing a grocery store amid COVID-19How to safely shop for groceries in a global pandemic 'Never thought of leaving' Some staff have stopped working temporarily to look after children who are out of school, because they are immune compromised or because they are afraid. At Sobeys, Whitehead said they've hired several new employees to replace those, as well as to prepare for what is usually a busy season in summer. Scheduling has been an immense challenge, Whitehead said. Whitehead says most customers have been thanking them for their work, which is much appreciated. (Submitted by Sobeys) Carter said she's been working since she was 12 or 13 in her parents' restaurant and enjoys working with the public.   \"I never thought of leaving or anything like that,\ " Carter said. \"Never crossed my mind, actually.\"  While Carter is looking forward to the pandemic being over, she said she agrees with the province's slow and steady approach to easing back to normal.   \"I'm still really quite — I'm nervous , I don't think anything should be opened too soon,\ " Carter said. \"I still think we need to carry on with this for just a little bit longer. We'll see how the numbers go. Nova Scotia has quite a bit [of coronavirus cases] so you'll have people coming over if you open up too much, and that's a little unnerving. \"It's not as nerve-racking as it was three weeks ago,\ " she added.

  The 2020 edition of Ottawa Bluesfest is cancelled because of COVID-19. Executive director Mark Monahan made the announcement Tuesday morning, saying organizers reached the decision after speaking to health authorities, government officials and ticket holders. Ticket holders can get refunds starting Friday, but Monahan encouraged them to hold onto their passes for next year's event. \"We encourage you to think about keeping your ticket for next year, which will help support our local non-profit organization to continue to retain our staff, employ local artists, and deliver an exceptional festival in 2021,\" he wrote. Some acts booked for this year's festival including blink-182, Boyz II Men, Jack Johnson and Lil Tecca, have already been rebooked for next year, he said. Alanis Morissette, seen here performing at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in April 2019, is just one of the headliners who won't be appearing at Ottawa Bluesfest this summer. (Amy Harris/Associated Press) Bluesfest was going to bring Alanis Morissette, Rage Against the Machine, Marshmello and more to LeBreton Flats July 9 to 19. This follows the cancellation of other popular events including the Ottawa Jazz Festival and Canada Day celebrations because of COVID-19 gathering restrictions. Ottawa won't be issuing any event permits until July at the earliest, while Quebec has said it's unlikely to host any festivals this summer.

  As emergency and intensive care doctors around the globe work frantically to save the lives of people gravely ill with COVID-19, one of the world's foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators. \"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen in Germany, gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation. The technique was first met with ridicule before being widely adopted. At the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, many emergency departments were immediately placing COVID-19 patients with alarmingly low levels of oxygen on mechanical ventilators, a standard practice for a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But in a paper published this week in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, Gattinoni and colleagues wrote that COVID-19 appears to diverge in key ways from normal ARDS, and that the usual recommended use of ventilators at high pressure that works for standard respiratory distress cases may actually harm some COVID-19 patients. Luciano Gattinoni, a professor in the department of anesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Göttingen, Germany, says ventilators are being misused and overused during the COVID-19 pandemic. (CBC) COVID-19 patients, like those suffering from ARDS, have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood, which leads to breathing problems. In ARDS cases, the lungs lose their elasticity. But in many cases of COVID-19, the lungs remain elastic and people are able to continue breathing for some time despite the low oxygen levels. This \"remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS,\" he writes, adding that patients with normal looking lungs but low oxygen are at risk of lung injury from the ventilators, where pressure from the air damages the thin air sacs that exchange oxygen with the blood. In Gattinoni's study, only 20 to 30 per cent of patients fully fit the severe ARDS criteria. Different types of patients requiring differentiated types of treatment are best identified by CT scan, says Gattinoni. But if CT scans are not available, doctors can indirectly gauge a patient's needs based on \"surrogate\" measurements of lung stiffness, for instance, and other factors. With the standard ARDS treatment, Gattinoni says, people are put on a ventilator sometimes too late, or too early, with the ventilator's pressure set too high, causing damage. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayINTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   Marco Garrone, an emergency doctor at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, Italy, calls Gattinoni's paper \"a game changer.\ " He said it states clearly what he and his colleagues have been experiencing in the emergency room since the pandemic exploded in northern Italy in late February. \"We started with a one-size-fits-all attitude, which didn't pay off,\" Garrone said of the practice of putting patients on ventilators right away, only to see their conditions deteriorate. \"Now we try to delay intubation as much as possible.\" Factors such as the overall health of the person before catching COVID-19, or how sick they are by the time they arrive in hospital, could also affect how well a person fares. Oxygen without force Garrone says his emergency department now begins with non-invasive ventilation — different ways of getting oxygen into patients' lungs without force, such as a mask or a nasal cannula. This helps people in the early stages of the disease to inhale enough oxygen without damaging their lungs. A staffer works on a ventilator refurbishing assembly line in Sunnyvale, Calif., late last month. Hard-hit New York has reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. (Beth Laberge/KQED via AP) Doctors in New York state and elsewhere have voiced similar concerns about putting patients on ventilators too soon and with the pressure too high. Many have begun to delay their use, after New York authorities reported a death rate of 80 per cent for people who go on ventilators. However, the head of critical care at Toronto's University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital, cautions against drawing any firm conclusions from Gattinoni's paper. Niall Ferguson, who is also site-lead at Toronto General Hospital, also says with no data to back it up, the 80 per cent rate in New York is anecdotal and seems \"extreme.\" 'It's mostly a theory' Ferguson, who calls Luciano Gattinoni \"the E.F. Hutton of intensive care — when Gattinoni talks, people listen,\" recalling a once-famous brokerage firm ad, was one of the editors of Gattinoni's paper at Intensive Care Medicine. His observations about COVID-19 \"have generated a lot of discussion in the medical community and on Twitter,\" Ferguson said. \"But I think it's important to recognize that it's mostly a theory at this point.\ " With many IC units operating near capacity, he says, doctors do not have the time to randomize patients to one treatment protocol or another in order to study the effectiveness of each. The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) published one study earlier this month on the death rate of COVID-19 patients on ventilators in the hardest-hit Italian region of Lombardy. It actually showed a relatively low death rate on ventilators, 26 per cent, but Ferguson and Garrone both dismissed its results because many patients were still on ventilators when the data was collected and may have died after. Garrone said it's when ICU units get overwhelmed that the risk of misuse of ventilators is highest. ' It's been a constant flood' \"Everyone talks about COVID as being a tsunami, but a tsunami is a wave that passes. Here in Italy, it's been a constant flood,\" he said. \"ICU physicians in Italy are well-versed with ventilation. But these patients were so overwhelming in numbers that they trickled out of the ICU into the emergency department. And that's where we began to ventilate them.\ " 3.I have had to become braver about not intubating patients. I think we should avoid intubation if at all possible. I have previously been an advocate of intubating early to ensure safe, non-emergent intubating conditions. My perspective is shifting.&mdash;@jessica_bunin Ferguson agrees that the use of ventilators becomes an issue with doctors, pulled into a crisis situation, who are less experienced with the devices. But he said the IC community of doctors he's in touch with are well aware that treatment of COVID-19 patients needs to be individualized, which was Gattinoni's main point. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada?CBC IN ITALYThe lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world Laura Duggan, an anesthesiologist at the Ottawa Hospital, told the Emcrit podcast for emergency and critical care doctors that, like many ICU doctors, she looked to intubate patients with low oxygen right away, but that she's \"happy to see that pendulum swinging back a bit\" to figuring out what else can be done. \"I think there is a balance to be had between finding something that's simple and widely applicable versus trying to still personalize things for each patient,\" said Ferguson. 
  New Brunswickers could have their COVID-19 test results within 45 minutes instead of waiting up to two days, starting as early as next week  — provided the province doesn't run out of testing supplies. The Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation's COVID-19 emergency fund is paying for lab upgrades at seven hospitals across the province, which will enable them to analyze tests taken within their communities, said Dr. John Dornan, the Horizon Health Network's chief of staff. Until now, all New Brunswick test swabs have been driven in batches to the lab at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton. Adding GeneXpert instruments to Horizon and Vitalité hospitals in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John will have \"tremendous ramifications,\" said Dornan. Instead of people having to wait between 24 and 48 hours in a COVID-19 unit at a hospital or while self-isolating at home, they will know their results in less than one hour. Poor supply of COVID-19 test kits restrained testing, but province still running outN.B. COVID-19 roundup: Province could run out of test supplies within 1 week \"This is great news for patients, but also a critical improvement when testing our health-care staff,\ " he said.   \"We will now know in 45 minutes whether we need to send staff home or if they can carry on providing the excellent care they do everyday.\" New Brunswick has 91 cases of COVID-19, as of Thursday afternoon, when 10 new cases were announced. Three people remain in hospital, including the first case in intensive care. The province's testing capacity will be \"huge\" once the labs are up and running, likely within a couple of weeks, said Dornan. And the timing \"couldn't be better,\ " he said. It will coincide with a planned ramp-up in testing. \"The whole successes in other parts of the world were done with significant increases in testing when required. We're going to need that in the not too distant future.\" Premier Blaine Higgs said he plans to release COVID-19 projections for New Brunswick in a week. (CBC) On Thursday night, Premier Blaine Higgs told CBC's Power and Politics that New Brunswick could run out of COVID-19 testing supplies within a week with ramped up testing and personal protective equipment within three or four weeks. \"But we have orders that are pending and hoping to arrive,\ " he said. The Moncton lab is conducting about 500 tests a day but has the capacity to perform up to 1,000 tests a day, Higgs said. \"Granted, if we went to 1,000 tests a day we would be looking at supplies needed within about five days,\" the premier said. Testing may target those without symptoms Dornan could not immediately say whether the newly upgraded labs will analyze swabs like the Moncton lab, sputum samples  \"or some other means.\ " But he did say he expects the labs will start testing people in the community who \"might not have very typical symptoms.\ " \"Thus far, we believe that the vast majority of people that have the disease when they're tested have some degree of symptoms,\ " he said. \"But we are worried that when it is more rampant in the community then, you know, is it possible that people will start shedding virus and be asymptomatic?\" Other targeted groups for testing will include people living in homes for seniors and assisted-living facilities, who are considered \"at risk.\ " Dr. John Dornan says seven sites will get an upgrade to determine COVID-19 results much faster, thanks to funding from the Saint John Hospital Foundation. The Foundation is also buying two higher level life support machines known as ECMO. 8:39 New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell called the lab upgrades \"a very positive development.\" \"We're looking at rolling that out late next week, perhaps Thursday,\" she said. The capacity of the labs will vary, Russell said, with the smaller centres expected to handle about 16 test results a day and the larger ones, about 84 daily. The software upgrades and components for existing equipment at the seven labs will cost $525,000, according to the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation. Buying 2 lung machines The foundation is also purchasing two machines to help with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, lung capacity and function can be severely affected. The two portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support systems machines oxygenate the blood, allowing the lungs to rest. The premier thanked the foundation for the donation of the life-saving equipment. It is \"just one example of how the people in this province are coming together to support one another,\ " Higgs said. The total cost of the two ECMO machines is $137,500, the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation said. The foundation's emergency fund, established to be used for areas of greatest need in the province during the pandemic, has seen donations of more than $1.1 million over two weeks. Of that, $1 million was donated by the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation. 
  The learned experiences from a devastating flu pandemic 100 years ago that staggered the world don't make it any easier this time around, says a historian and author who specializes in health and infectious disease. While there are many similarities between how society is responding to COVID-19 and how it reacted to the Spanish flu of 1918-19, \"there isn't a playbook,\" said Esyllt Jones, a professor of history at the University of Manitoba. The Spanish flu first raged through the battlefields of the First World War before moving into other countries. (Library of Congress) A century ago, health professionals faced an organism they didn't know a lot about. The same holds true now. COVID-19 and the Spanish flu both presented novel, or new, viruses — which means there are no treatments, no vaccines, and no one has been exposed before so there is no immunity, said Jones, author of the book Influenza 1918: Disease, Death, and Struggle in Winnipeg. \"Each outbreak is its own thing, in its own context, and there's a lot about COVID-19 that's completely unique.  So people are really having to figure it out as they go.\" Three men, believed to be in Alberta, are shown wearing masks during the Spanish influenza pandemic.   (Winnipeg Tribune Archives/University of Manitoba) There is some greater scientific understanding now than in 1918, when viruses had not even been isolated yet, Jones said. \"But there is this underlying sense of not really knowing how the disease is behaving exactly.\ " Pallister says province will hit pocketbooks of 'selfish' Manitobans who don't follow public-health rulesHow should Manitoba penalize people who don't practise safe distancing? Here's what other provinces are doing That results in confusion for people about which messages they need to listen to. There have been, for example, mixed messages about the benefits of masks and whether someone without symptoms should wear one. Still others have resorted to thinking it's just a bad cold and officials are overreacting, or that the pandemic is worse somewhere else and not a big concern locally. Guidance on how to prevent Influenza, published in the Illustrated Current News, on Oct. 18, 1918.   (National Library of Medicine) That was the same thought in 1918. In the late spring, as allied troops in Europe were battling the German army, word began to reach Canada that another invader was killing soldiers.  A deadly flu was raging through the battlefields, causing fever and fatigue, pounding headaches and sore throats, before filling the lungs with fluid and choking the breath from its victims. The flu started earlier in the year but the warring countries, not wanting to give information to the enemy, suppressed the news. Spain was a neutral country in the First World War, so the first uncensored news about the flu came from there, leading to the name. The Manitoba Free Press announced the arrival of the Spanish flu on Oct. 1, 1918. (Manitoba Free Press) Manitobans were initially shocked but not fearful — after all , Europe was an ocean away.  If the flu did reach Canada's shores, Manitoba was thousands of kilometres from any major port. There was a sense of immunity. That came to a sudden end in the fall. The flu arrived in Canada on the same ships that brought troops home. It then made its way across the country by rail, reaching Winnipeg in late September. Returning soldiers at Union Station in Winnipeg. Troops coming home brought the deadly flu virus with them from the battlefields of Europe.   (Archives of Manitoba) As the death toll mounted, Winnipeggers faced long bouts of isolation in an effort to rein in the spread. Churches and schools, along with entertainment venues such as movie theatres, billiard halls, dance halls, and public bathhouses, were shuttered. Gatherings were banned and limits put on how many people could be on streetcars or in grocery stores. Hospital visiting hours were abolished and personal care homes were closed to all visitors. The Winnipeg Evening Tribune of Nov. 4, 1918, lists the methods the city took to try to contain the flu. (Winnipeg Tribune Archives/University of Manitoba) People were urged to wash and a no-spitting bylaw was enforced for the first time in years. Quarantine wards were set up in hospitals, and makeshift hospitals were created in available buildings as the regular facilities filled up. A familiar story Flash forward to 2019 and the story is much the same. News surfaced in December about a flu outbreak in Wuhan, China.  As  cases mounted, it swept into Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Still, many people in Canada continued, unfazed, with regular plans — including travel. There was a sense of being cautious but not overly worried, even as the first death from the illness in Canada was reported March 9 in British Columbia. Two days later, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, pointing to 118,000 cases in 110 countries and territories, and thousands of deaths. Spitting in Winnipeg, and in many cities around the world, was strictly banned and the laws were enforced during the Spanish flu pandemic. (Historical Medical Library of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia)Nurses hold a casket outside Winnipeg's Gardiner Funeral Home during the flu epidemic of 1918-1919. (L.B. Foote Collection/Archives of Manitoba) From that point, the dominoes fell. Professional sports leagues cancelled their seasons and major events began to follow suit. Bans on gatherings led to schools, churches, cafes, shops, parks, playgrounds, and non-essential businesses being closed. Many of those broad measures echo 1918-19, but there are some significant differences as well, Jones said. \"The main one being the closure of workplaces. In 1918-19 people continued to go to work every day if they could and probably often even when they couldn't. They shouldn't have been there when they were ill,\ " she said. \"Nobody seemed to take seriously the possibility that you would close down major sectors of the economy.\ " A group of employees from the Canadian Bank of Commerce during the Spanish flu epidemic. (Glenbow Archives) People forced themselves to go to work, for fear of losing their jobs and to make money so they could get treatment for family members who were ill. There was no universal health care and there were few unions. Trials and deportations: 1919 Winnipeg strike leaders were punished first, vindicated later \"So that is very different now, as is the government's willingness in Canada to economically support people during these times,\ " Jones said. \"So there have been some things that have fed into the response we're seeing now.\ " In this 1918 photo, made available by the Library of Congress, volunteer nurses from the American Red Cross tend to influenza patients in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium, used as a temporary hospital. (Edward A. 'Doc' Rogers/Library of Congress) Another difference between 1918-19 and 2020 is that the global health system now crucial to the COVID-19 response did not exist a century ago, points out Michael Bresalier, a lecturer at Swansea University in the United Kingdom. An expert in the history of disease — and a friend of Jones — Bresalier posted an article on the website History and Policy, noting the World Health Organization was not founded until 1948. So nothing existed during the Spanish flu to advise governments, help them align their approaches, or facilitate the sharing of vital information and resources. Countries were left to piece together their own approaches.   Headlines proclaim the impact of the Spanish flu in Winnipeg on Oct. 26, 1918. (Manitoba Free Press)Homes where people were believed to have come in contact with the flu were ordered to place placards in the windows. Many people didn't report their symptoms in order to avoid the stigma of having a sign. (Library of Congress) An estimated one-third of the world's population was infected with the Spanish flu, resulting in at a death toll estimated to have been at least 50 million, but possibly twice that.  Government reporting was poor and there were many people who refused to see a doctor for fear of the stigma attached to having the virus. Some deaths were recorded only by church parishes, not public health officials. And in some countries, no reporting was done at all. IODE convalescent hospital at the corner of Broadway and Donald, where soldiers recuperating from Spanish flu were housed. (Archives of Manitoba) One in six Canadians contracted the infection and some 55,000 died. In Winnipeg, there were more than 1,200 deaths out of a population of 183,000.    The numbers for COVID-19 continue to climb across the world, but as of April 10, more than 1.6 million cases had been reported in 185 countries and territories, resulting in over 98,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 21,000 cases had been confirmed in Canada as of April 10, with more than 540 deaths. Historical photo of the 1918 Spanish influenza ward at Camp Funston, Kansas, showing the many patients ill with the flu. (U.S. Army photographer/Wikimedia Commons) A challenge that surfaced in 1918, and could again, is maintaining the strategies to slow the spread of the virus as the isolation drags on, said Jones. During the Spanish flu, \"the public health officer in Winnipeg faced a lot of pressure to end the closures because they were affecting the local economy in certain ways and they were certainly disrupting everyday life,\ " she said. That officer has to negotiate a deluge of messages from the federal government and provincial government, the best scientific practices, the state of the public mindset, and pressure from the business sector, Jones said. That pressure mounts when the number of new cases starts falling. This 1918 poster, issued by the Alberta Provincial Board of Health, provides information on Spanish flu and instructions on how to make a mask. (Glenbow Archives) Jones understands the impulse to get back to normal, to  think things aren't so bad, when that happens. But a drop in new cases doesn't necessarily mean the virus has weakened — it often means the measures put in place by government and health officials are working. That makes it difficult for people understand the disease is still extremely dangerous. \"We just have to keep repeating the message,\ " Jones said. \"I'm always reminded that with the [Spanish] flu pandemic there were measures that could have been taken that weren't.\ " People also need to remember that beyond the battlefield, the Spanish flu hit the world in three waves. The first, in spring of 1918, was generally mild and resulted in few deaths, The second, in the fall, was highly contagious and arrived with a vengeance. It led to death within just a few days, sometimes within hours, of someone showing symptoms. A map lists how the Spanish Influenza affected Winnipeg's neighbourhoods in 1918. (City of Winnipeg Archives) The third wave occurred during the winter and into the spring of 1919, and was more lethal than the first, but less so than the second. By summer of 1919, the pandemic nearly vanished — not because it was cured, but because those infected died or developed immunity. Even then, some places in Canada experienced pockets of it into 1920, Jones said. \"So it really does become the question: Is that what this is going to look like and how can we plan for that? All of that is a big unknown for us now and unknowns are not comfortable for anyone,\ " she said. \"On the bright side, everyone working in public health right now is learning every day about the disease and ideally, they're buying time, [so] should the disease return in a more serious way … they will have more tools in their tool box.\ " Insurmountable chaos: How 2 soldiers stopping in Winnipeg helped lead to 1,200 deaths from Spanish FluLessons for today from the Spanish flu of 1918Hidden TreasuresTiny vial holds last link to deadly outbreak
  Ontario Premier Doug Ford's mother-in-law, a resident of a Toronto long-term care home ravaged by COVID-19, has tested positive for the disease. The premier's office confirmed the diagnosis on Thursday afternoon, shortly after Ford wrapped up his daily news briefing on the novel coronavirus. During the news conference, a visibly shaken Ford paused to gather himself after recounting images and stories of families with loved ones in long-term care, before pledging to improve the system that's been hard hit by the pandemic. \"I recognize the system is broken,\" he later said. WATCH: Doug Ford reflects on the dire situation in Ontario's long-term care homes \"My heart breaks for the people and their families,\" premier says at daily COVID-19 news conference 1:06 Ontario reported 634 newly-confirmed cases of COVID-19 Thursday, while hospitalizations from the disease rose only slightly and the number of patients in intensive care and on ventilators went down.   The new cases bring the total to 12,879, of which slightly more than 51 per cent, or 6,680, are resolved.   Ontario's official death toll now sits at 713, though regional public health units have reported at least 798 deaths. According to the province, 516 of those deaths have occurred in long-term care facilities. Ford's mother-in-law is a resident at the West Park Long-Term Care home, where at least 13 people have died due to COVID-19 as of Thursday. Deaths in Ontario long-term care, retirement homes Here's a breakdown of the number of deaths at long-term care and retirement homes across the province, as compiled by CBC News:   Orchard Villa — 40. Eatonville Care Centre  — 37.   Seven Oaks long-term care home: 32. Altamont Community Care Centre — 28 residents and 1 staff. Pinecrest Nursing Home — 28. Anson Place Care Centre — 27.

Ontario rolls out a more detailed reporting system On Thursday, the Ministry of Health also changed how it is reporting on COVID-19 in long-term care and retirement homes. It is now providing figures consolidated directly from the Ministry of Long-term Care, which the province says will lead to more timely information when its daily update is published each morning. The previous system was hamstrung by lag times in how the data was collected and eventually compiled, thus offering only a partial picture of the current situation. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayINTERACTIVEFind the COVID-19 benefits and programs relevant to you The change comes one day after public health officials said they plan to test all 78,000 residents and 56,000 health-care workers in long-term care homes, despite previously resisting such a measure. Ford also called for military backup for five of the hardest-hit nursing homes, though the province has not announced which facilities those will be. This morning, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair said on Twitter that Ford's request for support from Canadian Armed Forces personnel has been approved. \"Long-term care is a unique vulnerability in this pandemic,\ " Blair said. In his own daily COVID-19 briefing, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the situation in long-term care facilities throughout the country \"unacceptable\" and that \"we need to to better.\" \"We are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders — the greatest generation who built this country,\" he told reporters.   There are currently outbreaks in 132 long-term care facilities in Ontario, or just over a fifth of the 626 homes province-wide. Some 2,189 residents have been infected by the novel coronavirus, while 1,058 staff members have tested positive. Enhanced testing, screening for other vulnerable residents The province also announced on Thursday a new plan to protect vulnerable residents outside of long-term care settings. Facilities where the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 is higher include homeless shelters, and the providers of services for Indigenous residents, survivors of domestic violence, people with developmental disabilities and children.    Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, said the new \"vulnerable populations COVID-19 action plan\" will go into effect within the next 48 hours. The new strategy includes enhanced screening of residents, staff and visitors at those facilities, in addition to more testing for COVID-19. Smith said the new policies will help \"stabilize outbreaks in many of these settings.\" ICU cases, patients on ventilators dip slightly The total number of people battling COVID-19 in Ontario hospitals increased slightly, up to 887 from 878. But the number of those cases being treated in intensive care units went down from 243 to 233, as did the number of patients on ventilators, which dropped to 185 from 192. AnalysisFord mused about 'loosening' restrictions in May, but getting Ontario back to normal not that simple Further, the province says it processed 10,214 novel coronavirus tests since its last update. In a briefing two weeks ago, public health officials said they hoped to be doing up to 12,000 tests daily by today. Another 6,757 samples are still waiting to tested. Meanwhile, the province has extended a number of pandemic emergency orders that had been set to expire. The orders mean the closure of parks and recreational areas, non-essential workplaces and restaurants will continue until at least May 6. The extension also keeps in place restrictions that limit staff to working in only one long-term care or retirement home. 
  An ER doctor and a library on Nova Scotia's South Shore have teamed up to create a special training tool as doctors across the province prepare to treat more sick COVID-19 patients who may need mechanical ventilators to breathe. The Lunenburg branch of the South Shore Public Libraries has used its 3D printer to make three hard plastic models of a human airway for a doctor who works in town at Fishermen's Memorial Hospital. \"Emergency physicians around the world are in the same boat, which is trying to be as prepared as possible for whatever comes,\" said Dr. Thomas Dietz. Dietz was recently researching ways to brush up his skills at intubating a patient who needs a ventilator. Intubation is often done through the mouth and down the throat, but sometimes that is not possible.   In those cases, doctors must cut into the area below the Adam's apple to insert a breathing tube. According to Dietz, doctors may have only \"one, maybe two\" chances at getting the procedure correct with the sickest patients. Nova Scotia removes travel from COVID-19 testing requirements'We have to be prepared' : Surge in need for mental health supports anticipated \"This is a procedure emergency room physicians are trained to do, but don't do frequently. And I think the informal statistics are once in your career,\" he said. Dietz said he has not performed the procedure for roughly eight or 10 years, so he was anxious to practise. During research, he found a design for a 3D-printed model of a human airway on a website for emergency room doctors, and reached out to his local library for help. Dr. Thomas Dietz wanted to practise inserting a ventilator through the trachea, a procedure that does not come up every day in ER medicine.   (Steve Lawrence/CBC) \"We've printed all sorts of things over the years that we've had a 3D printer, but this ranks right up there,\" said Christina Pottie, the South Shore Public Libraries' community engagement co-ordinator.   Dietz sent Pottie the publicly available file of the airway and she got to work printing it off.   The South Shore library branches are closed to the public, but a skeleton staff are still working to fulfil requests from the public and Pottie was able to drop the model off to Dietz the same evening. \"It feels remarkably similar to a real human neck in terms of trying to find the landmarks, the lumps and bumps that guide you to where you need to make your incision,\ " Dietz said.   The model is tube shaped and has a hole at the correct insertion point. During practice, the doctor wraps the model in gauze to represent soft tissue, then wraps the whole thing in a plastic bag. The doctor can use a scalpel to cut into the right spot.   Dietz took the model to Fishermen's Memorial, where he left it at the ER doctors' station for his colleagues to practise on. He dropped off another to South Shore Regional Hospital in nearby Bridgewater. Christina Pottie poses with one of the South Shore Public Libraries' 3D printers.   (Submitted by Christina Pottie) \"The general consensus seems to be that it's a really cool thing,\" he said. \"It's really easy to use , it's really easy to visualize what you're doing after you've looked at this model.\"  Dietz said he thinks often about the risk to himself, his colleagues, and his family, but being able to practise made him feel more prepared for what is coming.   \"The first time I used this model, it just helped a great deal with the stress of, what if I have to do this,\" he said. Fishermen's Memorial Hospital in Lunenburg, N.S. (Steve Lawrence/CBC) Pottie is willing to print more models if other doctors want them, and she's proud the library was able to help.   \"It was really exciting, just to know that in some little way we could help. And to know that right here, locally in Lunenburg on the South Shore,\ " Pottie said.   \"You didn't have to go to a university, to an engineering department to ask, 'Hey, could you print this for us?' Just right here in our public library we could do this for him.\ " MORE TOP STORIES COVID-19 prompts ban on at-sea observers from Canadian fishing vesselsMarine Atlantic job cuts gone too far, ferry workers' union saysPlan to designate future Cogswell energy system a utility faces oppositionLunenburg lobster captain sells directly to consumers to stay afloat during COVID-19Halifax sewers step up, donating hundreds of face masks to care homes
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  Anthony Dalla Bona admits he was a little hesitant to travel to Peru in March, but says when he left Canada to visit the South American country, there were no travel bans in place. At the time, the travel consultant said, Peru only had a handful of confirmed cases of COVID-19. So when an opportunity arose to travel for work, Dalla Bona said he had little reason to avoid visiting.   On March 15, however, just one day after Dalla Bona landed in Cusco — a city in the southeastern part of the nation — Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra went on television to declare a national lockdown, closing the country's border to international travellers.   \"Peru is one of, I think, the quickest and most dramatic responses to how they were treating quarantine,\ " Dalla Bona said. \"They immediately closed all airports for commercial traffic. They closed the land borders. They locked down the streets.\" Though Anthony Dalla Bona and other guests were quarantined to their hostel, he says spirits remained high. (Submitted by Anthony Dalla Bona) Over the next few days, Dalla Bona said Peruvian officials began releasing \"rules and protocols and policies\" about how to handle the lockdown.   For Dalla Bona, that meant spending the next few weeks stuck in Cusco, largely unable to leave his hostel, other than for essentials like groceries and medicine.   \"That was the first week or so of my quarantine,\ " he said. \"[I] really had a lot of fun. I was enjoying South America [and] I got to meet lots of cool people.\" Countries around the world soon began calling home residents — including Canadian citizens abroad.   CBC Windsor April 21 COVID-19 update : 4 more people have diedOntario's COVID-19 death toll climbs to 698, with 250 people in ICU \"However, getting home was not quite that simple,\ " Dalla Bona said. \"Since there were no commercial planes out of Peru, the only way you could leave and go back to your country is if they organized a repatriation flight for you.\ " And though the Canadian government organized a total of seven flights out of Peru, Dalla Bona said those planes were leaving out of Lima, the capital city, not Cusco. \"There were no commercial flights and we weren't allowed to take a bus, we weren't allowed to drive, all the cities were shut down,\ " he said. \"It kind of created a little bit of a logistical hurdle for us to get on these flights home.\ " About one week after the national lockdown, however, things became even more complicated for Dalla Bona and the approximately 160 other people quarantined in his hostel.   When the Peruvian health ministry in Cusco found out ... they had a pretty big reaction.- Anthony Dalla Bona That's because two hostel guests had become sick enough to warrant a visit from doctors to conduct a COVID-19 test, eventually testing positive for coronavirus.   \"These people were not terribly ill, but they definitely had a cough and they reported symptoms, but they were totally OK and healthy the whole time,\ " Dalla Bona said. \"But when the Peruvian health ministry in Cusco found out that we had positive cases in the hostel … they had a pretty big reaction.\" Military officers were soon stationed outside of the hostel, and no one was allowed to leave — not even for essentials. \"Everything had to be brought in,\" Dalla Bona said. \"We pretty much stayed in that hostel without leaving for the next four weeks.\ " After flying from Cusco to Lima, Anthony Dalla Bona boarded a charter Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, Germany. (Submitted by Anthony Dalla Bona) Still, repatriation efforts continued, with more and more hostel guests getting the chance to leave Peru and return home.   \"But it was difficult for Canada,\" Dalla Bona said. \"There were nine of us Canadians who were in there for quite a while.\" And when the Canadian government announced on Thursday, April 16 its last repatriation flight out of Lima — until Peru lifts its travel ban — Dalla Bona said he started to get a little nervous.   \"We're like, well, maybe there'll be another repatriation flight, or maybe we can just get on the repatriation flight with another country,\" he said. \"The Americans all got out of Peru pretty fast.\ " Canadian trapped in Peru amid COVID-19 lockdown worried about his HIV medicationsWindsorite stuck in Morocco mentally preparing for extended stay, despite improved condition Dalla Bona said his concern grew further when he learned that the Peruvian government planned on stopping all repatriation flights on April 22.   Hope, however, came around 10 p.m. local time on Friday, April 17. \"We all got into a pretty good habit of, when our embassies told us something, you immediately share it with everybody else,\ " Dalla Bona said. \"So we were hearing from the German embassy that they had managed to get a plane into Cusco and the Germans might be going home, if they can get the right approvals and they can circumvent all the logistics in Cusco.\ " The Dutch embassy soon said citizens would be permitted on that German flight, followed by the Swiss and Polish embassies.   Anthony Dalla Bona, along with other passengers, on the Lufthansa flight from Lima to Frankfurt. (Submitted by Anthony Dalla Bona) \"And then eventually [we heard] from the Canadian embassy that we were able to go,\" Dalla Bona said. \"They told us the next morning … pack your stuff, check out of your hostel, because you're going to go on this flight with the Germans.\ " On Saturday, April 18, Dalla Bona boarded a flight from Cusco to Lima. A Lufthansa charter took passengers from Lima to Frankfurt, and Dalla Bona was able to board an Air Canada flight to Toronto, where family were waiting for him in Pearson International Airport on Monday, April 20.   \"When we landed, I've got pictures of us just applauding and just being so thankful,\ " Dalla Bona said. \"It's a real privilege to be home.\ " Now back in Windsor, Dalla Bona will spend the next two weeks isolating with his mother.    I'm very thankful ... for the [hostel] staff that were able to stay behind and really take care of us.- Anthony Dalla Bona He said he's immensely thankful for everyone who cared for him while abroad, as well as those who worked to get him home, including his friends and family, as well as the Canadian government and the Canadian embassy in peru.   \"I'm very thankful and all of the guests are really thankful for the [hostel] staff that were able to stay behind and really take care of us,\" he said. \"Cleaning the hostel … keeping our rooms cleans and doing things like laundry, they were a big part of that, but also just feeding us. There was a kitchen staff that stayed and made three meals a day for the whole hostel.\" \"They kept us healthy and alive and we would've had a really bad time without them.\ " In total, Dalla Bona spent 42 days in Peru, and 35 days in the hostel in Cusco. 
  Not being able to be with a child at the hospital during an emergency would be a nightmare for any parent. Now imagine having a child admitted to the intensive care unit, with a breathing tube down her throat — and not being able to be with her due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. That's the situation Regina's Chasity Delorme found herself in this past weekend. Her daughter, Jayda Delorme, was diagnosed with epilepsy two years ago — so the family knows what to look out for when she has seizures, and they do not usually need to call an ambulance.   But Chasity Delorme says the seizure Jayda had this past Friday was different.   \"I noticed her behaviour changing. … It usually happens very quickly, so sometimes there's not a lot of time to react,\ " the single mother of three said.   \"I was already fearful of what was actually happening. It wasn't until I got to the hospital that I realized how serious it was.\ " Jayda Delorme, left, goes home with her mother, Chasity, after being hospitalized for three nights in the ICU following multiple life-threatening seizures. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook) Jayda had had a seizure earlier in the week — and  Delorme knew that because of visitor restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, if her daughter needed to be hospitalized, she would not be able to be by her side.   \"The one thing that I fear, happened. And that's what made it even more traumatizing for me,\" Chasity Delorme said.   Jayda was rushed to the hospital, where doctors determined she had suffered multiple seizures.   \"It was traumatic. I couldn't run out of the room to go and stand beside her to hold her hand,\" said Delorme. \"I couldn't be there to talk to the doctors or the nurses and whoever was treating her. I wasn't there to tell them, 'This is not normal.'\ " Jayda said that Friday morning was like any other before the seizure.  She only remembers going in and out of consciousness, with nurses behind a window — but no family around.   \"I couldn't really know what was happening,\" said Jayda.   \"It's weird waking up and … looking at your body and seeing a bunch of bruises and wondering how you got them.\ " Some of Jayda Delorme's photos from her stay in hospital, which she had to do alone because of COVID-19 restrictions. (Jayda Delorme/Facebook ) Delorme said that she eventually got to talk to a social worker and then a doctor, who told her about her daughter's status.   \"The doctor said, 'The positive part of this is that that we stopped the seizures by giving her the breathing tube, because now the oxygen is getting to her brain,\ " she said. \"And that's what saved her life.\ " She was told that if Jayda hadn't been in the hospital, the seizures could have been fatal. Knowing that her daughter could have died — but was saved by the doctor, nurses, and paramedics  — still makes Delorme emotional.   \"That's where the life-saving part comes in, and the devastation,\ " she said. \"Because I had this realization that my daughter's life was just saved, you know? But I couldn't be there now, to help her recover.\" Jayda Delorme's family made these signs for her to see while in the hospital. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook) But Delorme said that the doctor who told her about the seizures had been stopped waited a few moments to tell her more.   \"You could tell he was waiting  … because he knew that my reaction would be even worse.\ "  Jayda had been put into an induced coma, the doctor said, with a breathing tube down her throat, and had been admitted into the intensive care unit at Regina General Hospital. Knowing that her daughter went through all of that — and was now alone at the hospital — left Delorme inconsolable. \"There was no communicating with me at that point. I was hyperventilating. I was having an anxiety attack.\ "  She said the social workers who stepped in were helpful and comforting — from a distance. They could not touch her, or even be near her when they offered her some water, she said — which she understands. \"It was really awkward in that way, but I mean, I knew that they were trying their best, and I could feel their comforting energy, and the disappointment that they couldn't sit beside me,\ " she said.   Jayda Delorme is an artist and high school student.   (Jayda Delorme/Facebook ) \"As her mother, I needed to be close to her, so I would sit in the parking lot, just so I could be close to her,\ " Delorme said. \"I feel like I was her voice, and you know, it was because of this virus … it's taken away an essential piece of her medical care.\ "  Delorme said she was told that because Jayda — who recently turned 18 — is an adult, she could not go into the hospital with her. She understands that technicality, she said, but as a self-described \"helicopter mom\" and \"mama bear,\ " she worries about her three children. \"Even though she is one month into being 18, all my abilities of being the voice of her parent were taken away,\" she said. \"She depends on me in all aspects of her life because she's still learning.\" 'Am I going to see anyone again?' : Hospital patients isolated from loved ones as COVID-19 stops family visitsPremier Moe to address province live on Wednesday night, unveil 'Re-Open' plan ThursdaySupport flowing into northern community of La Loche where outbreak has been recorded at long-term care home Delorme describes her daughter as a talented artist who is caring and loves singing, creating art, and beading.   \"She's always thinking about other people. She's just she's a very talented, and colourful, and soft-spoken at the same time.\ " Since her daughter was in an induced coma, and Delorme could not go into the hospital over the weekend, she decided to do something to show Jayda she was not alone.   She and her two other children, along with a few supporters, made signs and stood outside the hospital in hopes that Jayda could see them.   She did.   Jayda's family show their love to her through messages on signs outside the hospital. (Chasity Delorme/Facebook ) \"I felt lots of comfort just seeing them for the first time,\" said Jayda. \"It helped a lot.\ " She said that although she does not use social media that much, FaceTiming and reading Facebook comments and other messages online have helped her feel less alone. \"It brought lots of comfort and joy, knowing I had all these people by my side.\"  Jayda was allowed to go home three days later, and is now recuperating with her family.   Jayda said it usually takes her a few days to get back to normal after having a seizure, but she is just thankful to be home.   The mother and daughter are thankful for the paramedics that showed up, the doctors, and nurses that helped — but also Native Services at the hospital, who worked as a liaison with the family, checking up on Jayda when Delorme could not.   They even helped Delorme and her family, who are from Cowessess First Nation, find an elder to speak to  — remotely. \"We prayed in the car,\ " Delorme said, while connected by phone to the elder. \"She was like, 'OK, now I'm lighting this smudge, and I'm grabbing my feather, and pray in your way. …' She started praying in our language, and that was the most beautiful part because it was so comforting,\ " Delorme said.   \"So it was a virtual prayer. It was, you know, not the same — but extremely helpful at that moment.\ "
  In Houston, the second week of March usually marks a highlight on the city's business calendar, a few days when the city hosts political and business leaders from around the world at what is arguably the most important energy conference of the year. This year, organizers pulled the plug on CERAWeek —  just days before it was set to begin — because of fears of the spread of COVID-19.   It was a sign of things to come. The last week has been devastating for many oil producers in North America. An oil price war launched between Saudi Arabia and Russia — combined with growing coronavirus fears — rattled markets to the core and sent energy prices spiralling to their lowest levels in years. While Canada's energy sector has struggled in recent years, Texas has been a haven as the home to one of the hottest oil plays in the world, the Permian Basin. Companies from Alberta have shifted resources to the state in a bid to keep going. But now it seems few can hide from a price collapse that no one seems certain about how long, or deep, it can go — even in the Lone Star state. Here's how the last week unfolded as people in the oilfields reacted to one of the worst periods in the industry with oil markets in a free fall. In this community, talk about the plunge in oil prices is the common conversation. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) Sunday, March 8 All 76 seats were full on a regional jet flight from Houston to the airport nestled between the cities of Midland and Odessa in West Texas. There was little conversation on the late Sunday evening journey. Asian markets had already opened for trading and oil prices were tanking, falling by as much as 31 per cent. This part of Texas is the heart of the Permian Basin, the largest and hottest oil play on the continent. This area isn't a tourist attraction but rather communities solely focused on the oilpatch. People here either work in the oilfield or cater to the sector by selling trucks to oil companies and teaching oilfield kids. That's why everyone on the flight knew the week ahead was going to be grim. Monday, March 9 Around 9:30 in the morning, half a dozen trucks are waiting their turn to fill up on mud. The substance is used in drilling oil wells throughout the area. Hour after hour, oil prices keep falling and it is the talk all around the plant. Otherwise, operations are unchanged at the AES Drilling Fluids facility in the town of Kermit as business remains brisk. The parent company is Calgary-based CES Energy Solutions, which has shifted more of its focus to Texas in recent years as oilpatch activity has flowed to the Permian. Trucks are loaded up one after another with fluids for drilling rigs throughout the area. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) Gary Lankford is busy checking in with clients to gauge their attitudes and get a sense of their potential plans. Lankford is the company's vice-president of Permian Basin development. He grew up in Texas and this is his 40th year working in the oilfield. By his guess, he's experienced seven significant price crashes in the industry, but he admits the wisdom earned does little to anticipate what this depression will be like.   \"I think every one is different. This one is going to be a little different because it's dropping so fast. The fact that you think you're prepared for it — nah, you never are,\ " he said. With every spare minute he has, Lankford calls another client to check in. There is little panic on the other end of the phone, he said. Still, the two big questions are how bad will this be and how long will it last. \"Several years ago my wife and I were in Las Vegas when Frank Sinatra passed away. I said it was kind of like being in the Vatican when the pope passed away. They actually turned the lights off on the strip for two minutes,\ " Lankford said.  \"Being here in Midland with what we're seeing with OPEC, Russia and oil prices, this may be the equivalent of Frank Sinatra dying. I hope not.\ " By day's end, oil prices fall by as much as 30 per cent, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron stock are down more than 12 per cent. Canadian oilsands companies are blasted, too.  Suncor losing more than 17 per cent of its value. Cenovus closing down 51 per cent. A truck begins to pull away after filling up with mud at the AES Drilling Fluids facility. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) Tuesday, March 10 It's before 9 a.m. and Dave Hoffman is driving through foggy west Texas oilfield backroads. The Permian Basin extends into New Mexico and that's where one of its drilling rigs is working around the clock. Hoffman is from Camrose, Alberta, but spends two-thirds of his time in Texas overseeing operations for Calgary-based Citadel Drilling. Traffic is heavy with workers and heavy trucks navigating the area. He is convinced the company can withstand a period of depressed oil prices after surviving through several years of tough prices in Western Canada, before all of Citadel Drilling's rigs were moved to Texas two years ago. \"We've overcome a lot. We've come here and really done a good job and made a name for ourselves,\" said Hoffman.   Citadel Drilling has six rigs in the Permian basin, including this one near Jal, New Mexico. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) The 2,000 horsepower drilling rig, named  \"The Commander,\" is hard to miss outside the town of Jal, New Mexico, with little vegetation in the desert to hide the towering red, white and gold machine. The majority of the workers are Canadian. They fly in from across Canada to work rotations of 20 days on, 10 days off. Depending on what decisions the oil producers make, drilling activity could be impacted. For now, at least, there aren't any signs of disruption on the rig. \"No , I don't think we've recognized any real change.\" said Hoffman. \"Everyone is trying to feel out the process and see what's happening.\ " This Citadel Drilling rig operates around the clock with workers alternating 12-hour shifts. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) That evening, the crowd at the PNG Stadium in Houston is glaringly sparse. The annual rodeo is in full swing, but the majority of people are staying far away as the coronavirus threat increases. Still, competitors like bareback rider Pascal Isabelle from Okotoks, Alberta, bring some life into the giant 72,000 seat arena. \"That's a buckin' son of a gun,\ " yells the announcer. Jeremy Thompson watches the rodeo event from one end of the arena and sees parallels to what the oilpatch is going through, especially the bull riding. \"You do a lot of work in the chute to get that bull where you want it to go. and then you come out and it turns the wrong way and you're in the dirt. You're picking your hat up, dusting it off and wondering what's next,\ " he said. Thompson regularly travels to different parts of the U.S. to meet with clients and show off the software developed by the company he works for, Calgary-based Spira Data. With the majority of the American oilpatch focused in Texas, he easily knows his way around Houston and other cities in the state. For him, this week has been eventful as some customers are too preoccupied with the price meltdown and cancel their meetings with Thompson, while others seem more eager to move ahead with projects as they see technology as a way of being more efficient in their operations. The following day, the rest of the rodeo is cancelled due to rising coronavirus concerns, marking the first shutdown of the Houston Rodeo in its nearly 90-year history. The Houston Rodeo would eventually be cancelled, just like most major sports event in North America. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) Wednesday, March 11 At this point, oil prices are 40 per cent lower than they were a month ago. It's the middle of an incredibly tumultuous week and at the Houston office of research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, analysts are looking into the financial health of companies to see which are best suited to survive a prolonged downturn, while also revising their forecasts and models for oil production and demand. After returning from a meeting with Exxon Mobil earlier in the day, analyst Brandon Davis sits down for an interview to explain all the developments he is seeing in the sector. \"We've talked to a lot of clients, both from the company side and investor side as well, hedge funds and things like that. I think the only thing everyone can agree upon is they don't know. It's an uncertain situation. Who knows what will happen with the Middle East and Russia. Maybe something will emerge.\ " In a sustained low-cost scenario, the larger producers are likely better off, while most distressed companies will likely be either junior or mid-sized firms. The oilfield service sector is going to have a rougher ride too. At this point, the safest thing for the oilpatch is to plan for low prices for the rest of the year, said Davis. Then if prices do recover, companies \"have excess inventory you can bring online in that scenario.\ " It's another tough day for stock market investors who are awash in red ink with major stock markets down by between three and five per cent. Economic forecasts for Alberta point to recession, thousands of job losses Alberta premier says layoffs loom as oilpatch warns of 'catastrophic' impact from low prices Thursday, March 12 As stock markets open, there is red across the board again, this time as investors reel from U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement the night before to restrict travel from Europe. It's another blow to the oilpatch as it \"just adds to the negative demand impetus,\" said Ken Medlock, from inside his office at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University in Houston. Medlock already knows of several people who have cancelled flights and plan to drive to their spring break ski trips. Still, he anticipates even vehicle traffic will decline in the near future as anxiety grows about being near crowds. On the production side, OPEC and Russia continue to pump more oil and sink prices further. Medlock says they are hoping to force oilpatch bankruptcies in the U.S. and restore more control over the global sector. \"That's the classic market share game. That's what that is,\" he said. Medlock expects consolidation in the Permian and for production to fall this year.   The depths of the oilpatch's woes, though, are difficult to predict. Medlock describes it as a perfect storm with countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia pumping oil with all their might and the coronavirus sapping away demand more and more every day. The virus, in particular, seems to be the greater unknown for the sector. \"Any time you get into a discussion about fear that just embeds massive uncertainty in terms of how consumers are going to respond and what governments are going to do, etc.,\" he said. For now, oilfield activity remains high in the Permian. (Kyle Bakx/CBC) Friday, March 13 The headlines spread across the Wall Street Journal, which arrives at corporate head offices and hotel doorsteps, all focus on the coronavirus, including \"Virus Batters Economy,\" \"In U.S., Threat Upends Daily Life,\" and \"U.S. Hospitals Face Major Challenges.\ " The week ultimately ends just like it began — in surprising fashion. Trump declares the coronavirus a national emergency, the Federal Reserve pours $1.5 trillion into the American stock market and the Bank of Canada makes an unexpected interest rate cut. Stocks jumped across the continent with the Dow up nine per cent and the Toronto Stock Exchange up 10 per cent. Still, the upward swing wasn't enough to salvage one of the worst weeks in the North American stock market's history. Oil edges up slightly to $33.38 US a barrel. It still represents about a 25 per cent drop in one week and there are few clues about what the next week, month or year have in store for the Permian or oilfields across the continent. 
  High flood waters have spilled over and closed a major highway south of the Canada-U.S. border, just days after the Manitoba government announced a high-water warning for the south of the province. The I-29, which runs from the border south through North Dakota, was closed Thursday night due to flooding, according to the North Dakota Department of Transportation. A nearly 40-kilometre stretch, from Manvel — just north of Grand Forks — to Grafton, N.D., is affected by the closure, along with other roads that feed off the I-29. A northbound detour at the Manvel exit begins at US 81 and turns north toward Grafton, then east at ND 17, where drivers can eventually get back on the I-29, the department said.   The southbound detour starts at the Grafton exit and follows ND 17 west to Grafton, before turning south on US 81 and merging with the I-29. Department of Transportation crews began installing an inflatable flood barrier along the I-29 Thursday. The Red River is projected to crest in Grand Forks on Friday and no sooner than April 17 near the border, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.   Flood preparation is already underway in Manitoba, as the projected crest of the Red could top out between 19 and 19.5 feet James, which is a measure of river height at James Avenue in Winnipeg. That level would constitute a moderate flood. Ice jams that formed on the Red River south of Selkirk caused some flooding Wednesday. The Manitoba government activated the Red River Floodway Thursday night after issuing a high-water warning for the Red River, from Emerson to the floodway inlet south of Winnipeg. Groups were out sandbagging properties in St. Norbert Thursday night. WATCH | Volunteers sandbag in St. Norbert as water rises in and around Winnipeg: People helped sandbag properties in St. Norbert Thursday as waters rise on the Red and Assiniboine rivers in and around Winnipeg. 1:02 Manitoba Infrastructure estimates the Red will crest near Emerson between April 15 and 18. The province has released the following crest projections for the Red in other parts of Manitoba:  Morris: April 18-22. Ste. Agathe: April 19-23. Ste.  Adolphe: April 19-23.

  Alberta cosplayers who masquerade as Hollywood's most famous gang of ghost catchers are setting down their proton packs to help in the fight against COVID-19. The volunteers with Alberta Ghostbusters may not be able to help if there's something strange in your neighbourhood, but the movie fans are making their mark in a different way.    They're sewing scrub caps, constructing face shields and using 3D printers to make ear savers — small plastic tabs that prevent masks from cutting into the ears of health-care workers who wear protective gear for hours at a time.   \"Since we're a group mostly composed of prop builders, we figured why can't we build items that are in need for those health-care workers?\" Mario Giguere, the group's president, said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.   \"This has happened all so fast. \"We had a board meeting and decided that helping with COVID-19 in this way was going to be a priority for us this year. Things have just snowballed since then.\ "  Three stacks of ear-saving tabs constructed by volunteers with Alberta Ghostbusters. (Alberta Ghostbusters) Ghostbusters Alberta is a non-profit society which normally dedicates its time to fundraising for children's hospitals at cosplay events across the province. Members craft perfect replicas of the weapons and costumes used in the 1984 blockbuster and dress up as their favourite characters. ' A collaboration' The group was looking forward to a busy season of fundraising when the pandemic hit and events like the Edmonton Expo were cancelled. Members now confined to their homes decided to make themselves useful. \"We thought, we've got to find some creative solutions to help out these hospitals, not just the children's hospitals that we raise money for, but also those front line health-care workers who are really battling COVID for the whole province right now,\" Giguere said. \"We got together to start using our 3D printers and our sewing machines to make these items for these people. And very quickly, this became a collaboration.\" Giguere and his crew have teamed with members of the props team from Ghostbusters: Afterlife. The group befriended the film crew last summer when the movie was being shot in southern Alberta. Cosplay groups from across the province have also signed on to assist in the effort, Giguere said.   Now we can help in a different way.- Mario Giguere As of Monday, the group had 30 volunteers working to fill more than 4,200 orders received through its website. Anyone keen to take part is encouraged to join the ranks, Giguere said.   \"The orders are just flooding in from these front line health-care workers,\ " he said \"It's a lot of hospitals in Edmonton and Calgary mostly, but I'm sure that the word will spread and we might start seeing some more places, too.   \"It's been very encouraging. And as a small group of people, it's really forced us to work hard at meeting these demands.\"    For his part, Giguere has purchased a 3D printer and is pleased to set aside his fight with the fictional villain Gozer the Gozerian. \"It makes me feel great. That's why I joined Alberta Ghostbusters in the first place.   \"Now we can help in a different way.\" The Alberta Ghostbusters group has received hundreds of orders for medical supplies including scrub caps.

  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  New Brunswickers could have their COVID-19 test results within 45 minutes instead of waiting up to two days, starting as early as next week  — provided the province doesn't run out of testing supplies. The Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation's COVID-19 emergency fund is paying for lab upgrades at seven hospitals across the province, which will enable them to analyze tests taken within their communities, said Dr. John Dornan, the Horizon Health Network's chief of staff. Until now, all New Brunswick test swabs have been driven in batches to the lab at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton. Adding GeneXpert instruments to Horizon and Vitalité hospitals in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John will have \"tremendous ramifications,\" said Dornan. Instead of people having to wait between 24 and 48 hours in a COVID-19 unit at a hospital or while self-isolating at home, they will know their results in less than one hour. Poor supply of COVID-19 test kits restrained testing, but province still running outN.B. COVID-19 roundup: Province could run out of test supplies within 1 week \"This is great news for patients, but also a critical improvement when testing our health-care staff,\ " he said.   \"We will now know in 45 minutes whether we need to send staff home or if they can carry on providing the excellent care they do everyday.\" New Brunswick has 91 cases of COVID-19, as of Thursday afternoon, when 10 new cases were announced. Three people remain in hospital, including the first case in intensive care. The province's testing capacity will be \"huge\" once the labs are up and running, likely within a couple of weeks, said Dornan. And the timing \"couldn't be better,\ " he said. It will coincide with a planned ramp-up in testing. \"The whole successes in other parts of the world were done with significant increases in testing when required. We're going to need that in the not too distant future.\" Premier Blaine Higgs said he plans to release COVID-19 projections for New Brunswick in a week. (CBC) On Thursday night, Premier Blaine Higgs told CBC's Power and Politics that New Brunswick could run out of COVID-19 testing supplies within a week with ramped up testing and personal protective equipment within three or four weeks. \"But we have orders that are pending and hoping to arrive,\ " he said. The Moncton lab is conducting about 500 tests a day but has the capacity to perform up to 1,000 tests a day, Higgs said. \"Granted, if we went to 1,000 tests a day we would be looking at supplies needed within about five days,\" the premier said. Testing may target those without symptoms Dornan could not immediately say whether the newly upgraded labs will analyze swabs like the Moncton lab, sputum samples  \"or some other means.\ " But he did say he expects the labs will start testing people in the community who \"might not have very typical symptoms.\ " \"Thus far, we believe that the vast majority of people that have the disease when they're tested have some degree of symptoms,\ " he said. \"But we are worried that when it is more rampant in the community then, you know, is it possible that people will start shedding virus and be asymptomatic?\" Other targeted groups for testing will include people living in homes for seniors and assisted-living facilities, who are considered \"at risk.\ " Dr. John Dornan says seven sites will get an upgrade to determine COVID-19 results much faster, thanks to funding from the Saint John Hospital Foundation. The Foundation is also buying two higher level life support machines known as ECMO. 8:39 New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell called the lab upgrades \"a very positive development.\" \"We're looking at rolling that out late next week, perhaps Thursday,\" she said. The capacity of the labs will vary, Russell said, with the smaller centres expected to handle about 16 test results a day and the larger ones, about 84 daily. The software upgrades and components for existing equipment at the seven labs will cost $525,000, according to the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation. Buying 2 lung machines The foundation is also purchasing two machines to help with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, lung capacity and function can be severely affected. The two portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support systems machines oxygenate the blood, allowing the lungs to rest. The premier thanked the foundation for the donation of the life-saving equipment. It is \"just one example of how the people in this province are coming together to support one another,\ " Higgs said. The total cost of the two ECMO machines is $137,500, the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation said. The foundation's emergency fund, established to be used for areas of greatest need in the province during the pandemic, has seen donations of more than $1.1 million over two weeks. Of that, $1 million was donated by the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation. 
  After some initial challenges, the temporary shelter at the Edmonton Expo Centre now has improved amenities for the hundreds of homeless people using the facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Expo Centre has been used as a day drop-in centre and isolation shelter since late March but the centre's amenities needed to be improved to keep up with the demand.   Last week, one patron told CBC News he hadn't been able to take a shower in more than a week and that laundry facilities were lacking.    City officials scrambling to add showers and laundry facilities at COVID-19 drop-in centre    Previously there were just four shower units available in the drop-in centre and eight units in the isolation centre as well as six washer and dryer units for a facility that serves hundreds. But the centre's facilities have been improved.   Nearly 20 new showers were installed by social agencies and there are now 30 shower stalls throughout the centre. The centre has 13 washer and dryer sets, 40 portable toilets and 28 handwashing sites, the city said.   The city confirmed the shelter was having problems with water supply and mechanics. Jackie Liu, operations director at Boyle McCauley Health Centre, said the portable showers had to be refilled manually and the cold temperatures led to frozen lines. \"This place was put together in a space of four days, so some of these things were just logistical glitches that needed a bit of time,\" he said. Social workers spent much of the first week setting up operations, building computer systems, and getting pharmacy services set up, Liu said. \"We've actually had the opportunity to catch our breath, develop some processes and as all those things become standardized and our staff become more used to working in that space, things are getting a bit better.\"   'Treated like human beings': Bus driver ferries homeless people to Expo Centre during pandemic   The number of clients using the day drop-in side fluctuates between 450 and 650 individuals per day. The centre also has an isolation shelter for anyone who is homeless and exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. As of Wednesday, 62 clients were in that part of the shelter, down from 71 on April 1.   Liu said there was originally some miscommunication about the purpose of the isolation shelter.   \"I think one thing as we get more established is that we've had, I would say, more of the appropriate referrals coming through,\ " Liu said. \"There's less people coming here just for general shelter.\ "   Expo Centre opens to Edmonton's homeless during pandemic   Liu said during the first week or so of operation, people arrived with the belief that the isolation section was an overflow shelter.   And some people showed up who were not deemed homeless, he said.   \"If you're healthy, you don't want to be here,\ " Liu stressed.   Agency workers continue to test those with COVID-related symptoms but due to privacy laws, they cannot reveal how many, if any, have tested positive.

  Not more than two hours after the premier of the Northwest Territories described the COVID-19 pandemic as an \"invisible war we are fighting,\" recruits in that battle have new advice — use disposable or reusable face masks when in public to slow the spread of COVID-19. An unsigned press release Tuesday afternoon from the N.W.T. Office of the Chief Public Health Officer stated that it \"now recommends residents use reusable or disposable cloth face coverings when in public places.\ " According to the press release, although non-medical face masks cannot eliminate all contact with droplets potentially containing the novel coronavirus, they were found to be effective in limiting the droplets to spread further from people who are not aware they have COVID-19.   \"This is a way to help each other help ourselves — if everyone wears face coverings while in public, we can limit the spread of COVID-19.\ " The recommendation follows recent advice from Canada's chief public health officer who said on Monday that Canadians can use non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures to limit the transmission of COVID-19 when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19 According to recent statements from Dr. Kami Kandola, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer, cases of COVID-19 in the N.W.T. have so far been confined to individuals who had returned from travel. There is no so-called community transmission of the virus in the N.W.T. Community transmission of the virus is the spread of an illness with no known link to travel or previously confirmed cases. It can signal a growing number of unreported cases. Some of the masks by Sydney Wolf in Yukon, as Whitehorse sewers make cloth masks to meet high demand. (Submitted by Sydney Wolf) No one from the territory's Department of Health and Social Services was immediately available to comment on the new advice to wear a face mask in public. The press release emphasized that wearing a face mask does not replace previous advice or orders regarding physical distancing, hand washing or self-isolation. The advice also does not apply to employers, or anyone else who must comply with Workers' Safety and Compensation Commission guidelines. Community effort already underway Wilbert Cook, the executive director of the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, said his organization has been working on a project that would see home-made masks made and distributed for free in all communities in the Northwest Territories. Wilbert Cook, the executive director of the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, says a program to get masks made in N.W.T. communities was already underway. (Randall McKenzie/CBC) The timing of Cook's project was coincidental with Tuesday's recommendation. He said the foundation is trying to get one or two people from each community to help sew masks. \"We will provide the material and supplies,\ " Cook said. Cook said he hopes to have work underway within a couple of weeks, but the foundation will need cash and materials to make it happen. \"We're looking for both fabric and cash donations but we're going to be applying to the federal government for funds to implement that project.\" This Yellowknife couple is using 3D printing to make masks more comfortable Do-it-yourself (DIY) efforts such as these fit in with the government recommendation to wear face coverings in public. \"We absolutely encourage these DIY creations and applaud those already setting up sewing clubs,\" states an email from the N.W.T. office of the press secretary. \"[We] encourage residents to tag the government of the Northwest Territories Facebook page and the Twitter account of our chief public health officer Dr. Kami Kandola with photos of them wearing their DIY creations.\" Yukoners sew homemade cloth masks to meet high demand Yes to cotton, no to polyester According to the press release, face coverings could include home-made coverings, but they must:   Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face   Be secured with ties or ear loops   Include multiple layers of fabric   Allow for breathing without restriction   Be able to be washed and machine dried without damage or change to shape with hot temperatures   According to the press release, disposable material such as layers of tissue or paper towels can be used, but should be disposed of after each use. Two 10 x 6 inch sheets of 100 per cent cotton are recommended, with material to fasten behind one's ears or head. Polyester and nylon are not recommended. 
  The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) announced on Thursday that the party's convention to select its presidential nominee will be postponed until the week of Aug. 17. The convention had been originally scheduled for July 13-16. \"In our current climate of uncertainty , we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention,\" said Joe Solmonese, CEO of the DNCC. \"During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health-care professionals and emergency responders.\" The committee said due to the unique situation that many options would be considered if necessary including \"adjusting the convention's format to crowd size and schedule.\ " As in-person campaign events get cancelled in favour of virtual ones, this year’s presidential election sees more campaigning via video and broadcast, and mail-in ballots. 2:03 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden on Wednesday said he believed the convention would not take place in July, but told NBC News that party conventions, primaries and elections were held in other turbulent times. \"We were able to do it in the middle of a Civil War all the way through to World War II and still have public safety,\ " Biden said. \"We're able to do both.\ " The bottom line, Biden has said, is that \"we should listen to the scientists\" and that the 2020 election, from conventions to voting methods, \"may have to be different.\" Tradition dictates that Democrats, as the party out of power, hold their convention first. Republicans are scheduled to gather Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C. Trump vowed to stick to schedule Republicans, meanwhile, are expressing confidence they can pull off their convention as scheduled in August, but party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel still allowed for the possibility that the pandemic could upend plans. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week there was \"no way\" the Republican convention would be moved, but the comments were made before the White House began to talk frankly about grim death toll projections numbering into six figures. AnalysisTrump is more popular than ever, but there's more to the storyBloomberg to transfer $18M to Democratic National Committee Neither Democratic nor Republican leaders want to sacrifice the boost that can result from an enthusiastic convention gathering. Trump thrives on big rallies and has obviously missed that part of his routine amid the coronavirus outbreak. Trump held six rallies between the end of his impeachment trial in early February and March 2, signalling that he was keen on a heavy schedule of campaigning in 2020 ahead of the Nov. 3 election. A traditional convention, with a nationally televised nomination acceptance speech, could be even more critical for Biden, who has been relegated recently to remote television interviews from his Delaware home, unable to draw the kind of spotlight that Trump commands. Several primaries postponed, but not Wisconsin The Democratic race also isn't officially over, another complication. Biden holds a prohibitive delegate lead that makes him the prospective nominee, but Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders remains in the race and insists he has a \"narrow\" path to the nomination. With many states pushing back their primaries, Sanders potentially could block Biden from accruing the required delegate majority until late June, just weeks before the convention. Early voters cast their ballots at the Frank P. Zeidler Municipal Building on March 18 in Milwaukee. Wisconsin officials have not postponed the April 7 presidential primary because of the coronavirus.    (Morry Gash/The Associated Press) According to the New York Times, 15 primary contests have been rescheduled, with dates pushed back into May and June. But Wisconsin still plans to hold its primary on Tuesday April 7. A federal judge signalled Wednesday that he won't postpone or make any major changes to the Wisconsin primary to alleviate concerns that voters and poll workers could contract the coronavirus. \"I'm not sure it's my place to to assume the steps taken by the state or not taken by the state is an impingement on an individual's right to vote. That's what I'm struggling with,\" U.S. District Judge William Conley told attorneys for the Democratic National Committee and a host of liberal-leaning groups that they haven't shown how the pandemic has truly hampered people's voting rights. Hand sanitizer and stickers are set up at the Lincoln Lodge Polling Station in Chicago on March 17 during the recent Illinois primary. All states allow for some form of mail-in voting but Democrats appear more keen on ramping up its use than Republicans. (James Foster/Chicago Sun-Times via AP) Wisconsin poll workers have reportedly been quitting in droves; more than 100 municipalities lack enough staffers to run even a single polling site. Sanders joined a chorus of complaints Wednesday, issuing a statement saying the election should be delayed. Many states ill-prepared for mail-in voting Democrats, including Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, have hopes for using the crisis to expand voting by mail face firm Republican opposition as well as significant logistical challenges. In some states, it would amount to a major revamp of their voting system just eight months before an election. Vote-by-mail boosters already lost the first round of the fight. Democrats tried and failed to insert a broad mandate expanding voting by mail in the last week's federal stimulus bill, a proposal that could cost as much as $2 billion US. Instead, the bill included $400 million to help states adjust elections however they see fit before November. Georgia governor slammed for not knowing asymptomatic people could transmit virusMany COVID-19 cases in New Orleans complicated by underlying health conditions \"Practically every single Tuesday, we see another state reacting to their inability to run their election in the middle of this incredible health care pandemic,\" said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the first state to vote entirely through the mail. Every state already allows some form of voting by mail, but only six Western states are set up to allow all-mail voting in every county, according to Wendy Underhill at the National Conference of State Legislatures.      While Republicans have backed the trend toward mail voting, the party remains suspicious of widespread use of the method.   \"The things they had in there were crazy. They had things — levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again,\ " Trump said of the Democrats in a Fox News intrerview this week. ' Crisis opportunism' Many Republicans argue that a major expansion of mail-in voting opens up new concerns about fraud and security and some see Democrats as trying to take advantage of a crisis. \"Some of these are things that have been kind of partisan issues for a long time and now are being presented as a kind of response to COVID-19,\" said Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. \"I've called that crisis opportunism. I don't think making big policy changes in response to a crisis is the right thing to do.\ " WATCH l U.S. jobless claims continue to soar More than 6.6 million Americans filed for new jobless claims last week, doubling the record amount seen the previous week. That amount itself was four times higher than the previous record.   4:25 There are other, practical hurdles. Mail-in voting requires an expensive upfront investment in machines to process mail ballots, poll workers and election judges to be retrained to use the devices and verify voters' signatures on their envelopes and other wrinkles. \"You can't just flip the switch and go from one system to another,\ " Underhill said. She said official ballots must be printed on durable paper stock, and states may not be able to secure enough for November without sufficient advanced planning. \"You can't just get it at Kinko's.\ " It's also not clear that voting by mail is necessarily pandemic-proof. Mail voting can also delay election counts, especially in California, the largest state in the nation, which allows voters to mail in their ballots on Election Day. The state is still counting votes from its March 3 primary, in part because the virus outbreak has scrambled staffing in county elections offices across the state.

STM restricts ticket purchases to vending machines STM spokesperson Philippe Déry said posters will soon be affixed to buses to explain the following procedures:   Passengers will be expected to have a valid ticket in their possession. The seat behind the driver will be left free at all times. The STM's kiosk at the Montreal airport for the 747 bus line will be closed until further notice.   At least one confirmed COVID-19 case transferred from the Yellow line to the Orange line on March 6. A second infected person used the Metro Green line on March 10. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) In the Metro, the purchase and recharging of tickets will only be done through automatic vending machines. Station agents will be present to inform customers and guide them through these new measures. There are also changes to the STM's taxi-bus service. For the time being, only one person at a time is allowed on each taxi-bus.   \"The faster we contain the virus, the faster we will return to normal life,\ " Plante said, reminding people to respect government recommendations, self-isolate and wash their hands frequently. Accès Montréal offices close, SPVM limits service Plante said requests for construction and occupation permits can already be made online, but all the Accès Montréal offices — customer service counters for residents — will be closed until future notice. Those seeking permits and other services are asked to seek assistance online or call as the city's telephone service, 311, will become the main interface for all questions. The Montreal police service (SPVM) is temporarily closing all of its service counters at neighbourhood police stations, operational centres and other offices to the public, the SPVM announced Tuesday evening. Citizens wishing to contact the police can do so by dialling 911 in the event that immediate assistance is required. Otherwise, residents are encouraged to call their local station, file police reports online or contact their local station. 
  New Brunswickers could have their COVID-19 test results within 45 minutes instead of waiting up to two days, starting as early as next week  — provided the province doesn't run out of testing supplies. The Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation's COVID-19 emergency fund is paying for lab upgrades at seven hospitals across the province, which will enable them to analyze tests taken within their communities, said Dr. John Dornan, the Horizon Health Network's chief of staff. Until now, all New Brunswick test swabs have been driven in batches to the lab at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton. Adding GeneXpert instruments to Horizon and Vitalité hospitals in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John will have \"tremendous ramifications,\" said Dornan. Instead of people having to wait between 24 and 48 hours in a COVID-19 unit at a hospital or while self-isolating at home, they will know their results in less than one hour. Poor supply of COVID-19 test kits restrained testing, but province still running outN.B. COVID-19 roundup: Province could run out of test supplies within 1 week \"This is great news for patients, but also a critical improvement when testing our health-care staff,\ " he said.   \"We will now know in 45 minutes whether we need to send staff home or if they can carry on providing the excellent care they do everyday.\" New Brunswick has 91 cases of COVID-19, as of Thursday afternoon, when 10 new cases were announced. Three people remain in hospital, including the first case in intensive care. The province's testing capacity will be \"huge\" once the labs are up and running, likely within a couple of weeks, said Dornan. And the timing \"couldn't be better,\ " he said. It will coincide with a planned ramp-up in testing. \"The whole successes in other parts of the world were done with significant increases in testing when required. We're going to need that in the not too distant future.\" Premier Blaine Higgs said he plans to release COVID-19 projections for New Brunswick in a week. (CBC) On Thursday night, Premier Blaine Higgs told CBC's Power and Politics that New Brunswick could run out of COVID-19 testing supplies within a week with ramped up testing and personal protective equipment within three or four weeks. \"But we have orders that are pending and hoping to arrive,\ " he said. The Moncton lab is conducting about 500 tests a day but has the capacity to perform up to 1,000 tests a day, Higgs said. \"Granted, if we went to 1,000 tests a day we would be looking at supplies needed within about five days,\" the premier said. Testing may target those without symptoms Dornan could not immediately say whether the newly upgraded labs will analyze swabs like the Moncton lab, sputum samples  \"or some other means.\ " But he did say he expects the labs will start testing people in the community who \"might not have very typical symptoms.\ " \"Thus far, we believe that the vast majority of people that have the disease when they're tested have some degree of symptoms,\ " he said. \"But we are worried that when it is more rampant in the community then, you know, is it possible that people will start shedding virus and be asymptomatic?\" Other targeted groups for testing will include people living in homes for seniors and assisted-living facilities, who are considered \"at risk.\ " Dr. John Dornan says seven sites will get an upgrade to determine COVID-19 results much faster, thanks to funding from the Saint John Hospital Foundation. The Foundation is also buying two higher level life support machines known as ECMO. 8:39 New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell called the lab upgrades \"a very positive development.\" \"We're looking at rolling that out late next week, perhaps Thursday,\" she said. The capacity of the labs will vary, Russell said, with the smaller centres expected to handle about 16 test results a day and the larger ones, about 84 daily. The software upgrades and components for existing equipment at the seven labs will cost $525,000, according to the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation. Buying 2 lung machines The foundation is also purchasing two machines to help with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, lung capacity and function can be severely affected. The two portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support systems machines oxygenate the blood, allowing the lungs to rest. The premier thanked the foundation for the donation of the life-saving equipment. It is \"just one example of how the people in this province are coming together to support one another,\ " Higgs said. The total cost of the two ECMO machines is $137,500, the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation said. The foundation's emergency fund, established to be used for areas of greatest need in the province during the pandemic, has seen donations of more than $1.1 million over two weeks. Of that, $1 million was donated by the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation. 
  Before Washington state lifts its stay-at-home order, public health workers in Seattle's King County want to be ready to douse any new sparks of infection. That task, they say, requires at least 20 more investigators to call people who test positive for the coronavirus, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine. Without the extra help, the workers insist, the state can't possibly be ready to resume normal everyday activities. \"We are trying to build these teams and processes in the midst of a crisis,\" county health spokesperson Sharon Bogan said. The challenge extends well beyond Seattle. As federal officials weigh how and when to reopen the country, experts say the United States does not have enough public health workers to suppress another outbreak, especially those qualified to do contact tracing, the critically important effort to find people who may have been exposed to the virus. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated it could require 100,000 people, while Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), believes the number could be as high as 300,000. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 16Meet Canada's public health detectives fighting the COVID-19 spread Both estimates represent a daunting number given that the combined federal, state and local public health workforce has been shrinking and is now probably less than 280,000, according to some estimates. The budget approved by Congress for the CDC has fallen by 10 per cent between 2010 and 2019 when adjusted for inflation, according to the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health, and that has had a trickle-down effect at state and county levels. The problem has inspired some novel ideas, including enlisting Peace Corps volunteers, furloughed social workers and public health students. San Francisco is training librarians, medical students and people who work for the city attorney's office. WATCH | Canada's challenges with contact tracing : Canada is calling for more people to help investigate coronavirus cases. 2:33 While the exact number of workers needed is a subject of debate, a top federal health official this week acknowledged the mandate to find many more. \"Everybody agrees that our public health capacity at the local and state level is not ready to take this on at a very large scale without reinforcements,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC, who oversees the agency's coronavirus response work. The extra workers would help conduct testing, isolate sick cases and trace everyone those sick people had contact with. New funds approved for response efforts It's crucial that such a system be in place before government officials ease physical-distancing guidelines, reopen schools or lift stay-at-home orders, said Frieden. \"If we have explosive spread when we reopen, we'll have to close again. That will be very damaging, not just economically but from a health standpoint,\ " he said. The U.S. government has funnelled about $800 million US to states for coronavirus response work that can include contact tracing. And on top of hundreds of staff sent to states to help with coronavirus work, the CDC has already assembled \"community protection teams\" of six to 12 people each to do contact tracing and investigate tools that could help with it. Some have already been deployed to states where spread of the virus has been relatively low. A smartphone belonging to Rhode Island native Drew Grande shows notes he made for contact tracing on Wednesday. Grande began keeping a log on his phone at the beginning of April, after he heard Gov. Gina Raimondo urge residents to start out of concern about the spread of the coronavirus.    (Steven Senne/The Associated Press) Tiny Rhode Island has nearly 100 people \"focused on nothing but contact tracing,\" reaching out to hundreds of contacts of infected people each day, Gov. Gina Raimondo told reporters. She has urged all state residents to take a minute each evening to write down who they physically encountered that day and where those encounters took place. \"If I'm going out to the store, I'll put the date, what store I went to and then the time I was there,\ " said Drew Grande, 40, of Cranston, R.I. He started a contacts diary on a note-taking app on his phone after he heard the governor's request. Contact tracing has changed over the last few months in the U.S. When the first handful of infections were being identified, teams of 20 or more might be assigned to each confirmed case. Investigations would often start with a staffer or two doing an in-person interview at a hospital bedside. Disease trackers might spend hours asking a sick person and that person's relatives who they had been in contact with since symptoms surfaced. In-person interviews are often better, said Isaac Ghinai, a CDC disease tracker assigned to work with Chicago's health department. \"There's a value to looking someone in the eye. You can build a relationship face to face that you can't always do by phone,\ " he said. Some people are comfortable sharing personal details over the phone but others \"require more cajoling.\ " With hundreds of new cases emerging each day in Chicago, that kind of attention to individual infections has largely stopped. Instead, the priority is large groups of people who are particularly vulnerable, like those at nursing homes or homeless shelters. Many new confirmed cases are not being investigated, and when they are, the interviews may be done by only two or three people, and over the phone, Ghinai said. Lack of testing materials, too Could there be a digital solution? Apple and Google are teaming up on a contact-tracing app, and other efforts use Bluetooth to gather data from phones that came close to an infected person. Seattle scientist Trevor Bedford has developed a digital interview that public health departments can use if they don't have enough people trained in contact tracing. Whatever the solution, it will take a while. People have to be tested and diagnosed before contact tracing kicks into gear, and testing remains limited in many parts of the country. This week, the Association of American Medical Colleges sent a letter to the White House Coronavirus Task Force saying that testing materials and machines remain in short supply. The coronavirus doesn't discriminate, but society does — and the results in the U.S. are deadlyApple, Google to harness phones for COVID-19 infection tracking President Donald Trump has floated the idea of easing at least some restrictions as early as May 1. Some observers believe restrictions could be eased first in places where the spread is low, if rigorous testing and contact tracing could prevent a sudden explosion in infections. But Schuchat warned that \"there is no way the entire country could relax mitigation on May 1 and the country not experience a major resurgence.\ "
  The first health-care worker at a Quebec long-term care home to test positive for COVID-19 had, like thousands of other Quebecers, recently returned from a trip abroad during the province's early March break.   Her case was reported March 14 by the health board for the Lanaudière region, just northeast of Montreal. In retrospect, it was a warning of how easily the coronavirus could enter seniors' residential institutions, known in the province as CHSLDs. One day before, in what had seemed like an harsh measure to some, Premier François Legault had banned visits to all seniors' homes when he declared a public health emergency.   It was already too late. Outbreaks were reported at a number of residences in the following days. On March 18, Mariette Tremblay, 82, a resident of a private seniors' home in the same Lanaudière region, died of COVID-19 and became Quebec's first known victim of the pandemic.  She had had a visit from a family member back from a trip. Infection spread through a Sherbrooke seniors' home, too, after a family reunion. Vectors of the coronavirus — family and health-care staff returning from abroad — had entered the CHSLDs, home to the province's most vulnerable to the disease, long before Legault called for an end to visits. But a failure to respond quickly and effectively in the weeks since has allowed COVID-19 to spread almost unhindered in dozens of homes, according to interviews with health-care workers, union representatives and a review of documents that demonstrate a lack of clear directives.   Workers on the front lines describe chaos inside the homes as increasing numbers of staff and residents fell sick, including a lack of protective equipment for themselves and residents who had not yet caught the disease. They also say whatever measures were in place to prevent spread of the virus weren't fully respected. Some workers who tested positive say they were ordered to return work before the end of their quarantine. Now residents of those homes account for the vast majority of the COVID-19 death toll in Quebec. Of the 1,340 dead tallied so far in Quebec, 1,057 were seniors in care. The crisis is far from over.  More than 80 homes considered \"critical\" by the province, a number that has doubled in the past week.   At least 4,000 health-care workers have tested positive for COVID-19 and another 5,500 are absent from work, making it difficult for many CHSLDs to provide the most basic care.   One emergency room doctor at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital has described how patients are being wheeled into the ER, not sick from COVID-19, but because they are dehydrated and malnourished. Slow to adapt after focus on hospitals When a woman who had been travelling in Iran was reported to be the first case in the province Feb. 28, the province said the threat was still minimal — and the focus was on preparing hospitals. \"All the measures that are necessary to protect the population, to protect the workers and take care of the patients, if it occurs, are there,\" Danielle McCann, the provincial health minister, said at the time. But as it became clear the bigger threat was in long-term care homes and other kinds of seniors' residences, the province was critcized for being slow to reallocate resources and staff. Alain Croteau, a union president representing workers at the Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal health agency, described the response as \"very chaotic, very disorganized.\ " By March 30, two weeks after the ban on visits to hospitals and seniors' homes, the province announced the number of cases had surpassed 3,000.   At Quebec nursing home, orderlies worked without PPE, COVID-19 patients wandered halls That day, it announced $133 million in emergency funding for CHSLDs and other kinds of seniors' establishments. \"We will be able to hire more staff, buy more protective equipment and more disinfectant,\" said Quebec's minister for seniors, Marguerite Blais.   In the weeks that followed, however, it became clear many residences were still operating without enough gloves, masks or gowns. Workers in Laurentians bought their own, for instance. So did nurses in Laval, fundraising with colleagues on social media and buying N95 masks and Bauer visors from friends of friends. Directives published March 25 by Laval's health board stated staff in CHSLDs don't have to wear N95s, even when treating COVID-positive patients, unless the patients are on oxygen machines. \"The reason for that remains nebulous to me,\" said Jessika Côté, an emergency room nurse in Laval. She was reassigned to work at a hard-hit seniors' residence, CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée, where at least 74 patients have died and more than 90 per cent of residents have tested positive.   A health-care worker is seen in the window of the CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée in Laval. Some workers have alleged they were forced to keep working at the short-staffed residence despite being symptomatic. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Mixed messages Even before the pandemic, CHSLDs across the province struggled to recruit enough nurses and patient attendants to provide quality care. Recognizing that poor pay could trigger absenteeism and make a chronic staffing shortage even worse, on April 1, the Quebec government boosted wages by eight per cent in public CHSLDs, and by $4 an hour in private long-term care homes.   But as conditions grew worse and more and more health-care workers started getting sick, workers who had tested positive for COVID-19 were ordered to return to CHSLDs before the end of a normally compulsory 14-day quarantine. THE DOSEHow to help seniors get through the COVID-19 pandemic At CHSLD Laflèche, a long-term care home in Shawinigan, for instance, workers who had been exposed to COVID-19 were told to leave isolation early because there was no staff to replace them. In early April, McCann defended the decision, saying it was \"exceptional\" and based on \"scientific advice\" provided by Quebec's public health institute. \"Leaving people all by themselves without services — we cannot do that,\" she said. The government still has not banned outright the practice of health-care workers putting in shifts at more than one nursing home, despite warnings from workers of the increased risk of spreading the virus. Côté, the ER nurse, believes there would be thousands fewer health-care workers absent or sick today if the province had provided workers with the right equipment and clearer directives. Jessika Côté, usually an emergency room nurse at Cité-de-la-Santé, the main hospital in Laval, was reassigned to CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée, where at least 69 residents have died since the pandemic began. (Submitted by Jessika Côté) When she arrived at CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée on April 3, Côté said managers didn't even know she was coming and didn't give her any training.   She was sent to one of the home's hot zones, where she scrambled to provide residents a minimum of care. Côté says the CHSLD only provided a surgical face mask, a gown and a pair of gloves.   In the days that followed, she observed staff circulating between cold and hot zones without changing gowns — a major potential vector for the virus, she said.   Instead of changing gloves, many would simply wash or sanitize them, she said. Côté said the circumstances only got worse in the days that followed — a heavier workload, more deaths, and COVID-positive patients being transferred back into areas where some hadn't yet caught the disease. \"They said that since most of the CHSLD was contaminated anyway, there was no point having designated zones,\ " Côté said. Côté said she and her colleagues cried every day.    \"The co-ordinator would go from nurse to nurse, and we would all be in tears because we just couldn't anymore,\ " she said.     Of the 25 ER nurses who were sent to work in Laval CHSLDs, Côté said, nine have since caught the coronavirus. Côté is one of them. As awful as COVID-19 can be, Côté said, it was a relief when she received her positive result over a week ago.   \"I love my work, so I don't like saying this, but it finally gave me a break,\" she said. In a few days, she'll be going back to Sainte-Dorothée, where she's heard things are a little better. Offers of help, unheeded In recent weeks, as the crisis has become even more acute, Legault has repeatedly called on health-care workers to help staff the besieged nursing homes. But many say they put their names forward early in the pandemic but weren't able to secure a position, with the hiring bureaucracy overwhelmed. Natalie Stake-Doucet, the president of Quebec's nurses association, said she tried for weeks to offer her assistance at a CHSLD.   \"It took, finally, talking directly to someone who I know who happens to be a manager and got me a job,\ " she said. \"When I got there, it was devastation. I've never seen anything like it. It was shocking and sad and overwhelming,\" she said. Quebec Premier François Legault said Friday that the 'big lesson' he's learned in this pandemic is that long-term care homes need more staff and more space. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press) Stake-Doucet, now a PhD candidate and nursing instructor at the Université de Montréal, stopped working full-time as a nurse two years ago, in part out of frustration over the impact of cuts to the health-care network on patient care. She blames health reforms imposed by the previous Liberal government on the breakdown in communication between health authorities and health-care workers on the front lines. She said the chronic staff shortages in the CHSLDs prior to the crisis have made the problem even worse. In his daily briefings, Legault has said repeatedly that the time will come to examine all that went wrong.  In a strikingly frank mea culpa a week ago, the premier said he takes \"full responsibility\" and is filled with remorse that \"we didn't better care for the elderly, the most vulnerable.\" Legault says he should have raised wages of long-term care workers long ago On Friday, he said he is \"not excluding\" the possibility of taking over all private seniors' homes and creating a network of more spacious, better-staffed and more home-like residences for the aged across the province.   He said he'd learned \"a big lesson\" about the need for less crowding and more staff. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Quebec's long-term care institutions, Legault said, has been like setting fire to hay.   \"Everything burns rapidly,\" he said. 
  The tiny asparagus spears poking out of the soil did not survive the night. It was too cold. Yet, it is a sign that harvest time is getting closer.   However, many Canadian farmers are worried that a delay in the arrival of temporary foreign workers because of COVID-19 could result in decreased production, possible food shortages and, in turn, increased prices.   \"On a good day we can harvest 20,000 pounds of asparagus,\" says John Jaques of Sunshine Asparagus Farms in Thamesville, Ont.   \"If we don't have labour and if we aren't capable of getting it out of the field and getting it packed, you know, that could be $40,000 worth of product there.\" Asparagus is one the first fresh vegetables harvested in Ontario every spring. Jaques, like thousands of other farmers across Canada, relies on temporary foreign workers. He has been hiring workers to help with the harvest for the past 20 years. He was expecting 30 workers to arrive by April 24 from Mexico, ready for harvest the first week of May. Now he is not sure when they will all arrive.   \"We need all hands on deck to get it out of the field,\ " says Jaques, whose farm has been in the family since 1850. On John Jaques' farm in Thamesville, Ont., the first asparagus spears of the season have started poking out of the ground in recent days.   (CBC) Every year,  the Canadian agricultural industry employs about 60,000 temporary foreign workers. When Canada closed its border on March 21 to non-essential travel, it initially included these workers. They have since been granted an exemption due to the labour-intensive nature of Canada's agriculture industry, but even so, it's unclear how many will come this season. Jaques is hoping some of the workers he employs will arrive at his farm next week. But flight schedules to Canada have been erratic, and once workers do arrive in the country they must be quarantined for 14 days. All these factors could delay his harvest further.   \"One of the things that COVID is doing is it's revealing to us a bunch of areas where our food system is vulnerable, and one of those areas is labour,\" says Evan Fraser, director of the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph.   \"I think it's going to [create] a whole bunch of disruptions. The fact that we aren't able to get labour in the sort of seamless or frictionless way as we're used to means that planting will be delayed, and that things like pruning apple orchards won't happen with the same level of efficiency.\" Charles Keddy employs temporary foreign workers on his strawberry farm in Nova Scotia, but concerns around COVID-19 are causing labour shortages. (CBC) It's not just farmers who are dealing with COVID-19-related uncertainty. Del-Leon Walker arrived in Nova Scotia from Jamaica earlier this week to work on Charles Keddy's strawberry farm for his 14th season. He says it was hard to leave his wife and two children at an unpredictable time. Farmers concerned about disruptions to spring seeding, livestock operations amid COVID-19Under quarantine to help contain COVID-19, migrant farm workers have fears of their own \"They were feeling sad, but I sat with them and we talked about it, and they understand what we are going through and it's a pandemic, it's all around. It's here and it's in Jamaica,\" says Walker. \"So we just have to do what we have to do and just be safe.\ " Del-Leon Walker travelled to Nova Scotia from Jamaica for his 14th season working on Keddy's farm. (CBC) Walker says he also knows of someone who decided not to come to Canada to work on the harvest this year for fear of contracting the virus.   \"We understand that there are a lot more cases here, but we still made the decision to be here …. This is work, and without work we will not survive.\ " $50M fund looks to help defray costs of quarantine for temporary foreign workersAdvocacy group says undocumented migrants need access to government benefits He is currently in quarantine in his own room on-site at the farm. Walker is being paid for his time in quarantine, but is anxious to get to work.   \"We understand this is a serious time,\" he says. \"And we are happy with the work we have done over the years.\ " Back in Ontario, Jaques is renovating the bunkhouses for the workers in order to accommodate for physical distancing. He's also retro-fitting farm equipment so they don't sit so close together on harvest aids, as well as purchasing more to make up the shortfall. Jaques rides an asparagus harvest aid. Five workers would usually sit side by side as the machine moves through the fields, but the physical-distancing requirements to stop the spread of COVID-19 mean only three will be able to ride each machine.   (CBC) \"Some farmers are saying I don't have the bunkhouses to house my workers, so I'm only bringing in half as much, we're only going to pick half our crop. So there will be [production issues] , I think that supplies will be tight.\ " At his on-site processing facility, where asparagus is bundled as well as pickled and put in jars, fewer workers will be able to work the line in order to accommodate physical distancing, further slowing production. All of which increases Jaques' costs, and may cut into production. And that could mean higher prices at the checkout aisle.   \"I hope the prices are higher, because in order to cover the extra costs I think we need to have a higher price. But we'll see what happens … I don't make those decisions,\" says Jaques.   Jaques holds a jar of his farm's asparagus.   (CBC) Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a program offering $1,500 per temporary foreign worker to each farmer to help recoup things like extra housing and equipment costs. But that does nothing to offset the delay in getting people to start work.   \"Our system is really struggling right now to figure out what to do in the absence of this labour or having this labour come in at a much smaller, slower rate,\" says Fraser. \"Perhaps some items that we used to get from Ontario farms may not be as plentiful this year, and they may be more expensive.\ "  But Fraser also says consumers should not worry.   \"I'm seeing heroic, Herculean efforts by our farmers, our food processors and by government to try to keep the system moving along as effectively as possible.\" The issues with migrant workers could also be an opportunity for Canadians looking for work. An Instagram account @HelpCanadaGrow and a Facebook page were  launched last week to connect local people with farmers to help fill the labour gap.   Canadian farmers are saying the lack of temporary foreign workers due to COVID-19 is putting a strain on food supply. 2:30 Quebec, expecting a shortfall of 3,000 workers, has also announced a program to recruit 8,500 Quebec workers for the agricultural sector.   As spring planting approaches, Quebec farmers face steep costs, long delays in getting foreign workersB.C. farmers adjust to new government rules for temporary foreign workers Jaques has started looking at training local help to fill the gap at his farm, and some nearby families have also offered to help out in those crucial first few weeks of harvest. But he still expects a tough season ahead.   \"It's still a long road ahead. I think it's going to be a challenge training new workers.\ " He also hopes for a few more cold nights to delay harvest until his workforce is ready. \"I'm sure Mother Nature will co-operate. She always does.\"

  Speeding drivers whipping past photo radar machines outside Toronto schools or near seniors' areas will not be automatically ticketed during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The city is delaying its plans to start ticketing this April, even though 50 machines have been in place for months, because the processing of those tickets has been deemed \"non-essential,\" a city spokesperson confirmed in an email. Further, CBC Toronto has also confirmed that Toronto police temporarily shut down its Vision Zero enforcement team for weeks amid the pandemic due to its own safety concerns about the novel coronavirus. The team of eight officers is now back at work from Monday to Saturday. Why does this matter? Overall traffic levels have dropped significantly across the city and there hasn't been a pedestrian fatality on public roads in over a month. However, police are reporting speeding and stunt driving are up, creating potentially deadly situations for vulnerable road users. \"People are heading to essential workplaces. People are picking up groceries and medication. Families and children are outside getting exercise. These are the people that speeding drivers are endangering,\" said Cycle Toronto's Kevin Rupasinghe. \"We should not wait for bodies to pile up. We know this is a problem and we have the tools and resources to address it, so let's act.\ " Rupasinghe added any additional traffic-related injuries at this time will strain a health-care system that's focused on dealing with COVID-19 patients.   City says it can't process tickets Cycle Toronto is calling for the province to act swiftly and change photo radar regulations so the machines can be redeployed to streets where speeding is an issue. Current regulations state photo radar can only be used in community safety zones, and there are rules around signage and warning periods, as well. However, even if the machines were operating, there's nobody to process the tickets, as what the city calls a joint-processing centre has been shuttered.   Traffic is down, but speeding is up on Toronto's roads, police say. (Michael Wilson/CBC) \"Provincial Offence Act Courtrooms are closed until May 29 and the limitation periods have been suspended, meaning there is no longer the legal requirement to issue Offence notices within 23 days of the date of the offence or file with court within seven days of the issuance of an offence notice,\" said Jasmine Patrick in an email.   \"Additionally, Toronto Courts have indicated their filing locations are closed until further notice and that they can only accept tickets filed electronically.\" Police in middle of speeding ticket blitz Without photo radar, Toronto's vulnerable road users are once again counting on police to stop dangerous drivers. Traffic Services Supt. Scott Baptist, who confirmed the Vision Zero enforcement unit stopped its work from March 23 to April 6,  warned drivers that police are still watching the roads, and are currently in the second week of an enforcement blitz targeting speeding. \"There are frontline uniform police officers on patrol 24-7 across the city and all of them enforce traffic laws,\"  he said in an email.   Toronto police charge driver, 21, who allegedly did doughnuts at Yonge and DundasCash grab or necessity? Ontarians sound off on photo radar However, Mayor John Tory has said there's a clear need for photo radar. \"We need automated speed enforcement to get people to slow down,\ " he said last November, before threatening drivers with a \"pretty big fat ticket\" for speeding. \"We've changed the speed limits, but in order to then make that really work, you have to enforce those laws and we just can't afford to have a police officer on every corner.\" Don Peat, the mayor's spokesperson, said Tory is aware of the delay and \"has made it clear to City staff that he wants automated speed enforcement tickets to be issued as soon as possible.\" City officials couldn't provide an update on when that will happen.  
 \"Test, test, test.\ " That's the first rule in the war against COVID-19, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). \"You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,\ " Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, said in a briefing on Monday. But right now, Canada does not know who is infected. Or how many people are infected. And some Canadians might never know if they had COVID-19. That's because not everyone can get a test, even if they have symptoms and think they might have the illness. Access to testing varies across the country. In Ontario, tests are being rationed so that there will be enough for the highest priority patients, including health-care workers. \"The extremely high volume of COVID-19 tests being conducted at the Public Health Ontario Laboratory requires us to start prioritizing testing for the most vulnerable people in our health system and those who treat patients,\" a Public Health Ontario spokesperson told CBC News via email. \"In terms of who should not be tested, people who do not have symptoms do not require testing.\" So far, nearly 66,000 Canadians have been tested, including about 17,000 in B.C., 16,650 in Ontario and 14,500 in Alberta. About 873 Canadians have tested positive, and 12 deaths have been reported. At Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital, a new guidance document describes the latest testing protocol. Anyone who is asymptomatic will be sent home without a test and be instructed to self-isolate and monitor themselves for common cold symptoms. Even people who have mild symptoms will not be tested unless they work in a high-risk setting such as a hospital or a long-term care facility. A health-care worker speaks to another staff member portraying the role of a patient during preparations for the opening of the COVID-19 assessment centre at Brewer Park Arena in Ottawa last Friday. Doctors don't necessarily need to know whether a person is infected with the virus to begin treatment for COVID-19. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) At Toronto's Humber River Hospital, emergency physician Dr. Tasleem Nimjee said the \"at risk\" list includes paramedics, hospital staff, and people working in prisons. \"These are groups that we would certainly want to test because we worry about the risk, if they do have the infection, of infecting large numbers of people.\" Supply shortages So, why are tests being rationed? One major problem is a shortage of laboratory supplies. For days, doctors in hospitals across Canada have watched anxiously as they run low on supplies of nasal swabs needed to test patients. The Public Health Agency of Canada put out an urgent call to university research groups asking them to donate testing chemicals, called reagents, along with other products needed to do virus testing. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territoryWho gets called back? Montrealer's experience highlights confusion over COVID-19 test results At the same time, Health Canada issued an interim order  to speed up the importation of COVID-19 viral detection kits.   Dr. Allison McGeer at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital said the lack of trained staff could become another strain on the system. \"The entire supply chain is fragile in this situation, and both enough [testing] machines and enough staff are problems,\ " she told CBC News in an email. In Ontario, people are waiting up to five days to learn whether they tested positive for COVID-19. It's a situation Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott called \"unacceptable\" at a briefing yesterday. A nurse wearing protective gear takes a swab from a passenger who arrived from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh during a COVID-19 test at the Minsk National Airport in Belarus. (Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters) Alberta increased its capacity to more than 2,000 tests per day, but the province's chief medical officer said they can't keep going at that level. \"These are not numbers that the labs can necessarily sustain in the long term,\ " Dr. Deena Hinshaw said during a briefing on Thursday. \"We do not have a capacity, and we will not have the capacity in the short or medium term to test every Albertan who has a cough or a runny nose.\" Testing key to containment Politicians, public health officials and researchers agree that testing rates must increase, because there are fears Canada might be missing hundreds of cases. \"I think it's pretty clear from what we've seen in Europe that we need to ramp up and we need to be thinking outside of the normal box and doing whatever we can to increase capacity,\" said Jim Woodgett, director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. Testing is not a luxury, WHO officials stress. Rather, it is the key to containing the spread of the virus. Only by knowing who is infected can public health officials stop the chain of infection. What to do if you're home sick with COVID-19 It's believed that many people who are infected experience almost no symptoms. Those people need to know that they are contagious and take action to self-isolate. Widespread population testing in South Korea is credited for containing that country's outbreak. Testing is also the only way to get an accurate picture of the pandemic and determine the true fatality rate. Right now, the death rate is a percentage of all of the known cases and ranges from about 0.28 to 10 per cent depending on the country. But that number would drop dramatically if it could be proven that there are many more infections that are not being counted right now because people have not become sick enough to go to a doctor. University research labs are ready to help Woodgett said university and hospital research laboratories in Canada are standing by ready to help with testing. \"We're in unusual and critical times where we should be looking at how best to safely expand testing using the expertise which is in the research laboratories,\" he said. \"The research hospitals in most of our major cities have this tremendous capability. The universities also.\" A nurse holds a nose swab after administering it on a patient at a drive-in testing site at the Regional Hospital Centre in Liege, Belgium. Testing for the virus isn't hard, but 'you have to have tremendous quality control,' says Jim Woodgett, director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. (Francois Lenoir/Reuters) Although Canada's research labs have the necessary testing equipment, there are quality control issues that have to be worked out. \"This is not a difficult test at all,\" said Woodgett. \"However, what's key here is that you have to have tremendous quality control because you don't want to get the result wrong.\" As officials grapple with the obstacles to increased testing, social isolation remains the primary method of controlling viral spread. It's the default instruction for anyone who has returned from travel, or anyone who has symptoms. Test not needed for treatment The fact is, doctors don't need to know whether a person is infected to begin taking care of them. That's because there are no drugs or specific therapies that are available to treat the disease. Watch:  Why some sick Canadians aren't getting tested for the coronavirus   A look at why the health-care system is rationing coronavirus tests. 1:56 \"At this point, testing isn't particularly clinically informative because what physicians are doing mostly is just trying to stabilize those patients by treating their symptoms, not by treating the virus directly,\" said Matthew Miller, an infectious disease researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton. Got questions about physical distancing? Here's what you need to know That means doctors are only able to offer supportive care for patients who are seriously ill, including providing ventilator breathing assistance if they become critically ill. People with mild illness will be sent home to recover, Miller said. \"The majority of people who experience mild symptoms, they need to stay at home whether they have coronavirus or whether there's a possibility they have something else.\ "
     Parliament passes $107 billion COVID-19 aid package. Federal government streamlines, expands COVID-19 benefits program. Mandatory isolation orders for international travellers to kick in at midnight, health minister says. Recommendations for what kind of exercise is allowed while still practising social distancing. Read more: Here's the latest on what's happening in Canada and around the world.   A man does push-ups near a closed park in Vancouver. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Federal government streamlines, expands COVID-19 benefits program Access to and eligibility for the federal government's COVID-19 emergency benefits have been the subject of numerous emails from Coronavirus Brief readers. Today, Ottawa announced that it has streamlined the program and said Canadians who are struggling financially can now expect payments within weeks. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) collapses the two previously announced benefits into one as the government struggles to cope with an unprecedented volume of employment insurance (EI) claims. CERB offers income support for up to 16 weeks to those who lose pay because of the pandemic. A government news release said the \"simpler and more accessible\" program will cover Canadians who lost their jobs, got sick, are under quarantine or have to stay home because of school closures. It's available to wage earners, contract workers and self-employed people who don't qualify for EI. Dozens of Canadian business groups, meanwhile, are calling on governments to make a \"national effort\" to protect jobs and keep essential goods moving during the COVID-19 crisis — one that would include direct income supports for laid-off employees. Read more   Mandatory isolation orders for international travellers kick in at midnight, health minister says All travellers returning to Canada — with the exception of what the federal government calls \"essential workers\" — will have to enter a mandatory 14-day quarantine as of midnight, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. Starting Thursday morning, Canada Border Services Agency officers will inform all returning Canadians and permanent residents of the new orders to begin isolation at home, and tell them that they are forbidden from stopping along the way. The minister said officials will begin taking down contact information at the border to follow up with returning travellers and will be enforcing random inspections. Hajdu told the Senate that individuals who exhibit symptoms will be banned from taking public transit to their places of isolation — but later clarified that all returning travellers will be forbidden from taking city buses, trains and subways. Read more   In this time of social distancing, what is permitted in terms of going outside and getting some exercise? Under social distancing guidelines, you can go out for groceries and other necessities — and you may also go out for some exercise. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toronto, said going for a jog with one other person is OK as long as you keep a two-metre distance from each other. What about team sports? \"Playing soccer, basketball or other team sports with friends is not social distancing,\" said Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health. She added that exercise doesn't necessarily require leaving your home. What if you don't want to go outside? \"Staying home can still mean staying active,\ " de Villa said. \"You can try free live-streamed online fitness classes, or apps to guide your in-home workout.\" (An important note: These recommendations apply to people who are symptom-free, have not recently travelled internationally, have not been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are practising social distancing.) Read more  ANALYSIS Why Canada's COVID-19 response could be derailed by a swab on a stick Shortages of testing swabs and laboratory chemicals, along with a bottleneck at provincial laboratories, means Canada has not been able to ramp up its capacity to test Canadians for COVID-19. \"Everything is a choke point. If it wasn't yesterday, it will be today or tomorrow.\" said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease researcher at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. Most hospitals keep a short-term supply of swabs, which works in normal, non-pandemic situations. But now, Canada is competing with the rest of the world to buy everything from swabs to masks to testing kits — including the U.S., where many of these products are made. \"The supply chain for the clinical labs for actual tests is getting to be very constrained, to the point where we're probably literally days away from running out of key components,\" said Jim Woodgett, director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Currently, most provincial labs are running at full capacity, with each PCR machine able to do about 96 tests every three to four hours. That's not fast enough, writes CBC science correspondent Kelly Crowe. THE SCIENCE More than half of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada now caused by community spread More than half of Canada's COVID-19 cases are caused by spread in the community from an unknown source, and experts say that signals there could be a silent epidemic happening across the country. Of the 1,352 cases that the Public Health Agency of Canada has provided epidemiological data on as of yesterday, 53 per cent are a result of infection from community transmission, while 44 per cent are tied to travellers and people who came into close contact with a traveller who tested positive. Community transmission is the spread of an illness with no known link to travel or previously confirmed cases, which suggests a growing number of cases are likely going unreported across the country. \"If a virus is now spreading in the community, what that means is that we don't have a really good ability to be able to monitor where that virus is, who it's going to and who that person has contacted,\" said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. AND FINALLY... Bringing hope to Regina, one heart at a time Some hearts in Regina windows have messages of love and support for people to see when they walk by.   (Submitted by Jaimie Bashutski) Heather Getz created a Facebook page called Hearts YQR with the goal of sharing images of hearts in windows around Regina. Getz said she was inspired by a woman in B.C. with a similar page and decided to start her own when she couldn't find one locally. \"Watching for hearts on people's houses makes you feel connected and it gives the kids something to watch for, too,\ " Getz said. \"I hope it helps them to feel connected, and then they're not all alone right now. Social isolation can be a tough thing for people.\ " In addition to hanging signs and hearts in windows, some children went out to tape up paper hearts around their street so people had something to find when walking around. \"There's still joy and there's still hope,\ " Getz said. \"I want people to remember to stay strong and to stay healthy and that even though we're physically apart that we are all together.\ " Read the full article   Send us your questions Still looking for more information on the outbreak?

  Cleaners are fogging parts of the inside of the Saskatoon Correctional Centre with an industrial disinfectant to try to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It's the latest step to stem the spread of the virus in a facility that now has five confirmed cases, all involving staff members. \"At the moment we're just doing the common areas, the gym area,\" said Dennis Slobogian with Skyview Cleaning. The disinfectant compound is branded Vital Oxide and is benign enough to humans that it can be applied without any personal protective gear, he said. \"It's a small machine that blows out a mist maybe two or three feet. You go up against the wall and you kind of wave it up and down, cover the whole area with it,\ " he said. \"It gets into the nooks and crannies and covers the whole surface.\" New offenders arriving at the men's jail also now undergo specific screening for COVID-19 by a nurse, says Noel Busse with the Ministry of Justice. Busse said social distancing is difficult to maintain in a jail, especially when inmates are bunked two to a cell or spend time in a common area like a gymnasium.  ' In for some scary times' as 2 COVID-19 cases linked to Saskatoon Correctional Centre, union says  The jail has suspended personal and professional visits by lawyers, friends and family of inmates. Even with these measures, officers at the Saskatoon jail are apprehensive because the facility has a confined population and confirmed cases, says Bob Bymoen with the Saskatchewan Government and General Employees' Union. \"One of the bigger concerns we hear from corrections officers is the lack of personal protective equipment. Not enough of it,\" he said. Staff do have access to gloves and masks. But Bymoen says it's not clear under what circumstances they should be used. He says it's also not clear whether it's an individual choice, or if someone orders it. \"That's all changing really fast,\ " he said. Busse said personal protective equipment is available to all correctional facility employees based on the level of risk associated with their duties, as recommended by public health authorities and occupational health and safety. Busse says the government won't comment on whether the jail staff who tested positive were located in administrative offices or in a particular unit. It also will not comment on whether the three new cases this week came from staff travelling, or whether the virus was picked up through community transmission. The province does not believe the virus has spread into the jail's general population. \"We have no reason to believe these cases were spread within the correctional facility,\" Busse said. \"However, public health's investigation is still ongoing.\" Bymoen said he wouldn't speculate on whether he believes the virus has been transmitted from staff to the general population. 
  A manufacturer of medical ventilators says Canada should have stockpiled the machines after Toronto's 2003 SARS outbreak, given they are now harder to come by as hospitals around the world scramble to buy more with the outbreak of COVID-19. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines that help patients with damaged lungs get enough oxygen to live. Since COVID-19 can harm the lungs, the devices are critical to the survival of people hit hard by the virus.   There are now five presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, and the provincial government has ordered 140 ventilators to boost the province's supply of about 240. But Eric Gjerde, CEO of Airon Corporation, a U.S. company that manufactures ventilators for sale in Canada and abroad, said those machines should have already been on hand. \"Your government and Ministry of Health should have hundreds of ventilators in storage,\" he said in an email.   \"These ventilators can sit in boxes for years, with no maintenance. When they are needed, you just attach oxygen and you are good. It is just frustrating that governments can't think ahead and be prepared!\" SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was caused by a coronavirus that spread through much of the world in the early 2000s, killing hundreds of people including 44 in Canada. Nova Scotia has ordered 140 ventilators as it prepares for an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. (Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP via Getty Images) It could be hard for companies to meet demand for ventilators as the need skyrockets worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. It typically takes three to four weeks to fill an order, according to Canadian supplier McArthur Medical Sales. But during the pandemic it is \"very difficult\" to estimate when machines will be available, said Frank Fiorenza, a product development manager at McArthur and a respiratory therapist at the Ottawa Hospital. Some European countries struggling with coronavirus, like Italy and Germany, are clamouring for more ventilators to treat severe cases of the illness. Italy, which as of Sunday had more 1,800 deaths due to coronavirus, recently issued a tender for an additional 5,000 ventilators. Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said ventilators are expensive and over time they become outdated and can't be used.    \"Just creating a big stockpile of ventilators thinking that whatever time in the future you might have them may not be the wisest thing,\ " he said Monday.     He said 11 years ago during H1N1 pandemic the province did increase the number of ventilators. Under normal circumstances those old machines would no longer be used, he said, but during the current outbreak they might be put into service in some fashion. Fiorenza said other provinces have similar caches of old machines. In Ontario, he said 16 hospitals have at least 216 ventilators that act as a pandemic reserve. However, he said health authorities need to make sure they have enough respiratory therapists to run them. \"If nobody knows how to use them, if nobody knows how to run them  it's irrelevant. You're not going to be really saving lives if people are on machines and the operator doesn't know how to work it,\" said Fiorenza, who is in self-isolation at his home in Ottawa after returning from a family vacation in Jamaica.    Supply chain problem Right now, Airon has received large orders from U.S. emergency organizations, which has eaten up its production capacity for the next several months. As such, the company has stopped all international shipments, including those to Canada. It can make 20 ventilators a week.   \"The main problem is the supply chain. We do just-in-time manufacturing and have very lean component supplies in stock. That's the hard part, getting our custom parts made and delivered in an emergency,\ " said Gjerde. World Health Organization warned last week of global shortages and price gouging on ventilators and personal protective equipment, and urged companies and governments to increase production by 40 per cent. A survey in 2009 showed there were almost 5,000 mechanical ventilators spread out in 286 hospitals across Canada.   MORE TOP STORIES
  Canadian Broadway star Nick Cordero's recent leg amputation due to complications from COVID-19 is an example of a constellation of things that can go wrong during severe bodily infections, say doctors. The Hamilton-raised actor-singer's wife, personal trainer Amanda Kloots, said his right leg was amputated last weekend in Los Angeles after blood clotting issues arose while he was being treated for the coronavirus. Cordero was in a medically induced coma on various machines to support his heart, lungs and kidneys. While problems with organs and tissues can also unfold in other types of flu and critical illness, doctors say such cases highlight that COVID-19 can stretch far beyond a respiratory illness. As Montreal emergency physician Dr. Abdo Shabah explains, complications can arise beyond the typical flu and respiratory symptoms due to high levels of inflammation in the lungs, which can affect the level of oxygen in the blood and its delivery. That can put stress on the whole body and lead to issues with the heart, such as arrhythmia and unstable blood pressure, and infection in other organs including the kidneys and liver. \"The inflammation in the whole body triggered by this disease can affect the clotting path, and that is still under research,\" says Shabah, a board member at the Canadian Medical Association. \"It's very difficult to describe the clear mechanism, but we see that association with other organ failures, such as kidney failures or having other clotting factors.\ " Chinese doctors were first to sound the alarm about blood clots in COVID-19 patients. In March, Chinese heart specialists advised the American College of Cardiology to watch for clots and said certain blood tests showing a rise in clot risk might signal which patients were in greatest danger. Other reports suggested the clots can show up all over the body. But were they a cause of deterioration or an effect? And what role does treatment play in exacerbating some of the complications? Cordero was on a dialysis machine, a ventilator and an ECMO machine Patients with severe cases may need a ventilator to help the lungs, a dialysis machine to support the kidneys, and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to assist the heart and lungs. The 41-year-old Cordero was on all three at one point in his treatment. Like any medical intervention, such aggressive support devices can also pose a risk to a patient through infection, blood clots and other issues. But generally such machines are life-saving measures and their benefits far outweigh the risks associated with them, says Shabah. Clotting factors and organ failures are still \"minimal compared to the main general aspects of really severe pulmonary failure,\" says Shabah. \"So respiratory failure that happens is the main thing that worries us.\" Patients with severe cases may also require high doses of certain medications, such as inotropes or vasopressors, to support the heart and control blood pressure. \"What we see sometimes with high doses of vasopressure medications, is that it sort of robs some parts of the body from blood pressure in order to supply the core organs,\" says Dr. Rob Fowler of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. \"And so we see that maybe the skin, for instance, in the fingers and the toes will look like they have less blood supply and less oxygen there, because that's in part the way some of these medications will work.\" Patients over 65 are more at risk As with seasonal influenza, patients who are more at risk of having severe COVID-19 symptoms and complications are those who are over age 65, and those with underlying health conditions and chronic diseases, which range from heart disease and high blood pressure, to diabetes, cancer, obesity and lung disease. But Fowler says hospitals are seeing both \"the original presentation\" of COVID-19 infections and complications in greater numbers, which puts a bigger strain on the health-care system. \"A big thing with this whole outbreak is just the volume of patients that we will see is so much greater with COVID, because it's affecting a population around the world that's never seen it before, and so no one has any immunity to it,\" says Fowler. \"With all of these complications, there was the first issue about running out of ventilators. But then soon after that, people began to realize we might also run out of dialysis machines, because we're needing to use them in numbers in a short period of time that we're not used to doing.\" Medicine used to treat such cases is also running out. \"Medications to keep people comfortable, sedated when they're on breathing machines; medications to support blood pressure, for instance, are being used at a rate that exceeds the usual ability to supply many hospitals,\" adds Fowler, who works in a critical care unit. \"And we're seeing these almost-shortages or shortages on a daily basis because of this increase in global demand. And it's not just ventilators — it's all that goes along with supporting people.\" Shabah echoes Fowler's message that this is all putting stress on the health-care system, which requires synchronicity in order to function properly, including having enough trained staff and a good supply of materials . \"If we have all the majors in place , I think we could manage it very well,\ " Shabah says. \"And I hope as Canadians, we will be able to get all this set for the next wave.\ "
  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and with no end to the pandemic in sight, questions about life-saving ventilators abound. The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood. It's in those cases that a ventilator can make the difference between life or death. But what is a ventilator, exactly? How does it work, and how are COVID-19 cases different from other instances when a ventilator is used? CBC explains. What is a ventilator? In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe. Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful. Watch: Medical technicians stand beside a ventilator and explains how it works Hospitals are scrambling to secure more ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak. A respiratory therapist explains how they work. 2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape. \"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu. \"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen. How does a ventilator work? \"There will always be some kind of pressure and some kind of flow happening — inhalation and exhalation. The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out. A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient. The patient will be intubated, meaning a tube will be inserted beyond the vocal cords into the airway, or trachea, and sealed to ensure the air goes where it's supposed to. Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube. According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in. In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.   (CBC News) How are COVID-19 cases different from other times ventilators are used? Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working. According to Hsu, the way COVID-19 patients are treated is similar to another condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But Hsu said an ARDS patient has a stiffening of the lung, causing it to spring back more quickly, which isn't seen in COVID-19 patients. A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like. If we put in a breath it might take a little longer to get it out again before we can do the next breath,\ " she said. How long can someone stay on a ventilator? \"Longer is worse,\" said Hsu. \"But we also know with COVID, sooner is better. If we wait to put people on a ventilator, we might wait until it's too late.\ " She said B.C. hasn't seen many severe cases yet, and a lot of them are still on ventilators, but it seems to require between a day and two weeks to treat coronavirus cases. \"Some people are on long-term ventilators for their whole life,\" for example, some people who are quadriplegic, said Hsu. In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube. Tina Hsu is a respiratory therapist and education director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists. She works at Vancouver General Hospital with Thompson Rivers University respiratory therapist students. (BCSRT) What are the risks of using a ventilator? \"The lungs are very delicate,\ " she said. \"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure. Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed. Can anyone operate a ventilator? In North America, ventilators are nearly exclusively operated by RTs in larger hospitals. Europe and China don't use RTs, according to Hsu, but it's a job in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. She said in smaller hospitals, or at times when an RT isn't available, a physician could run a ventilator. In some long-term care facilities, nurses will operate them. Does B.C. have enough ventilators? In areas of the world that have already been hit very hard by the pandemic, the ventilator supply has been an issue. In British Columbia, health officials have done modelling to determine how the province's supply is expected to hold up. Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are currently 1,272 in the province, with more on order. In most health regions, officials expect there will be enough, even if B.C. suffers a severe outbreak on the level of Northern Italy. But B.C.'s Northern Health region, for example, could be undersupplied with the current stock.    Do you have more to add to this story?

  Health Minister Patty Hajdu says the federal government is undertaking a massive effort to expand testing capacity and secure medical equipment so that health-care providers have the supplies they need to handle the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The effort includes approving new testing methods and purchasing additional test kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment, such as masks and gowns. \"We've been working around the clock with provinces and territories to make sure that everyone has what they need to detect and interrupt the chain of transmission,\ " Hajdu told a news conference Wednesday. Hajdu signed an \"interim order\" that allows faster importation and sale of medical devices, including COVID-19 test kits, and approved two new diagnostic tests that should allow provinces to test for new cases more widely. The health minister's comments came after the World Health Organization's director general called on countries to increase their testing.   \"You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday. \"We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case.\" COVID-19 testing kits sit stacked at a screening clinic in Montreal. (Ivanoh Demers/CBC/Radio-Canada) Chief Public Health Officer Teresa Tam said that officials have tested more than 50,000 Canadians since the beginning of the outbreak and the federal government has over 800,000 swabs ready for use in test kits. \"Eight hundred thousand swabs goes some ways, but it doesn't mean we can stop,\" said Tam. \"We must keep getting more on an ongoing basis.\" Watch: Canada's health minister explains the global effort to combat COVID-19 Health Minister Patty Hajdu says Canada is trying to speed up access to urgently-needed medical supplies, treatments and a vaccine to combat COVID-19. 2:47 Frontline veterans of infectious disease medicine say Canada's sickest COVID-19 patients may face three tightly connected shortages as the infection spreads: of intensive care space, ventilators and healthy hospital staff. Thomas Piraino, a Toronto respiratory therapist who worked through the 2003 SARS epidemic, said in an interview Tuesday his primary concern is whether enough intensive care beds will be available. \"We'll need good use of space,\ " Piraino said, noting intensive care beds are often up to 85 or 90 per cent occupied even in the absence of a global pandemic. If the country reaches the point where tens of thousands of people are infected at one time, Piraino said, it could start to cause strain on the system. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 600 people in Canada had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Another key problem area could be access to ventilators and the equipment that goes with them, said Frank Fiorenza, a respiratory therapist at Ottawa General who is also the product development manager for McArthur Medical Sales, a supplier of medical equipment. The medical machines are used to help those hit hard by COVID-19 to keep breathing. He suggests the federal government should move swiftly to procure a special order for the mechanical breathing machines, based on the provinces' requests for additional gear. Industry 'retooling' to make critical medical equipment: health minister Hajdu said that ventilators and other medical equipment are being ordered by Ottawa.   \"We're working through Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the minister of Public Services and Procurement to put in large, large orders,\ " said Hajdu. \"We know that even though the provinces and territories have indicated what they think they might need, in fact, we may need more.\" Part of that effort is a call-out the government released last week on its Buy and Sell website, which handles procurement. It's asking companies to let it know if they could supply products like N95 masks and surgical masks, nitrile gloves, vinyl gloves, gowns and bottles of hand sanitizer. Hajdu said a number of companies have indicated they have the ability to \"re-tool\" to make products that may be needed in the future. Tam said that while there is no current shortage of ventilators federal officials are trying to prevent a shortage. Watch: Dr. Tam outlines what's being done to secure critical medical equipment Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam outlines what is being done to secure critical medical supplies and equipment during the COVID-19 crisis.    1:44 Tam added that there are enough supplies now to meet 75 per cent of the stated need for personal protective equipment. \"We're pulling all stops to locate any other supplies, suppliers, bulk purchasing and any other means,\" said Tam. Tam warned that the health care system needs to be prepared for a second wave of the virus, even if ongoing efforts at social distancing are successful. \"This virus is going to be with us for some time,\ " Tam said. \"Even if we flatten this wave, we need to keep going so that when the next winter comes along, hopefully we've learned an incredible amount in the next several months for us to prepare for any potential resurgence.\" Watch:  What to do if you're self-isolating at home for COVID-19 You might choose to self-isolate at home if you’ve been exposed, or think you’ve been exposed, to COVID-19.

  University of Guelph professor Keith Warriner may have found a way to re-use N95 masks by using a device that is normally used to clean fruits and vegetables without water. 5:15 Mark VanderVeen and his team at Beamsville, Ont's Clean Works were determined to work at all hours, even over Easter weekend, to get their sanitization equipment out to front-line workers. VanderVeen, the president and CEO of Clean Works, has been in constant communication with officials from the National Research Council and Health Canada the past two weeks to make sure that the Clean Flow Healthcare Mini would be approved to sanitize N95 masks. The Clean Flow uses technology originally developed to sanitize produce, but was approved by Health Canada last week to be sent to health-care facilities so they can start reusing the N95s, a critical piece of personal protection equipment for people who may be exposed to COVID-19. \"These guys at the NRC and Health Canada, they worked the past two weeks, I would say 24/7, with us to validate and ensure that the technology provides the health-care workers with the solutions that they need,\" said VanderVeen on Monday. \"It was quite an extensive walk that we did but, again, it was to get a solution out there to health care providers.\" The 2.4-metre long stainless steel device — modelled off of a barbecue but similar in looks to a tanning bed — can sanitize 800 masks in an hour. Clean Works will deliver its first units to hospital health networks across Canada, including Hamilton Health Sciences and the Nova Scotia Health Authority, sometime this week. Orders for the units have also been placed by Niagara Health Region, Toronto EMS and National Research Council in Ottawa. \"You can move it from boardroom to boardroom, if that's what's required, or from floor to floor in hospitals and institutions,\" said VanderVeen. \"It's not a big, bulky machine of any sort. It's very portable. That's the way that we designed it.\ " The Clean Flow is based on a waterless process developed by Prof. Keith Warriner, who studies food sciences at the University of Guelph. It combines ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide and ozone to make compounds that kill pathogens, including the novel coronavirus. Warriner had been approached in 2015 by Paul Moyer, owner of Moyer's Apple Products and co-founder of Clean Works, because he was worried about the listeria outbreak in candy apples at the time. Warriner had been investigating waterless cleaning systems since 2005, and with Moyer he focused on the problem of sanitizing candy apples without melting or damaging the caramel coating. When the federal and provincial governments put out a call to private businesses to help with the COVID-19 pandemic, Warriner was inspired. He and post-doctorate researcher Mahdiyeh Hasani modified the clean-flow process to handle masks instead of produce. \"It's ideal, isn't it?\" said Warriner. \"It's a gentle process. It's waterless , it's effective and it's very quick.\ " Warriner says that getting Health Canada's approval for a process like the Clean Flow could normally take months but given the urgent need for the device, it was pushed through. Testing didn't just focus on making sure it could eradicate COVID-19, but also that the masks wouldn't be damaged or deteriorate during the process. Clean Works used to produce one of the Clean Flow units per week, but is now stepping up its manufacturing process to pump out more to meet the demand. 
  When did Canada's coronavirus testing go off the rails? The first clues were evident back on Jan. 24, the day after Wuhan, China, was locked down. \"We're ready; we're prepared.\ " Those were the confident words from Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, in a news briefing that day. The province already had a \"specific and reliable\" coronavirus test that could deliver results in 24 hours. The public message was clear. We've got this. After all, Ontario had survived SARS. \"Folks, it will still be business as normal,\" said Peter Donnelly, head of Public Health Ontario, at the same briefing.   One of the testing machines at the Public Ontario Health lab that has been running at full capacity to test COVID-19 patient samples.   (Craig Chivers/CBC) Through the unforgiving lens of hindsight, they could not have been more wrong. It's now brutally clear that SARS was just a warm-up — that roughly as many Canadians would die in just the first few weeks of this pandemic than in the entire SARS outbreak. And a critical weapon in the battle, laboratory testing, became log-jammed in the opening days. Backlogs quickly mounted One week after the province closed schools and shops and prohibited large gatherings, many labs were overwhelmed. By the first weekend, Ontario had a backlog of more than 7,200 tests. B.C. also reported a backlog, as did Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba. Almost immediately, provinces began restricting who could be tested — limiting it to front-line health-care workers, people with severe symptoms and those who work with vulnerable groups. Over the past week, the backlogs have cleared, but restrictions on testing still remain in most parts of Canada. Laboratory personnel at Ontario's public health laboratory have been working long hours for weeks trying to keep up with the demand for COVID-19 testing.   (Craig Chivers/CBC) And the hard truth is that testing will continue to be limited, even in Ontario, which has just announced it will soon be able to test 19,000 people a day. \"Even when we're at 19,000 tests a day, we're not going to be able to test everybody, and that would be the same in every other jurisdiction,\" said Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario, the government agency responsible for provincial labs. Ontario solves problem, creates another Just as the backlog was cleared, a new and equally frustrating problem emerged.  Media reports on Tuesday revealed that Ontario's testing rate was dropping to just over 2,500 per day, but the province said it could run about 13,000. Why isn't Ontario testing more? The province created a new network of clinical labs in the middle of the pandemic — like building a bigger boat, mid-ocean, in a hurricane. The Ministry of Health had the accounting firm KPMG organize all the labs in the province that are capable of microbial testing. That includes 10 hospital networks, six public health labs and three private lab networks. Added up, they can do 13,000 tests per day, and expect to reach 19,000 in three weeks. But that extra capacity was created suddenly, which means there weren't enough patient samples waiting to be tested, because there are still testing restrictions in place. An expert committee is working on new recommendations on who should be tested and Premier Doug Ford is calling for expanded testing in long-term care homes and for other vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, frightened patients such as Nick Marceau of Toronto can't get tested, even though his doctor suspects he has COVID-19. Dr. Kevin Katz is the medical director for laboratory testing in six Toronto hospitals. Katz began stockpiling COVID-19 testing supplies in early February, preparing for the worst.   (North York General Hospital) \"It's frustrating to … somebody who lives alone when when you're confronted with this,\ " Marceau, 38, said. Marceau doesn't qualify for a test because he hasn't travelled, isn't in a high-risk group and his symptoms aren't severe enough to send him to hospital. \"It was judged that it was a watch-and-wait situation,\ " he said.   'Completely unparalleled' Why is testing such a big problem? The simple answer — the COVID-19 tsunami caught almost everybody off guard. \"Everybody in the world is ramping up for the same tests, and they're all vying for the same reagents,\" said Allen, referring to the chemicals necessary to perform the tests. \"This is not an Ontario issue; this is an international issue. \"The demand for this test is completely unparalleled.\" The low rate is frustrating epidemiologists who are trying to create models of the disease, which politicians are using to support their decisions. (Nova Scotia Health Authority) Two months ago, Dr. Kevin Katz had an uneasy feeling about what might be headed his way. He is an infectious disease specialist who manages the testing laboratories for several Toronto hospitals, including North York General, Sunnybrook and Michael Garron. \"As soon as I thought this was going in the direction of a pandemic, I had concerns about the supply chain,\ " he said. The foreboding was based on more than a decade of pandemic planning. In the first week of February, he began quietly stocking up on reagents. Weeks later, he ordered more, plus materials needed to extract the virus's genetic material and additional testing equipment. \"We were pretty aggressive. We were ordering and asking to take delivery the next day. We wanted it all physically delivered so we have pallets sort of strewn around the lab,\ " he said.   A COVID-19 glossary: What the terms mean and some subtle differencesINTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   One consequence of the low level of testing across Canada is that no one has a clear idea how big the epidemic is in this country. \"Right now, we are almost certainly just seeing the most serious cases\" said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist with the University of Toronto. The low rate is frustrating Tuite and other epidemiologists who are trying to create models of the disease, which politicians are using to support their decisions. Ideally, with enough capacity, there would be no restrictions on testing, said Tuite. Right now, the reliability of the models is affected by the under-reporting of cases. \"Until we have a consistent amount of testing in the population, I think it's hard for me to say that I have confidence in those projections,\" said Tuite. 
  Many transit riders across B.C. are taking precautions to avoid coronavirus while on buses and trains as operators step up cleaning and disinfection. In Metro Vancouver, Ummun Nasser says she uses public transit each day to go to work and run errands like picking up groceries. Since coronavirus began appearing in the region, she has started wearing gloves, covering her mouth and keeping some distance from other passengers. She says she's not worried about being on transit during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the appearance of others either not being as calm or taking the same precautions.   Stay informed by joining our CBC Vancouver Facebook group on coronavirus   \"People are panicked about it but I'm not panicked,\ " she said. \"I'm trying to take the precautions.\" Anjel Chen lives in Vancouver and has to rely on transit for getting around.  She says she's heard people online say they are wearing gloves and masks as a precaution.   \"I wish that there was a more official announcement from the government or from health officials about taking public transit and more advice on that because it impacts everyone.\ " Here's what TransLink passengers are saying about coronavirus hygiene : Transit riders in Metro Vancouver talk about keeping themselves virus free. 1:00  TransLink says there are around 40 million boardings of its buses, trains or SeaBuses each month in the region. It has been doing increased cleaning to reduce or limit the virus on surfaces. Ben Murphy, a spokesperson for the authority, says it is taking advice from health officials, \"making sure we are cleaning the system to a really high standard.\" Stations and bus loops across the network are being cleaned at least once a day. That includes using disinfectant to wipe down stair and escalator handrails, elevator buttons, door handles, fare gates, Compass vending machines, garbage handles, benches, seats, emergency cabinets and emergency phones. All SkyTrain cars are cleaned overnight and receive a disinfectant wipe down of poles, seats, ceilings, handles, windows, sills, and other internal surfaces. The entire bus and SeaBus fleet is sprayed with \"a strong disinfectant each week,\" according to the authority. HandyDART vehicles are being cleaned and disinfected every day and all West Coast Express cars are cleaned and disinfected each evening. How contagious is public transit? Currently there have been no reports of anyone with coronavirus in B.C. using public transit. Jason Tetro, a visiting scientist at the University of Guelph who studies pathogens like the coronavirus, says public transit is the kind of place where a single person with the infection could spread it to many others. \"When you get people huddled together for some reason, then there's a good likelihood that there is going to be spread,\ " he said. Tetro says that the enhanced cleaning measures TransLink has implemented should help reduce the chance of any possible exposure. He recommends people use hand sanitizer once they disembark to kill any pathogen they may have touched. Meantime, TransLink is reiterating guidelines from the Canadian Public Health Agency. Those include not going on transit if you are sick, washing your hands often, not touching your face and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or your sleeve.

  The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation has purchased two mobile dialysis machines for the Charlottetown hospital, and will figure out where the money will come from later. \"We committed to that immediately,\" said foundation CEO Tracey Comeau. \"Typically we would raise the money first and then commit to purchase the machinery. But it happened another way around this time. And of course during crises nothing is the same.\" The hospital needs the machines for the intensive care unit it is setting up specifically for COVID-19 patients. It anticipates about five per cent of patients in that ICU will require dialysis. The hospital's current machines cannot be moved into the new ICU, and the patients will not be able to be moved. Fundraising challenges Comeau said the foundation has launched a special appeal and has already raised almost half of the $35,000 required. Most of the money raised so far came in the form of a single donation from the Island's Chinese community. Chinese community steps up with COVID-19 fundraising effort for P.E.I. health-care system This is a challenging time for fundraising for all charities, as special events that would attract attention to causes have been cancelled. The QEH Foundation is no exception.   \"The brunches that are held for us, the ceilidhs that support the QEH EastLink Telethon, the Women's Institute gala was for us this year. We're talking tens of thousands of dollars,\" said Comeau. It will not be possible to hold the telethon in its regular form this year, but Comeau is hopeful that some kind of event can be put together. In the meantime, she said, online donations are easy, and the foundation is having some success with them. COVID-19: What you need to know What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

  We're breaking down what you need to know about the pandemic by answering your questions. Send yours to covid@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We're publishing a selection of answers every weekday online, and putting some of your questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network.    We've received thousands of emails from all corners of the country. Your questions cover a range of topics including a number about CPAP machines and going back to school.   When can children go back to school? CBC Kids tells us the No. 1 question about COVID-19 they're hearing is when will children get to go back to school. Adults are also wondering when this will all be over, including Anastasia from Bainsville, Ont. Every province is dealing with their COVID-19 outbreaks differently, which means schools in some provinces could open up earlier than others. There is no definitive date.   Dr. Brian Goldman — host of CBC Radio's White Coat Black Art and new podcast The Dose — says once public health officials confirm we're past the peak of COVID-19, and the number of cases starts going down, we'll be on the right track. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory But that's \"unlikely to happen in the next two to three weeks,\ " Goldman says.  \"I think all of us need to prepare for the strong possibility that school won't start again until June or the summer, or the fall.\ "    You can listen to more questions from kids on this episode of the CBC's The Current. Would a CPAP machine help as a ventilator? We received a lot of questions, including one from Bienvenido I., about whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines could be used to help COVID-19 patients. The limited supply of ventilators is one of the key concerns facing hospitals as they prepare for more COVID-19 cases. CPAP machines are used to provide minor breathing support to sleep apnea patients. However, one doctor says they're not a substitute for ventilators. \"If someone was pretty sick with [COVID-19,] I don't think that would particularly help them,\" said Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious diseases specialist and chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital. He also warned that CPAP machines might help spread the virus. \"They're one of the devices we worry about that may be responsible for some of the spread,\" particularly in hospitals and in long-term care homes, he said. What is the treatment for mild cases of COVID-19?   Michael F. asked about what to do if you have a mild case of COVID-19. Right now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. If your symptoms are mild, the best thing to do is to stay home, says Gardam.   Health Canada's advice is the same: if you have symptoms, isolate yourself for 14 days to avoid spreading the virus. But if you're having trouble breathing or experiencing a high fever that doesn't break, Gardam suggests going to the hospital for treatment, which could include oxygen and acetaminophen. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Gardam joins Heather Hiscox to answer COVID-19 questions. 4:56 If a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, can they get sick again with the virus later? This question is on the minds of many Canadians, including Jeff L.   Since this is a new coronavirus, little is known about it and experts don't have an answer to that question yet.   However, infectious disease expert Dr. Allison McGeer in Toronto says there's \"good reason to hope\" that if you've had COVID-19 once, you'll be protected for at least a few months or a couple of years. But she can't be sure. Read more about what we know about the virus in here. I have an elderly relative who lives on her own and needs my assistance. How do I safely visit to help with her needs? Many Canadians, including Alyssa and Jackie, want to know how to care for older friends and family. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch admits it's a challenging situation, because everyone needs to practise physical distancing, and the elderly are a vulnerable population. But some seniors who live alone need help. Bogoch says the best thing to do if you have to make a house call is practise impeccable hand hygiene, and to make sure anyone who has symptoms does not go inside.    Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus in Canada, including whether cloth masks are a good idea for essential workers. 3:54 On Monday we answered questions about delivered groceries and pregnancies.

  Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The province currently has 270 ventilators, according to a spokesperson for Shared Health.  An additional 16 have been ordered, Health Minister Cameron Friesen said Wednesday. Manitoba's population was roughly 1.38 million in the first quarter of 2020, according to Statistics Canada. That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive. The total does not include ventilators in operating rooms, which are a different type of machine not preferred for critical care or cardiac patients, said Lanette Siraugsa, chief nursing officer for Shared Health, on Saturday. Those machines could be used to treat COVID-19 patients in \"certain situations,\ " she said, but aren't the preferred method. Based on a CBC breakdown of reported ventilators and provincial populations across the country, Manitoba ranks roughly in the middle. Ontario, with a capacity of roughly 12.3 ventilators to 100,000 people, is near the bottom, while Quebec leads the country, with an anticipated capacity of roughly 35.1 ventilators per 100,000 people. Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines. They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.   (CBC News) But countries around the world are facing shortages of the machines as the explosion of cases overwhelms health-care systems. In the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, doctors have been forced to decide which patients get priority access, and which do not. That's the scenario Canada is bracing for — and scrambling to prevent — by finding more machines. Prevention also includes flattening the curve through public health measures like social distancing, said Dr. Atul Kapur, an emergency physician in Ottawa and co-chair of the public affairs committee of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. \"Right now, we don't have anywhere close to the capacity or the number of ventilators for the demand that we're anticipating, by looking at what other countries [experience],\" Kapur said. When it comes to ventilators per capita, Ontario's near the bottom \"This is unprecedented. The estimates that we have had so far are just not holding up to the demand that COVID is causing,\" he continued. \"And even now, it's a bit difficult, because we don't know how bad it's going to get.\ " Manitoba preparing 'for the worst case': Top doctor Most Canadian hospitals operate near 100 per cent capacity \"at the best of times,\ " Kapur said. That means they don't have the \"buffer\" to handle a sudden surge in demand — and neither did many other countries. \"That's the problem,\ " Kapur said. \"We're fighting with every other country to increase our numbers.\" Canada's readiness is a \"mixed picture,\ " Kapur said. The country is orders of magnitude away from what it would need for its worst-case scenario. \"Even the best case scenario ... Right now, we don't have the capacity to deal with what that would be,\" Kapur said. \"But hopefully we have time, in a matter of weeks, to build that up.\" Health minister asks Manitoba businesses to provide products, supplies for hospitals during pandemic It's difficult to pinpoint an ideal number of ventilators for Manitoba because the path of the virus in this province could change based on multiple variables, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. \"There's a large variability in the modelling numbers that we have. And so we're looking to prepare not only for the expected case but we're looking to prepare for the worst case,\ " Roussin said at a daily news briefing Thursday. WATCH | Experts say Canada could come up against ventilator shortage in weeks Canada could face a shortage of ventilators within a few weeks if cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. 2:00 \"I don't have a specific number that I could tell you. But we are putting things in place to prepare for worst case scenarios, and so ventilators, critical care beds, those type of things, are part of that plan,\ " Roussin said. The province has called on private businesses to donate ventilators and other supplies. On Friday, Friesen said public health officials have also had talks with manufacturers to see if they could make more of the machines, or other needed equipment. There's also nuance behind the numbers, said Dr. Kelly MacDonald, the head of the section of infectious disease in the department of internal medicine for the University of Manitoba and the WRHA. Respiratory therapists are needed to run the machines. Unions have already raised concerns about staffing levels at Winnipeg hospitals. Respiratory care at HSC overburdened, understaffed even before COVID-19, unions say Health-care experts are also working to find alternatives. Kapur noted some doctors are working on ways to rig ventilators to help two or three patients at a time, instead of just one, for example. \"I think that providing good health care and survival has a lot more to do with a variety of other things, other than just the machines,\ " MacDonald said. Ability to 'change our destiny' in Manitoba: emerging virus expert One of the traits of a COVID-19 outbreak that makes it so hard on health-care systems is a pattern of sickening patients all at once, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair of emerging viruses. Across the world, health-care systems have seen a sudden influx of very sick patients all at once, rather than staggered, like with influenza, he said.   He hopes that Manitoba has had enough warning to take action and flatten the curve, so that impact won't be as overwhelming here. He praised Manitoba's actions so far on implementing physical distancing measures, and said Manitobans have done a good job of responding to the call so far. \"It's not necessarily just one variable where the virus hits and then you need all the ventilators,\ " Kindrachuk said. \"We still have the ability right now to kind of change our destiny a little bit with what's going to happen in Winnipeg.\ " It's critical for Manitobans to act responsibly now to mitigate some of the pressure that will be placed on the health-care system, MacDonald said. \"Ultimately, how this goes is going to be as much an issue of how we do as a society, as it will be an issue of how people do at hospitals.\ "
 Travel to and from the N.W.T. community of Deline has been restricted to only essential traffic. The Délı̨nę Got'ı̨nę Government made the announcement Monday, in a press release dated April 20. According to a directive banning non-essential travel, \"visits from all outside communities by land, water or air is prohibited\" unless approved by the local emergency measures co-ordinator or the chief. The restrictions have been put in place to protect the health of community members during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  While transit services in Toronto and Montreal are taking extra cleaning measures around the coronavirus outbreak, Ottawa's OC Transpo and the STO in Gatineau, Que. , are not. The TTC and Metrolinx in the Toronto area first stepped up cleaning measures in January, now wiping down areas of high contact daily with heavy-duty products. The TTC is spraying its buses overnight.   In Montreal, the STM is gradually introducing a new train-cleaning program, where interiors will be fully washed every seven days and buses are being cleaned weekly with soaps and disinfectants.   There have been confirmed cases of the respiratory illness in both cities, with none in Ottawa.   TTC, GO Transit step up cleaning, disinfecting of vehicles amid COVID-19 concern How Montreal's public transit agencies are preparing for COVID-19   OC Transpo said Thursday it has been closely monitoring the situation and working with public health officials to assess what supplies and cleaning measures are needed.   \"OC Transpo conducts daily cleaning on its buses, utilizing disposable antibacterial towel/wipes and all-purpose spray cleaner for glass and surfaces,\" said its chief safety officer Jim Hopkins in an email. \"The daily cleaning includes front dash (i.e. fare boxes) and rear dash, sun visor, all handrails and stanchion posts and stairwell on double-decker [buses]. \"Additionally, our buses undergo detailed interior cleaning every 180 days which include scrubbing, washing, rinsing and drying of the interior, including the glasses, upholstery and stairwell area for double-deckers.\ " Hopkins said OC Transpo's trains are cleaned daily and undergo deep cleaning every 21 service days on Line 1 and 92 days on Line 2.   Those fare gates and ticket machines are also wiped down daily.   Fare gates on the Confederation Line Sept. 16, 2019. (CBC) The STO in Gatineau is also watching the situation closely, but not doing anything extra yet.   A spokesperson confirmed that buses are washed once a week at each refueling, including the grab bars and the driver's station. The buses undergo a complete interior cleaning every two months.   Would it work?   One virus expert is cautioning that extra cleaning must be  done right.   \"There is a high probability of actually spreading the virus if not enough detergent is being used or if the rags are not being changed frequently enough,\" said Marc-André Langlois, Canada Research Chair in molecular virology and intrinsic immunity at the University of Ottawa.   \"What might happen is that these maintenance people will be actually spreading the contagious virus to larger surfaces.\ " Ottawa cleans the inside of its buses daily, while Gatineau does so once a week. (CBC) Langlois said the virus can live on surfaces for several days if the conditions are correct — not too hot, too cold or too wet. He said those doing the cleaning would have to have special protocol training to ensure they weren't spreading the virus. Just wash your hands More importantly is that people are well educated on how to protect themselves against the virus, he said. \"You see people with masks, the masks do absolutely nothing. If they're wearing rubber gloves or whatever, that does not protect them,\" he said. \"What protects you is to avoid any aspiration of droplets that may contain the virus. That is the key.  The general recommendation is just don't touch your face, hand washing.\ " He said proper hand washing is the other key and suggests doing so especially after commuting.     
  The latest:   Worldwide COVID-19 death toll tops 100,000. U.S. sees more than 35,000 new cases and 2,108 deaths on Friday. Government documents reveal a slow start to Canada's COVID-19 response. Canadian military intelligence unit issued warning about Wuhan outbreak back in January. Emergencies Act talks rejected by premiers, deemed a distraction. Health experts are calling for increased COVID-19 testing   —  so why isn't Canada testing everyone? INTERACTIVE |  Tracking the coronavirus in Canada.   The worldwide death toll from the coronavirus topped 100,000 on Friday, with the U.S. seeing more than 2,000 deaths in one day, according to the running tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.   The sad milestone comes as Christians around the globe mark a Good Friday unlike any other — in front of computer screens instead of in church pews. Meanwhile, some countries are tiptoeing toward reopening segments of their battered economies. In Canada, a physician who tweeted about an elderly patient who chose to forgo a ventilator is now asking the government not to forget about community doctors during the pandemic.   On Thursday, Dr. Nadia Alam of Georgetown, Ont., posted a tweet about a 72-year-old man with worsening COVID-19 symptoms she treated that day. Despite the fact that his condition was quickly worsening, Alam said, he did not want to be hooked up to the machine sometimes critical to keep COVID-19 patients alive. \"He turned to me and said 'If I go, if I die from this, I would rather die looking at the sky. I would rather die looking at my family,'\ " Alam told CBC's Rosemary Barton in a Friday interview. I’m starving. Thirsty. Tired. I wore my N95 mask for 7 hours straight.

And we watched the sky. <a href=\"https://t.co/jDoQpIpRwn\">pic.twitter.com/jDoQpIpRwn</a>&mdash;@DocSchmadia   Instead, Alam sat with the man, and called his family.   That tweet struck a chord with Canadians as it was shared widely online, but Alam said there is another pressing issue she would like addressed.   While hospitals are already struggling with dangerously low supplies of personal protective equipment like gowns and masks, Alam said many family doctors have already run out completely. And while the government has launched measures to supply hospitals, it's important local doctors have the equipment they need as well.    WATCH |   Doctor talks about the 'desperation, sadness and hope' around putting COVID-19 patients on life support Dr. Nadia Alam of Georgetown, Ont., describes how one elderly patient didn't want to be on a ventilator and how her children are afraid that she, too, may get sick. 10:28 \"I know that you're focused on the hospitals — please don't forget about the communities,\ " Alam said, \"because that is where we take care of our pregnant patients, that is where we take care of little kids, that is where I take care of my patients with heart failure and cancer, for pain control.\" Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Trudeau addressed the issue of health-care workers contracting the virus, and the need for hospital workers to have personal protective equipment. He said health workers need to know \"that we have their back\" and have the support they need. Other health workers have already expressed concern about shortages of the protective gear they need.   Thefts in hospitals lead to lock up of masks, protective gear amid COVID-19 supply shortage   The daily briefing outside Rideau Cottage also looked at financial assistance to businesses and the supply of personal protective equipment, but the prime minister also took questions about testing, saying that expanded testing will be a \"key part\" of the path forward. After facing calls for more data about what was driving decisions, Canadian federal health officials on Thursday presented modelling information on how the outbreak could unfold.   Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said that the models aren't crystal balls — but they \"help us to plan and they tell us that our collective actions can have a direct and significant impact on the epidemic trajectory.\ " WATCH | Trudeau lays groundwork for never-used Emergencies Act: Sources tell CBC News that the federal government has sent a letter to provinces and territories as part of the consultation period — a required step before triggering a public welfare emergency. 6:21 The models suggest that even with stringent public health measures, Canada could see 4,400 deaths linked to the growing epidemic. That figure — the most optimistic in the models presented — is just one of the projections offered by officials, who stressed that how people behave now will be critical to how the epidemic evolves. Health officials projected that 11,000 Canadians would die over the course of the pandemic if 2.5 per cent of the population was infected, a number that increased to 22,000 if the infection rate hit five per cent of the population. All the projections are \"highly sensitive\" to behaviours, Tam said as health officials outlined models with strict measures as well as offering a glimpse into what might have happened without controls.   Get the details of the models and projections and learn more about how to interpret COVID-19 disease models.   Public health officials have urged people to stay home, avoid large gatherings and keep up physical distancing, handwashing and other measures. Trudeau said that people generally come together at this time of year, \"but this weekend is going to be very different.\" Families and religious communities will need to find ways to connect despite physical separation. Even Easter egg hunts will be different, Trudeau said, as families stay home. WATCH | Public health officials want people to stay apart to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Here's a look at how to do that in some tricky situations:   Physical distancing has radically changed how we socialize. But there’s still some scenarios where it’s difficult to limit our physical contact with others. Here’s how to best navigate them. 3:23 His remarks came a day after he cautioned that public health measures won't be lifted any time soon, a subject he returned to Friday. He said the government is talking with provinces, experts and industry about how and when restrictions might be lifted — but noted that Canada is still in the \"first phase\" of the spread of the virus. He said it's possible Canada would be out of the first wave this summer, and at that point a loosening of some rules could occur.   \"We'll have to be very careful about how we do that,\ " he said, noting that the country would still need to be vigilant about a resurgence of the virus. WHO cautions against easing movement restrictions Elsewhere, as weeks of lockdowns were extended in nation after nation, world governments were pressed to ease restrictions on key businesses and industries. After a two-week freeze on all non-essential economic activity, Spain decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed. In Italy, the industrial lobbies in regions representing 45 per cent of its economic output urged the government to ease its two-week lockdown on all non-essential manufacturing, saying the country \"risks definitively shutting down its own motor, and every day that passes the risk grows not to be able to restart it.\" The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that a premature lifting of restrictions could \"lead to a deadly resurgence.\ "   WATCH |  WHO warns against lifting restrictions too quickly The World Health Organization says that lifting restrictions prematurely during the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a deadly resurgence of the virus. 1:35 He said there had been a \"welcome slowing\" of the epidemic in  some European countries — Italy, Germany, Spain and France — but there had been an \"alarming acceleration\" elsewhere including community transmission in 16 countries of Africa.   The novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV2, was first reported in China in late 2019. There is no known cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. While most people who contract the illness will experience mild to moderate symptoms, health officials have cautioned that certain segments of the population, including the elderly and people with pre-existing health issues, face a higher risk of severe disease and death.    Canada lost more than 1 million jobs last month as COVID-19 struck   The Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been posting updated information about the virus, says that COVID-19 is a \"serious health threat.\" The agency says that risk varies between communities but notes that the overall risk to Canadians is \ " considered high.\"  Read on for a look at what's happening in Canada and around the world.   Here's what's happening in the provinces and territories As of midnight ET on Friday, Canada had more than 22,100 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19.
