The back-to-back launches were the most high-profile among a series of weapons tests that North Korea has conducted recently amid stalled nuclear talks and outside worries about a possible coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The weapons flew more than 150 kilometres off the North's east coast, a South Korean defence official said.
If confirmed, it would be the North's first cruise missile launch since June 2017, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing department rules.
The official said North Korea has recently appeared to be resuming its military drills that it had scaled back due to concerns about the coronovirus pandemic.
In recent weeks, North Korea has test-launched a variety of missiles and other weapons amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations with the United States.

Some experts say North Korean cruise missiles target U.S. naval assets that would be reinforced in the event of an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
A test of a missile capable of reaching the U.S. homeland would end North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on major weapons tests and likely completely derail nuclear diplomacy with the United States.

Kim Jong-un's disappearance from the public eye has raised speculation about the North Korean leader's health as well as who would take over should anything happen to him.
North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security.
Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, he discussed coronavirus prevention at the meeting and elected his sister, Kim Yo-jong, as an alternate member of the political bureau of the ruling Workers' Party.
Questions about Kim Jong-un's health flared after he skipped an April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his late grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il-sung.

\"I think it's entirely plausible that Kim Jong-un may have had an operation, or have had some sort of [other] health issue, because it's very unlikely for the leader of North Korea to miss Kim Il-sung's birthday on April 15,\" said North Korea expert Tina Park, co-founder and executive director of the Canadian Centre for the Responsibility to Protect at the University of Toronto and vice-president of the NATO Association of Canada.
\"He missed it and the public would have noticed it and all the experts agree that that is a very unusual kind of movement on the part of North Korean leadership.\" North Korea watchers also note that the dictator is not known for his healthy habits.
\"Kim Jong-un is not exactly the poster boy for healthy living,\" said Marius Grinius, an Asia-Pacific security expert and retired director general of international security policy for Canada's Department of National Defence.

Maxar Technologies-38 North/Handout/Reuters) Danny Russel, a former U.S. National Security Council director and assistant secretary of state for Asia who has dealt with North Korea in the past, cautioned that rumours have abounded for years about Kim, his father and his grandfather, and most turned out to have been false.
\"While serving in government I was on the receiving end of multiple intelligence reports about alleged accidents, illnesses and assassination attempts against North Korean leaders — only to have them reappear in public,\" he said. '
\"I think the report was incorrect,\" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.
Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea's nuclear arsenal.
U.S. President Donald Trump, right, last met with Kim in 2019 at the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea in Panmunjom, South Korea. (
South Korean government officials, as well as a Chinese official with the Liaison Department, challenged reports suggesting that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.
\"We have no information to confirm regarding rumours about Chairman Kim Jong-un's health issue that have been reported by some media outlets,\" South Korean presidential spokesperson Kang Min-seok said.
North Korea fires more missiles than ever amid coronavirus outbreak The South Korean presidential office later said Kim is believed to be staying at an unspecified location outside of Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, with some close confidants.

China sends medical experts China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.
Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.

\"Among the North's power elite, Kim Yo-jong has the highest chance to inherit power, and I think that possibility is more than 90 per cent,\" said analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.
\"North Korea is like a dynasty, and we can view the Paektu descent as royal blood, so it's unlikely for anyone to raise any issue over Kim Yo-jong taking power.\" Kim Yo-jong, the North Korean leader's sister, is a likely candidate to step in if her brother is gravely ill, incapacitated or dies. (
Jorge Silva/File/Reuters) Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor of Korean Studies at Tufts University in Burlington, Mass., said Kim Yo-jong has \"elevated her stature in recent weeks.\" \"In March, for example, for the first time under her own name she issued a statement slamming the South Korean president, calling him a scared dog, an idiot,\" he told CBC Radio's The Current.

North Korea says Pompeo's 'reckless remarks' made them lose interest in talks with U.S. But some experts say a collective leadership, which could end the family's dynastic rule, could also be possible.
\"North Korean politics and the three hereditary power transfers have been male-centred.
I wonder whether she [Kim Yo-jong] can really overcome bloody socialist power struggles and exercise her power,\" said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University in South Korea.
A collective leadership would likely be headed by Choe Ryong-hae, North Korea's ceremonial head of state who officially ranks No.
Tedros said 90 per cent of the cases are in just four countries and two of them, China and South Korea, are seeing \"significantly declining epidemics.\" Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO's emergencies program, said Iran and Italy are on the front line of the outbreak now — but he cautioned that other countries will soon be dealing with larger case numbers.

South Korea has had fewer cases and deaths than Canada and its government saw a bump in the polls ahead of this past week's parliamentary elections, in part due to its handling of the virus.
