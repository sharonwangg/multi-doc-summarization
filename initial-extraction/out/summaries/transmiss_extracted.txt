\"My message for younger people would be that even if you don't have a chronic health condition, you need to make sure that you are protecting yourself against COVID-19, because even if you yourself have a mild illness, you could spread that disease to others and continue to be a part of having disease spread in your community, could be a link to having other people who get severe illness.
\"With the switch in our testing strategies, we're really focused on understanding where in our communities are we seeing local transmission, and how we can put a stop to that.\" Public health officials will also watch to see whether new measures put in place at long-term-care facilities are effective in combating outbreaks.
Dr. Sarah Cook, territorial medical director of health with the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority, says the territory is prepared for community transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. (
\"If we're doing a really good job in the territory — and we don't have community transmission — and people let their guards down, that's really, I think, the biggest risk for us.\" Community transmission is the spread of illness from person to person without knowing where contact with the virus was made.
Community transmission would be a new and potentially dangerous phase for the N.W.T. \"As soon as the virus starts to spread between people, we may rapidly start seeing an increase in the number of cases,\" Cook said.
\"That again is why it's so important to maintain that physical distance, washing your hands, making sure you're following all of the advice of the chief public health officer — [it's] to prevent any transmission that could occur if someone happened to have the virus and wasn't showing any symptoms.\" The only way to prevent community spread is to \"keep people away from each other.\" A lineup outside a Yellowknife liquor store on April 9.
Cook says the territory is not only prepared, but expects the eventual arrival of community transmission.
\"We have prepared and planned for this and we expect community transmission will occur as it has … almost everywhere else.\" It could bring new restrictions on movement, and even reassessment of what counts as essential services.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, said about 24 per cent of all cases in Toronto are due to community transmission.
The newest case is linked to travel, but the province's chief medical officer, Dr. Robert Strang, said there's work underway to ramp up testing in an effort to detect possible community spread of the virus.
If we don't do it stringently and we continue to see extensive amounts of so-called community or a wider transmission because people are not adhering to that, then it will go longer again because we have not maintained that type of discipline in that time,\" Williams said.
While now the focus is on travel-related cases and the general public who may have been in contact with someone who's tested positive, that's going to change shortly, especially once community transmitted cases have been confirmed.
\"At this time, no cases show clear evidence of community spread but we all need to be prepared that this will happen and may be happening right now and we'll pick it up with our expanded testing,\" he said.

The steps Canada has taken to curb the spread of this virus may be \"flattening the curve,\" but we cannot forget that the vast majority of our population will continue to be susceptible to infection in the absence of measures that:  Reduce the proportion of Canadians who are susceptible (a vaccine) Reliably tell us who is no longer susceptible (an antibody test) Effectively treat illness caused by COVID-19 (drugs) Interrupt transmission chains (widespread contact tracing)  Until an effective combination of these measures becomes possible, or the virus simply stops circulating in this part of the world, Canadians must resist drawing the conclusion that we can lower our guard.

\"If we can delay community transmission to beyond the normal typical flu season, then we can provide some slack in the health-care system to address things like shortages of beds and the burden on health-care systems that often times flu season exacerbates,\" she said.
\"The real question right now is will it get better at going in what we call 'sustained transmission' from human to human.
\"It never really developed the capability of having sustained vigorous transmission from person to person,\" said Fauci.
\"There was clearly person-to-person transmission but it wasn't like influenza.
Community transmission of the COVID-19 respiratory illness is likely taking place in Ottawa, according to the city's chief medical officer of health.
We simply recommend that while outside you make sure to avoid crowds and maintain a distance of [one to two metres] from those around you.\" Dr. Vera Etches, with Ottawa Public Health, says local transmission of COVID-19 in Ottawa may mean there are several hundred cases currently in the community.
As restrictions are gradually loosened in New Brunswick, Public Health will be keeping an eye out for two possible scenarios — cluster events and community transmissions.
Officials also modelled the emergence of community transmission, based on the scenario of three distinct community outbreaks in Edmundston, Petit-Rocher and Saint John.
\"The fact that we can identify that those are part of a transmission cluster is a good sign.\" 'Pop-up' community transmissions It's a good sign in contrast to \"pop-up\" cases, which is what Roussin and MacDonald say would be considered the truer and more worrisome sign that community transmission is occurring.
The first place pop-up community transmission is likely to occur is in highly mobile people in the general population —those who already have illnesses and those who could have a big impact in spreading it, like health-care workers.
One of the main ways of staving off catastrophe is to prevent or delay pop-up community transmission through social distancing.
\"That's why these disease curves start out kind of flat and then they suddenly go straight up, is because of that\" pop-up community transmission, she said.
Up to 60 of those cases may have been caused by community transmission.

Possible' there was limited human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus in China, WHO says China reports 1st death from 'new type of coronavirus' The appearance of the first known case outside of China has elevated concerns that the mysterious virus — thought to be linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan — could pop up here in Canada.
Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) Legault has described the pandemic in Quebec as existing in two worlds: the beleaguered long-term care homes, known in French as centres d'hébergement de soins de longue durée (CHSLDs), and seniors' homes, and the rest of the population where community transmission is decreasing.
If sustained, the province has a chance at flattening the curve of the virus, he said.
The two cases of apparent community transmission, men in their 90s and 40s, are both residents of the Fraser Health region who are currently in isolation at home.
The outbreak at the care home began with B.C.'s first recorded case of community transmission, a woman in her 50s.
James Cadigan said everyone has a \"role to play in achieving our goal to flatten the curve.\" \"We are imploring upon our community to do what we all do best, take care of each other,\" he said.
COVID-19 cases linked to a long-term care home in that community have prompted a curfew that residents say has turned the community into a \"ghost town.\" A long-term care resident, a staff member at the same facility and two others in the community have tested positive.
Health authorities suspect he contracted the virus through community transmission.

We need to protect them and our best line of defence is to reduce community transmission: stay at home as much as possible and, when you do go out, practise physical distancing,\" she added.
In a worst-case scenario, there would be full-blown COVID-19 outbreaks at every city-run shelter and long-term care home and there would be significant community transmission, he added.
\"Certainly we know a significant proportion of our current cases are close contacts to cases.\" He estimated about 10 per cent of cases were caused by community transmission.
