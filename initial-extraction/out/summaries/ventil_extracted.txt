The ICU figure was the state's lowest total in two weeks and a sign for optimism as beleaguered hospitals, particularly in New York City and surrounding areas, have confronted escalating demands for scarce ventilators for patients and personal protective equipment for medical staff.
About 94 cer cent of the ICU admissions in his state related to COVID-19 require the use of ventilators, he said.
New York state is poised to get over 1,100 ventilators from China and Oregon as it scrambles to line up more breathing machines for the sickest coronavirus patients.
Cuomo says the state of Oregon volunteered to send 140 more breathing machines Governors across the U.S. have been desperately pleading for more supplies — particularly ventilators — and shopping global markets as they try to keep their states safe, as the Trump administration has limited access to a federal stockpile that's dwindling fast.
He also said that New York at one point made purchase orders for 17,000 of the breathing machines, but only 2,500 came through.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has already complained that U.S. states are competing against each other for protective gear and breathing machines, or being outbid by the federal government.

He turns a knob and as quickly as the device begins to purr, the air gauge on an artificial lung its connected to rises and falls with the robotic precision of someone breathing with the assistance of a machine.
While the standard for a conventional ventilator uses a mask or nose tubes and follows current guidelines, the pandemic ventilator is at a standard from the 1970s and requires a patient be intubated, the medical word used to describe putting a tube through someone's mouth and into their airway.

He was so sick that he needed mechanical ventilation to breathe.
Cough, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia in both lungs are among the symptoms of the novel coronavirus, Health Canada says.
How COVID-19 progresses from incubation to recovery has implications for everything from how long people may spread it before showing symptoms, to how long people can be expected to occupy resources such as ICU beds and ventilators in hospitals.
That is lung inflammation and fluid build-up in the lungs that stops air from getting in and causes blood oxygen levels to drop.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome typically requires life support such as mechanical ventilation that must be administered in the ICU.
Smith said the new policies will help \"stabilize outbreaks in many of these settings.\" ICU cases, patients on ventilators dip slightly The total number of people battling COVID-19 in Ontario hospitals increased slightly, up to 887 from 878.

Such problems include insufficient tests, slow results, scarcity of protective gear, the shortage of breathing machines for seriously ill patients and burned-out staffs anxious for their own safety.
How to set priorities for the use of ventilators, breathing machines that can sustain life, is one of the most worrisome questions.
A deadly flu was raging through the battlefields, causing fever and fatigue, pounding headaches and sore throats, before filling the lungs with fluid and choking the breath from its victims.
(Montreal Heart Institute) Tardif, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Université de Montréal, says the drug could mitigate the lung inflammation which leaves many COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe.
Here's how to make sense of itMade-in-Canada ventilators, masks, test kits coming soon: Trudeau That reduced demand is also impacting the air we breathe, with pollution dropping in Calgary and Edmonton and along the main highway that links the two.
So, much like he'd done thousands of times before, Trivedi put on protective gear and began the high-risk intubation procedure, carefully inserting a plastic tube down the man's windpipe so he could be connected to a ventilator, the machine that would move air in and out of his lungs to keep him alive.
He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Patient temperatures and oxygen saturation levels will be monitored multiple times a day, to ensure they don't take a sudden turn at home alone, according to a news release from Island Health.

They're trying to find people to fill these open shifts.\" Ventilators have been key to helping COVID-19 patients keep breathing.
Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton.
While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (
\"Demand for acute services will exceed existing capacity for hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators as well as creating a major burden on other acute services, supports, HR, supplies, and equipment,\" read one page from the PowerPoint presentation, which is dated March 19-20.

We'll be there to offer accommodations.\" 'Overburdened'  In many provinces, the decision to cancel elective surgeries has freed up space with more of the country's 73,000 hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients, many of whom need oxygen or ventilators to cope the breathing problems that come with the virus.
While it's not clear, cumulatively, how many of Saskatchewan's COVID-19 cases have needed a ventilator, the maximum number of coronavirus cases who have been under intensive care (ICU) at the same time is known to be two.
Health officials in Saskatchewan and elsewhere have undertaken the grim but necessary exercise of contemplating who would get a ventilator should hospitals be swarmed with serious cases while not having enough machines to go around.
\"Putting a breathing tube in somebody is a very routine activity for an anesthesiologist and many other health care professionals,\" Shaw said.

\"The government has never invested to keep up with the growth of the population.\" Critical Care Services Ontario, a government body that was formed out of the SARS outbreak, said in a recent report the province set up its ventilator reserve in 2010 with 216 machines — which is actually six more than it has now, a decade later.
N95 masks are being used by doctors and nurses performing procedures known to generate microdroplets, such as inserting a tube in a patient's mouth and throat during surgery, or using an inflating bag and a mask to help someone who is having trouble breathing.
However, if you have a sharp turn in your condition, including shortness of breath, call 911 or your local emergency number.
The U.S. Air Force has been shuttling COVID-19 test kits to various parts of the country, while the Pentagon has turned thousands of ventilators over to overstretched civilian hospitals.
We're about to find outAnalysisMilitarizing a pandemic: Defence experts say idea of sending U.S. troops to border makes no senseIndigenous pandemic needs grow as federal funds prepare to flow Recently, the Italian military employed specialists to help the country increase production of medically-necessary ventilators that help the most critically-ill patients breathe.
Having that mask could be the difference between life and death for a patient, because doctors and nurses need to protect themselves from viral contamination before they can insert a breathing tube.
He also knows there won't be enough ventilators — mechanical breathing machines that can keep critically ill COVID-19 patients alive long enough for their lungs to recover.
What to do if you think you have COVID-19 The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to a common cold or seasonal flu, and can include fever, cough, difficulty breathing and pneumonia in both lungs.
Here's what you need to know That means doctors are only able to offer supportive care for patients who are seriously ill, including providing ventilator breathing assistance if they become critically ill.
About 39 per cent (831) were moderately sick, with pneumonia or lung lesions, but no obvious shortness of breath, according to the report, Epidemiology of COVID-19 among Children in China.
The medical machines are used to help those hit hard by COVID-19 to keep breathing.
He suggests the federal government should move swiftly to procure a special order for the mechanical breathing machines, based on the provinces' requests for additional gear.

At the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, many emergency departments were immediately placing COVID-19 patients with alarmingly low levels of oxygen on mechanical ventilators, a standard practice for a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
CBC) COVID-19 patients, like those suffering from ARDS, have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood, which leads to breathing problems.
This \"remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS,\" he writes, adding that patients with normal looking lungs but low oxygen are at risk of lung injury from the ventilators, where pressure from the air damages the thin air sacs that exchange oxygen with the blood.
Oxygen without force Garrone says his emergency department now begins with non-invasive ventilation — different ways of getting oxygen into patients' lungs without force, such as a mask or a nasal cannula.
This helps people in the early stages of the disease to inhale enough oxygen without damaging their lungs.
Garrone said it's when ICU units get overwhelmed that the risk of misuse of ventilators is highest. '

Paul Sancya/The Associated Press) In addition, Canada imports 75 per cent of its medical equipment, including X-ray machines and ventilators.
Canada's hospitals are counting their ventilators used to assist breathing in critically ill patients.
Of the people infected, 29 are in ICU in hospital, 20 of them on ventilators.
The coronavirus that causes the illness binds to receptors on cells in a person's airway and lungs, and in severe cases, it's the respiratory system that will struggle to do its job oxygenating a patient's blood.
In the simplest terms, a ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe.
Ventilators shouldn't be confused with respirators, which are simply masks to breathe through that filter out dust, viruses, or other things that could be harmful.
2:59 According to Tina Hsu, a respiratory therapist (RT) at Vancouver General Hospital and educational director with the B.C. Society of Respiratory Therapists, a ventilator pushes air into the lungs and allows air to escape.
\"The ventilators we're talking about here [in terms of COVID-19 patients] are going to be the ICU critical care ventilators,\" said Hsu.
\"Those ventilators are connected to medical air and medical oxygen.\" Respiratory therapists are at centre of COVID-19's 'emotional toll' The medical air tank is a mix of 21 per cent oxygen and 79 per cent nitrogen.
The ventilator measures everything,\" said Hsu, adding that the exhalation is passive as the lungs sort of spring back, pushing the air out.
A ventilator will have regulators to set the right mix of air and oxygen and a fan or turbine that manages the flow to the patient.
Air will pass through a humidifier and into the patient's lung, before being released through a separate tube.
According to Hsu, most of the sensors the machine uses to analyze the patient's breath will be on the tube going in.
In the case of COVID-19 patients, filters are added to the tubes exiting the lungs to keep the virus from entering the environment.
Ventilators are commonly used during sedation, in intensive care situations, or generally when there's something wrong with the way a patient's lungs are working.
A lung specialist and intensive care doctor explains how  COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the body \"We can't give as many breaths a minutes as we would like.
In such cases, a tracheostomy, or hole in the neck, is used, whereas COVID-19 cases would have a breathing tube.
\"A lot of what we do is trying to not cause further damage to the lungs.\" People get lung inflammation and scarring from being on high levels of oxygen for too long, said Hsu, and there's a risk of physically damaging the lung tissue with too much pressure.
Physical distancing has halved  rate of spread of COVID-19 in B.C., official modelling suggests She said the breathing tube can also cause pneumonia independent of COVID-19, and complications can arise from just being immobile for days on end in a hospital bed.
However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols, like inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages).
It grows in your lungs, and the virus comes out when you breathe.
At the time, there were about 3,200 ICU beds and almost 5,000 mechanical ventilators spread out in 286 hospitals across Canada.
Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines that will be critical for COVID-19 patients whose lungs are so badly damaged they have trouble getting enough oxygen.
Canada's hospitals are counting their ventilators, used to assist breathing in critically ill patients.
In Italy, health-care workers are already talking about the grim reality of \"triaging\" under strained circumstances, which means they're being forced to choose between life and what might have been a preventable death for some people, based on the availability of ventilators and ICU beds.

The goal, the source said, is \"to fight COVID and help come up with a cure.\" Ventilators in particular, could spell the difference between life and death for many patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus which can damage the lungs.
Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said that while there is no current shortage of ventilators, federal officials are trying to prevent one by managing existing inventories and securing more of the machines — preparing for the possibility that the COVID-19 caseload could start overwhelming hospitals.
Thousands of people who seem to think of little else these days have memorized the catch phrases, such as \"social distancing\" and \"community transmission\" and \"flattening the curve.\" Kenney said Alberta has enough ventilators, hospital beds and ICU beds to cope with COVID-19, even though the peak of the outbreak is likely still weeks away.
\"Similar to a ventilator, it has all of the controls that are necessary to push air into your lungs and help you breath,\" Stankiewicz said.
Her team has been adding extra components to the machine to make it function more like a regular ventilator, and communicate a patient's condition more accurately to the doctor or nurse.
Lowering costs Using a BiPap machine and the additional components would cost as little as a tenth of what a regular ventilator costs, which can be up to $50,000.
A manufacturer of medical ventilators says Canada should have stockpiled the machines after Toronto's 2003 SARS outbreak, given they are now harder to come by as hospitals around the world scramble to buy more with the outbreak of COVID-19.

Fitzgerald also provided the number of ventilators at the disposal of health authorities, saying there are 156 of the machines — which have proved vital for keeping severely ill patients alive — spread across the province.
\"If we continue with a 20 or 30 or 40 per cent day-on-day increase in the number of people in the ICU, we'll be out of beds with ventilators in the province in less than two weeks.\"   Capacity can be expanded: province Ontario hospitals have a total of 2,053 adult critical-care beds, according to the Ministry of Health's figures, and officials say pandemic plans would allow the system to expand its ICU capacity.
Scientists have found something they didn't think existed: an animal that can't breathe oxygen, and obviously doesn't need to.
It lives in the muscles of salmon and trout, causing unsightly little white nodules known as \"tapioca disease.\" The parasite has just 10 cells and is smaller than many of the cells in our bodies, but it has the ability to live without the machinery to turn oxygen into energy, researchers say.

Now imagine having a child admitted to the intensive care unit, with a breathing tube down her throat — and not being able to be with her due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.
\"The doctor said, 'The positive part of this is that that we stopped the seizures by giving her the breathing tube, because now the oxygen is getting to her brain,\" she said.
\"You could tell he was waiting … because he knew that my reaction would be even worse.\"  Jayda had been put into an induced coma, the doctor said, with a breathing tube down her throat, and had been admitted into the intensive care unit at Regina General Hospital.
That includes CPR,  intubation (where a tube is inserted to help a person breathe) and the use of nebulizers, which give a patient medication in the form of a mist through a mask.
They'll need hospital, they'll need oxygen, and about five per cent of the total will be really sick and will be on a ventilator. \"
Cordero was in a medically induced coma on various machines to support his heart, lungs and kidneys.
As Montreal emergency physician Dr. Abdo Shabah explains, complications can arise beyond the typical flu and respiratory symptoms due to high levels of inflammation in the lungs, which can affect the level of oxygen in the blood and its delivery.
Cordero was on a dialysis machine, a ventilator and an ECMO machine Patients with severe cases may need a ventilator to help the lungs, a dialysis machine to support the kidneys, and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to assist the heart and lungs.
\"Medications to keep people comfortable, sedated when they're on breathing machines; medications to support blood pressure, for instance, are being used at a rate that exceeds the usual ability to supply many hospitals,\" adds Fowler, who works in a critical care unit.
We're a pretty close family so I just wish we could be there for him.\" Cameron has been on a ventilator for a week, Marshall said, although doctors recently lifted his sedation slightly to allow him to regain some of his breathing autonomy.

The gas has a pungent odour and in high concentrations it can irritate the lungs and cause coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing.
Manitoba appears to be in the middle of the pack among Canadian provinces for ventilators, as health-care systems across the country scramble to get more of the machines used to treat the sickest patients from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
That works out to a capacity of roughly 20.8 ventilators per 100,000 people, once the additional machines arrive.
Ventilators are mechanical breathing machines.
They're critical in the fight against COVID-19 in its sickest patients, whose lungs get so badly damaged by the disease they can't get enough oxygen to breathe on their own.
(Richard Agecoutay/CBC) Errett said his association had donated 10,000 N95 masks and three Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machines, plus all the equipment that goes along with them, to Wuhan.
ECMO machines act as an artificial lung, pumping oxygen in to a patient's blood, giving the respiratory and cardiovascular systems a rest.
Ramping up health-system response As a precaution, Alberta is ramping up its ICU, ventilator and personal protective equipment capacity based on an elevated, but less likely scenario.
For the purposes of health system planning, the scenarios assume all ICU patients will need the use of a ventilator and that generally, 14 per cent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, with five per cent needing time in intensive care.
More ICU beds ready by late April Alberta plans to have an additional 1,081 ICU beds ready by the end of April, and another 447 ventilators, bringing the total number of ventilators set aside for COVID-19 patients from 314 to 761.
Those preliminary studies point to the possibility hydroxychloroquine may lessen the effects of the illness, such as cough, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia in the lungs, and slow its spread.
