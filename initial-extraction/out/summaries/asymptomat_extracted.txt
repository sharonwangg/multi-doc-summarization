Gary Moore/CBC) If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted.
\"If this were airborne —  if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles — all those health-care workers would be getting sick.\" The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious.
That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.
The governor also released the preliminary results of a statewide antibody survey of about 15,000 people showing that 12.3 per cent were previously infected with the virus.
It confirmed the results of another test with a smaller sample size released about 10 days ago showing that one in five New York City residents has had the virus, with the Bronx bureau seeing the highest number positive for antibodies at 27.6 per cent.
With the crisis stabilizing in Europe and in many places in the U.S., countries and states are gradually easing their restrictions amid warnings from health experts that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically.
In Moscow, which accounts for half of all virus cases, all respiratory infections are likely to be caused by the coronavirus, according to the public health agency Rospotrebnadzor.
When Chinese health officials quickly genetically sequenced the virus from an infected patient, the WHO lauded the effort, calling it a \"notable achievement\" that \"demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\" CBC InvestigatesWhy some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claims \"But you do not also want to overdo it, to be too deferential and too friendly to the extent that you cannot take a step back and then question the things that they share with you,\" she said.
That means antibodies you created to fight off the virus the first time you are exposed may not be effective the next time.
The new ODNI statement says, \"The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\" \"The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" 'All available evidence' suggests COVID-19 had animal origin and wasn't produced in lab — WHONo, the new coronavirus wasn't created in a lab, scientists say \"The mere fact that we don't know the answers — that China hasn't shared the answers — I think is very, very telling,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said recently.
The caseload is officially more than 213,000, although Spain is not counting untested infections or those that are becoming known through antibody tests, which mostly identify patients after they have passed the COVID-19 disease.
For the virus to die out, the average number of people to whom an infected individual passes the virus has to drop below one.
He said it is too soon to talk about so called \"immunity passports\" for Canadians who've been infected with COVID-19 because the science is still unclear about whether those who have recovered from the virus are protected from catching it again.
They aid in diagnosis and are also important for the detective work of tracing contacts — those who may have been exposed to an infected person, such as family members, health-care workers or nearby travellers The swabs are typically inserted into a patient's nose and then sealed into a tube with growth medium to support the virus until it can get to the lab.
Instead of searching for the virus itself, these search for proteins in the blood called antibodies.
Your body produces antibodies weeks after successfully fighting off an infection.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it's a \"reasonable assumption\" that, if you have antibodies, you will be protected from another infection.
Herd immunity is conferred when enough people in a given population have been infected with a virus, marking them immune to reinfection and slowing down the rate at which the virus spreads on its own.
Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said herd immunity without a vaccine is \"theoretically possible\" if everyone, or almost everyone, who becomes infected develops antibodies that will protect them for life.
With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it.
South Korea's health authorities are planning to soon begin antibody tests to learn how widespread the coronavirus infection is within the population.
\"The outbreak has — as of today — become controllable and manageable again,\" Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference, adding that the health-care system had \"at no time been overwhelmed so far.\" Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the federal agency responsible for disease control, said the virus reproduction or transmission rate in Germany had dropped below one — meaning one person with the virus infects fewer than one other on average.
Researchers could take a musical counterpoint to the virus' melody and rhythm and, using artificial intelligence again, try to find an antibody that matches it.
Still, in a state of nearly 40 million people, that's not enough for public health officials to know for sure the reach of the highly contagious virus that is still causing outbreaks across the state in nursing homes and homeless shelters.
WATCH | Trump leaves it to states to decide when to reopen: U.S. president says administration will provide guidance despite lack of widespread COVID-19 testing 1:16 Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phased gradual reopening of businesses and schools, with each phase lasting at least 14 days, meant to ensure that the virus outbreak doesn't accelerate again.
Asymptomatic spread The processes set up to catch infections before workers arrive at the mine and once they are there hinges on them showing symptoms.
\"Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is occurring,\" noted the federal government last week in a summary of assumptions about the virus.
\"Shaking hands is absolutely one of the leading risk factors for transmitting or acquiring microbial infection such as COVID-19,\" said Paul Pottinger, an infectious disease professor at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The game plan is to open up but maintain enough physical distancing to prevent new flare-ups of the virus that has infected 2.4 million people worldwide, killed more than 165,000 and sent the global economy into a tailspin.
They say their hard-won successes over the past weeks of battling the virus will be for nought if they reopen their economies too soon and get hit by a second wave of infections.
Under the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the virus, Africa could see 3.3 million deaths and 1.2 billion infections, the report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa said.
Public health experts have warned that easing the shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back with a vengeance.
WECHU's look at the current situation in Windsor-Essex County Seniors homes (WECHU) Heron Terrace has seen 57 of its residents infected by the virus along with 20 of its staff.
Serology tests measure the antibodies that appear in the blood after someone has battled an infection — including those who don't even know they had COVID-19 because they didn't meet testing criteria, didn't seek care or had mild or no symptoms.
This data is important for policy makers deciding when to ease restrictions, said epidemiologist Patrick Saunders-Hastings, director of life sciences and environmental health at Gevity Consulting Inc. Without it, our picture of COVID-19's spread in Canada remains incomplete — diagnostic laboratory tests now in use largely focus on high-risk groups and only capture people actively infected with the virus.
As for the issue at hand: Antibody tests look for evidence of an immune response to the virus in the blood.
When someone becomes infected with the coronavirus, the body produces specific antibodies to fight the infection.
A rapid antibody blood test could also reveal who has been infected, even in asymptomatic cases.
\"We can actually test for the virus here at GLIER.\" Windsor manufacturer says producing thousands of N95 masks possible, but materials unavailableCOVID-19 testing ramped up at long-term care homes but families still worried McKay said research in other cities around the world showed that the infection rate was much higher than the reported confirmed cases, after studying feces in the sewage.

One new locally transmitted infection was reported in the latest data, in the southern province of Guangdong, down from five a day earlier in the same province.
While there are some viruses that mosquitoes and other insects carry, the coronavirus doesn't seem to be one of them and therefore cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites, says the World Health Organization.
He says the risk of being exposed to the virus by a passing jogger is \"very low.\" \"Generally speaking, this virus, as with many respiratory infections, is much more difficult to transmit outdoors than indoors,\" he says.
\"We hope that when you get infected with the virus, you develop sufficient immune protection to prevent subsequent infection, at least for a little while,\" he told CBC News.
It's not in itself a long-term solution.\"  Grad said serological testing — blood tests that can detect if someone has been infected and has antibodies against the virus — is the next key factor in developing an effective treatment for COVID-19.
3 categories of virus transmission An earlier study that focused on China, where the virus was first identified, suggested that more than 10 per cent of transmissions were from people who were infected but did not yet feel sick.
The seemingly healthy people who can transmit the virus are believed to fall into three categories: pre-symptomatic, who do not have symptoms when they spread but develop illness a couple of days later; asymptomatic, who never develop symptoms; and post-symptomatic, who get sick and recover but remain contagious.
5:10 CDC officials say they have been researching asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, but the studies are not complete.
Although some asymptomatic infections were discovered, none were found to have spread SARS.
Because symptomatic people were the spreaders, health officials could focus on them to see an outbreak happening and could better isolate infected people and stop the spread.
He cited research showing asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus without realizing it.
More than 4,300 Israelis have been infected with the virus and 15 have died.
China to focus on asymptomatic coronavirus cases after recent rise in infections  The numbers, which are updated at least daily by the provinces and territories, are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as potential cases and people still waiting to learn their test results.
The Public Health Agency of Canada says there is currently no evidence to suggest that any animal native to Canada (wild, livestock or pets) harbours the virus that causes COVID-19, and animals in Canada don't pose a risk of infecting people with the virus.
While the proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, scientists say these \"carriers\" can still pass COVID-19 on to others who do end up getting sick.
(Aly Song/Reuters) As China's domestic outbreak has largely abated, some questioned whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections.

Traces of the virus that causes COVID-19 were also recently discovered on a cruise ship 17 days after infected passengers left.
Respiratory viruses like it are generally transmitted by droplets sprayed out when an infected person sneezes, coughs or, sometimes, just when they talk.
Those droplets can either land directly on surfaces or be transmitted to surfaces like doorknobs if touched by an infected person, some of whom show no symptoms.
However, the amount of viable virus fell much more quickly than that, and generally, you need to be exposed to a certain \"dose\" before you can become infected.
That said, sometimes only small amounts of a virus are needed to infect a host.
You may have read about a recent study that found traces of the virus on surfaces on a cruise ship 17 days after infected passengers left.
However, the researchers note those traces were just genetic material — not live virus — and said that doesn't mean the virus was transmitted via those surfaces.
Another study that used a virus that does not infect humans found that 65 per cent of the virus could be transferred to uncontaminated hands and 34 per cent could be transferred to the mouth.

Airlift departs Wuhan to repatriate Canadians from China's coronavirus zone Planes of foreigners leave China as coronavirus death toll rises, infection spreads Authorities are racing to increase the number of beds in Wuhan and the rest of hard-hit Hubei province, where the health care system has been so overwhelmed that some sick people have been turned away from hospitals and sent home, raising the risk of their spreading the virus to others.
Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contacts, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.
Meanwhile, a Chinese woman suspected of spreading the virus asymptomatically while in Germany for a business meeting on Jan. 20 was determined, in fact, to be exhibiting symptoms.
In Canada, Ontario has one confirmed case of the virus, with 19 people under investigation for possible infection, while B.C. health officials have reported one presumed case.
A man in his 40s — who was earlier presumed to have contracted the virus — was confirmed to be infected after testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
It's a scenario that critical care physician Dr. Rob Fowler predicts could emerge, because he says the virus will probably cause different rates of infection in different parts of the country.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said the virus has killed 170 people and infected more than 7,700 in that country, with an additional 12,000 suspected cases being looked at.
There is currently no compelling evidence that the virus can be transmitted by an infected person who is asymptomatic, according to Yaffe.
Separately, a Chinese woman suspected of spreading the virus asymptomatically while in Germany for a business meeting on Jan. 20, was determined, in fact, to be exhibiting symptoms.
B.C. passengers living under 'cabin arrest' on quarantined cruise ship Another 20 passengers were previously identified as being infected with the virus.
The risk of this virus getting into Nunavut is small.- Michael Patterson, Nunavut chief medical officer Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife has 24 airborne isolation rooms, but because of current information that the coronavirus is transmitted through droplets, the spokesperson said those rooms may not be needed.
That suggests the new virus isn't well adapted to infect people.
Seventeen people have died so far worldwide from the virus and hundreds more have been infected, with one confirmed case in Seattle.
The virus has killed at least 106 people and infected more than 2,750 others, Chinese officials report.
Virus has killed 132 people and infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad.
Several countries have begun moving their citizens out of the Chinese city hardest-hit by an outbreak of a new virus that has killed 132 people and infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad.
The sharp rise in infections recently suggests significant human-to-human spread of the virus, though it could also be explained by expanded monitoring efforts, said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong.
In a post on the university's website he noted some coronaviruses can specifically infect animals and those viruses can jump to humans and cause new infections, such as SARS.
The data appears to indicate a common source in December, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the virus was transmitted from a still-unknown animal to humans at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.
The virus then seemed to adapt to transmit more efficiently between humans.
The new cases bring Japan's total to 203 people infected by the the new virus, COVID-19.
\"Any report of a person with coronavirus here will be very disastrous.\" The virus has killed more than 720 people and infected over 34,500 since late December, with most cases being reported in China.
Don't panic An infection control epidemiologist worries panic and fear might have even worse effects on New Brunswickers than the COVID-19 virus itself.
The new coronavirus: Symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you think you're infected  The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.
The majority of those infections have been inside China, where the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although there have been confirmed cases reported in Shanghai and Beijing, along with Hong Kong and Macao.
It's unclear how easily the virus is transmitted between people.
\"There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.\"  Canada's 1st 'presumptive' case of coronavirus found in Toronto McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.
\"There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.\"  Canada's 1st 'presumptive' case of coronavirus found in Toronto McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.
Health officials have stressed that while human-to-human transmission of the virus does take place, it's most likely in cases involving close, prolonged contact with someone who is already infected.
0:55 According to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others by air through coughing or sneezing, close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, or by touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.
While Canada grapples with a number of infected patients that could potentially rise, Chinese health commission officials said the number of deaths from the virus in Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — has climbed to 76, with four deaths elsewhere in the country, including one in Beijing, and several thousand others infected.
A man in his 40s — who was earlier presumed to have contracted the virus — was confirmed to be infected after testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
She says it's very unlikely that people will transmit the virus before they have symptoms.
Planes of foreigners leave China as coronavirus death toll rises, infection spreadsCanada prepares charter flight to bring home Canadians in ChinaAir Canada suspends all flights to Beijing and Shanghai amid coronavirus outbreak The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips.
\"Somebody who doesn't know that they're exposed and is not symptomatic, looks and feels great, may already be shedding virus to their neighbours,\" she said.
Health officials think the new virus spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.
19 in Ontario being investigated for coronavirus after 1 case confirmed, 1 presumedToronto Public Health says it's ready for infectious diseases like coronavirus Tam said the latest scientific data suggests that people transmit the virus when they're in close contact with others.
Before that, they may conduct virus studies to check that he is no longer contagious.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The virus, which originated in China's Wuhan region, has infected 258 and killed six as of Jan. 21.
Officials say the virus is not considered highly contagious.
\"It looks like this virus is less severe than MERS and SARS, which is a good thing,\" McGeer said of other coronavirus infections, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
In many cases, an epicurve follows a bell curve, steadily rising to a peak and then declining as the outbreak burns out when the virus runs out of susceptible people to infect.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Though some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, there is still little known about it, including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.
\"That means the virus could be transmitted quite easily, from people with mild illness, and that's something we're also learning.''
Here are some basic facts about the virus, its symptoms, prevention and what to do if you think you're infected.
The cluster of infections had raised fears of a potential epidemic after China said last week that the virus causing it was a previously unknown type but came from the same family of viruses that caused the SARS and MERS epidemics.
\"At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.\" The WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the \"coronavirus\" family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak.
Second OpinionIs Canada at risk from a mysterious Chinese virus related to SARS?China reports 1st death from 'new type of coronavirus' Among 41 people confirmed as infected with the new viral pneumonia, one — a 61-year-old man with serious underlying medical conditions — died last week.
Most infections have been confined to China, but other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran are battling to contain the virus.
0:56 The British government declared the virus a \"serious and imminent threat to public health,\" which it said gives authorities powers to forcibly detain infected people if necessary.
Horacio Arruda says there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Quebec, and the chances of it being transmitted to the community are considered low.
By then evolutionary biologist Trevor Bedford had already used the growing database of viral genomes to conclude this virus made the leap from animals to humans sometime in mid-November, an astonishingly precise estimate that helped scientists understand how long the virus had been infecting people.
Evolutionary biologist Trevor Bedford used the growing database of viral genomes to conclude the coronavirus made the leap from animals to humans sometime in mid-November, an astonishingly precise estimate that helped scientists understand how long the virus had been infecting people. (
Robert Hood/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) That data is allowing Bedford to watch the virus mutate in real time, making it possible to identify how people became infected and which cases are linked.
At the time, the Public Health Agency of Canada asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks.
When you have the virus in droplets that get into the air, and other people breathe them in or contact them, that's how this virus is transmitted.
The Science article quotes one author, Michael Hoelscher of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Medical Centre, who said the information about the asymptomatic visitor came from the infected German patients.
\"Many of us were open-minded about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, but also many of us believe that it's just more likely that symptomatic people would be transmitting the infection,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto's University Health Network.
The UN agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads.
(Submitted by Tonia Grandy) The crushing financial pressure is one factor this season; the other is the constant worry about the spread of a highly contagious virus among crew, family and community.
John Einarson/CBC) Window visits have been a common sight at care homes across Canada and around the world, but some nursing homes, including in Nova Scotia and Ottawa, have banned window visitors in hopes of limiting infections and keeping the virus out.
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug, which means it doesn't prevent infection, but it makes it more difficult for the virus to reproduce and spread through the body.
The virus that causes COVID-19 has infected more than 41,000 Michigan residents and contributed to the deaths of 3,789, many in the Detroit area.
Coronaviruses are a cause of the common cold but can also be the cause of more severe illnesses (Beth Fischer/Canadian Press) Last week, WHO urged countries to consider molecular tests for the virus if someone has unexplained pneumonia or a severe respiratory infection that doesn't respond to treatment, particularly if the patient has recently travelled or come from affected countries.
Without a blood test to detect antibodies to the virus, cases can only be reliably determined using sophisticated and rapid diagnostic capabilities that may not be widely accessible in more resource-limited areas of the world such as South Asia.
\"You really have to look for the key features that would suggest they're at risk for this particular virus and right now that's travel to an area where someone has been infected or attached to a cluster of the infections.\" Hatchette and Khan agreed Canadians should not be alarmed.
In Europe, where over 132,000 people with the virus have died, the fear of renewed infection spikes that could again overwhelm hospital emergency wards was tempering hopes that economies on life-support will regain their vigour as workers return to factories, shops and offices.
While we continue to see new cases and expect to as long as the virus is around, we've achieved our primary goal of flattening the curve of infections to keep our health-care system from being overwhelmed,​​​​​.- Alberta Premier Jason Kenney \"While we continue to see new cases and expect to as long as the virus is around, we've achieved our primary goal of flattening the curve of infections to keep our health-care system from being overwhelmed,\" Kenney said.
Originally, the MERS coronavirus appears to have been transmitted somehow to humans in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates who didn't catch the infection from other people.
The statement called for urgent investigations to find the source of the virus and how it is infecting people.
Learn how the WHO is tracking this new virus  \"I'm not sure that there's an easy way to get at this information unless it's more forthcoming from within Saudi Arabia or any of the partners that are working with Saudi Arabia inside the country.\" To date, the WHO has been notified of 40 confirmed infections with the virus, which has been recently named MERS, for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
The lab's research priorities for the virus include:  Developing important diagnostic tests, including a test to detect antibodies against the virus, which will allow researchers to determine with greater accuracy if someone has been exposed to the virus.
\"The virus is only there for a short period of time so you can't really tell whether somebody had a past infection or not whereas antibodies allow you to do that,\" said Dr. Frank Plummer, the scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory.
(Health Protection Agency/Associated Press) Infections with the new virus have popped up in several Middle Eastern countries and in Britain, though that cluster of three cases appears to have been set off when a man who lives in Britain became ill while travelling in Saudi Arabia.
That information that is needed to assess whether the infections were sporadic jumps of the virus from its reservoir in nature or whether the virus passed person to person in some or all of these cases.
It was a lab at Erasmus MC, a medical centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands that sent a Saudi sample of the virus to Winnipeg, where scientists are looking for better ways to diagnose and treat the infection.
Chief among the questions include how humans become infected, where the virus originated and how it spreads.
\"The virus is capable of infecting human, pig and bat cells,\" Christian Drosten of the University of Bonn Medical Centre and co-authors concluded.
\"Our results implicate that the new virus might use a receptor that is conserved between bats, pigs and humans suggesting a low barrier against cross-host transmission.\" Scientists are watching for signs of \"cross-host transmission\" because if the virus is able to infect cells from a range of species then it might be able to pass easily between animals and humans repeatedly.
\"It's completely unusual for any coronavirus to be able to do that — to go back to its original reservoir.\" The virus's ability to infect multiple species in the lab might suggest that the human cases were infected by animal sources rather than people, Drosten noted.
The new coronavirus can easily infect the cells of the airways of the human lung and in fact is as adept at doing so as a common cold virus, a new study reports.
Thiel said the team was not surprised that the new virus could infect the airway cells — called epithelial cells — because it has already infected people.
As well, testing on stored samples revealed two people who died in a mysterious respiratory outbreak in Jordan last April were infected with the EMC virus.
That finding opens up the possibility that interferons, which are currently used in the treatment of some viral diseases, could be used to treat infection with the EMC virus, Thiel said.
\"Whether they made a mistake or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose.\" Spies investigate Wuhan lab The intel statement said the federal agencies concur \"with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified.\" \"The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" WATCH | Wuhan's COVID-19 death toll at least 50 per cent more than previously reported: Beijing concedes that the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in China is even higher than originally announced.
Kristian Andersen, who studies the virus at Scripps Research in La Jolla, Calif., puts the odds of it being accidentally released by the Wuhan lab at \"a million to one,\" far less likely than an infection in nature.
According to the provincial health officer, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control is currently looking at 17 of these tests, which would determine if people who were not previously identified as COVID-19 patients have developed antibodies to the virus.
Those protocols will include a random sampling of people across the province to estimate infection rates, targeted testing to find links between disease clusters in the community, and testing of previously collected blood samples to see if anyone already had antibodies to the coronavirus before the outbreak in B.C.
They] were coughing and had a fever.\" She says any pet that was infected should be isolated from other pets to prevent the virus from spreading.
\"As a part of outbreak management, we have implemented testing of all contacts, both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, at the centres that are affected.
Because the virus is transmitted person-to-person, health authorities have closed beaches, boat launches and most marinas to reduce the rate of new COVID-19 cases by preventing crowds from gathering in recreation areas.
While we know animals can become infected — even a tiger in a New York City zoo tested positive for the virus — Dr. Rebecca Archer, a clinical instructor of small animal medicine with the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Calgary, has said there is no evidence so far that we can catch the coronavirus from our pets.
Respiratory viruses like the coronavirus are typically transmitted by touching your face or breathing in droplets that an infected person has just breathed out.
It is conducting an investigation to determine if Tessier was infected by the virus at work.
Conway says both are a possibility, since so much is still unknown about how the virus works and whether recovered patients have sufficient antibodies to give them some immunity.
\"If precautions are not taken, one person infected with this virus can spread it to hundreds of others,\" said Ford.
In some cases, public health officials have found interviewees have not properly been adhering to the restrictions, choosing to get together thinking doing so might be \"benign.\" Williams added that 50 to 60 per cent of new confirmed cases each day are people not in long-term care or other institutional settings, suggesting the virus continues to infect people at the community level.
Directed by the Carlos III Health Institute, it aims to test 36,000 families for the presence of antibodies generated to fight off the virus.
She died before a second test could be given, and health officials haven't yet confirmed whether she was infected with the virus 'Battle is not won' in Montreal A masked pedestrian walks past John Seward Johnson II's similarly attired sculpture, Catching Up, on Sherbrooke Street in Westmount. (
She said there can be pre-symptomatic spread, meaning people can infect others three days before showing symptoms, and asymptomatic spread, where people have the virus and can spread it but don't show any symptoms.
Dr. Jayabarathan believes the risk of transmitting the virus to someone else is going to be present for some time to come.
Calculated that with the rate of infection, the population of Newfoundland, the places I'd been over the last couple of weeks, that regrettable night on George Street and the cat drinking out of the water glass on my night table there was a 143 per cent chance I had already contracted the virus and died.
We paint that virus with proteins that come from the virus which is causing the pandemic in the first place, and so it basically vaccinates the person and makes them think they're infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, but they're not.
It goes in there and convinces the immune system that [the body] is being infected with a more potent virus.
Buttigieg said antibody tests are a simple way to evaluate if his theory that most people in Saskatchewan have already had the virus is correct.
Antibody blood tests detect the presence of antibodies that form in the wake of an infection and can help identify who has had the virus and recovered.
Read the full story: www.cbc.ca/1.5541748 1:28 'Wishful thinking' Experts consulted by CBC agreed that if 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the population had COVID-19 antibodies, that should stop the virus from spreading as widely or as quickly.
\"We expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection.
Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's chief medial officer, says the province is working on a plan to run antibody tests to determine how widespread the coronavirus infection is.
\"The hypothesis that I am sticking with is that about 200,000 people in the province would have already been exposed to this virus and are probably carrying the antibodies for it.\"  Muhajarine said that even in that case, physical distancing would still be required because the province would be nowhere near herd immunity.
A technician collects a person's blood at a drive-thru coronavirus testing site in Hempstead, N.Y. Experts agree that antibody testing is critical for understanding how many people were actually infected with the virus. (
\"As we were learning about this virus, how it was transmitted, about the asymptomatics, it was already raging in New York.\" Travellers wearing protective gear walk through New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on April 16 as it stands mostly empty due to the ongoing cutbacks in travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (
WATCH | An epidemiologist explains why masks are effective for asymptomatic carriers 'The point of the mask,' says Christopher Labos, 'is to protect others from you,' especially if you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus.
Yes, he says, \"there's no direct evidence that masks can prevent transmission.\"  \"But there's no direct evidence that hand-washing can prevent the transmission of COVID or lockdowns can prevent the transmission of COVID because none of those trials have ever been done in the context of COVID.\"  One infectious disease expert says WHO's recommendation on masks doesn't take into account the significant number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus in the general population.
(Evan Mitsui/CBC) Javid said there is a \"logical gap\" in WHO's recommendation, because it doesn't take into account the significant number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus in the general population, also known as \"silent spreaders.\"  Asymptomatic carriers are those who show no symptoms, while pre-symptomatic carriers are people who have not yet displayed symptoms — usually in the first few days of infection.
Research on virus's spread suggests masks could help Emerging research has revealed more about how the virus spreads from person to person, suggesting it doesn't just transmit through coughing but also through simply talking.
Emerging research has revealed more about how the virus spreads from person to person, suggesting it doesn't just transmit through coughing but also through simply talking. (
\"Masks really could help make a difference because they will — if you are sick without knowing it — block those droplets from flying into the air and then staying in the air or contaminating surfaces.\"  A paper by researchers in China set to be published in July in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, found an infected individual without symptoms was apparently able to spread the virus to nine others at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China.
The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers.
(Ben Nelms/CBC) But some experts say that given that significant role asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus play in the spread of the virus, Canada should be mandating the use of non-medical masks in public, the way other countries have.
Thirty-seven people infected with the virus have died.
OpinionAs civil liberties erode, Canada must not allow COVID-19 outbreak to infect the rule of lawNewFar-right groups may try to take advantage of pandemic, watchdogs warn At least 11 countries have adopted similar uses of digital and other technologies to track and defeat this virus, some more extreme than others.
Israel has followed suit by passing an emergency law to allow mobile phone tracking of those infected with the virus, and community tracking of all those who were likely in contact with them, in order to identify and impose mandatory quarantine on people most likely to expand the community transmission of the disease.
According to Jeff Wilkins, president of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers, COVID-19 appears to have been inadvertently spread through the facility by an infected employee who caught the virus through community transmission, sometime between March 9 and 14.
The Canadian Press) Williams reiterated that in a press conference, noting the social contacts of those infected must also be traced and contained if we're ever to bring the virus to heel.
That's because by the time you've identified people who have the virus, their close contacts may already be infected and spreading it to others.
\"Those antibodies are what physically do the protecting,\" he says, adding that when your body comes in contact with these weakened pathogens, it thinks you've been infected, even though you haven't.
That means, antibodies you created to fight off the virus the first time you are exposed may not be effective the next time.
SickKids says it is investigating how the virus was transmitted, along with Toronto Public Health.
More than 24,450 people have died of the virus in the United States overall, with 584,000 confirmed infections, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.
We need to reboot B.C. without rebooting the virus' While British Columbians are starting to think about how society might slowly open up if the province continues to flatten the curve of infection, Henry said everyone needs to be very careful about how that happens.
So-called serology tests measure the amount of antibodies that appear in the blood after someone has battled an infection — including those who don't even know they had COVID-19 because they didn't meet testing criteria, didn't seek care or had mild or no symptoms.
This data is important for policy makers deciding when to ease restrictions, says epidemiologist Patrick Saunders-Hastings, director of life sciences and environmental health at Gevity Consulting Inc. Without it, our picture of COVID-19's spread in Canada remains incomplete — diagnostic laboratory tests now in use largely focus on high-risk groups and only capture people actively infected with the virus.
5:27 Estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic infections vary widely, but he says most experts believe it is somewhere between one-quarter and half of all cases.
He says it's 97 per cent accurate when compared to laboratory PCR methods but is meant to be used in conjunction with a lab test to rule out the possibility a person still has the virus and could infect others.
\"We know that this virus can infect a range of species, or at least it appears that way.
The theory is those bats transmitted the virus to another species, where it evolved into the micro-organism that has so far killed more than 100,000 people and sickened nearly two million.
Extremely painful': Passengers on repatriation flights from India describe disorganized booking process Officials have also not disclosed how many health workers have been infected even amid reports of doctors and nurses contracting the virus and some dying from it, and at least one private hospital having to be sealed off because of an outbreak among staff.
The four-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia — and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill — are believed to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo employee, the zoo said.
Scientists say they hope an accurate and rapid blood test will be developed eventually to look for COVID-19 antibodies — helping to identify people who have had the virus (even if they were never tested when they had it) and determining if those people are now immune, at least in the short term.
\"Imagine a virus that takes 14 days where you may or may not be contagious.
I do believe that there's a more substantial portion of asymptomatic people who can transmit than we initially thought.
One thing we still don't know is exactly how many people's exposure to the virus was traced back to an event or larger mass gathering, as that sub-category is broadly grouped together with people who became infected by a household contact.
Outbreaks have also been declared at Sisters of St Joseph and St. Joseph's Hospice, where at least 12 staff and six residents had been infected with the virus.
At the time, officials said they were unsure about how the virus entered the facility, but health authorities later said a patient infected with the virus had entered the facility.
In Turkmenistan, it is illegal to even mention the virus and the government has insisted it has no infections, despite hundreds of cases in surrounding nations.
Respiratory viruses like coronaviruses are typically transmitted by droplets sprayed out when an infected person sneezes, coughs or, sometimes, just when they talk.
Those droplets can either land directly on surfaces or be transmitted to surfaces such as doorknobs if touched by an infected person, some of whom show no symptoms.
One thing we still don't know is exactly how many people's exposure to the virus was traced back to an event or larger mass gathering, as that sub-category is broadly grouped together with people who became infected by a household contact.
The University of Manitoba professor told CBC News the odds of getting the virus are directly linked to the length of exposure to someone who's infected.
The virus, which has infected nearly two million people globally, has yet to meet a treatment that can beat it.
\"It has protected antibodies which has helped them fight off the virus and so if you take that plasma from people who have recovered and give it to people who are fighting off the infection  currently in the hospital, it might be able to get them better\" Dr. Arnold, the lead researcher and director of the McMaster Centre for Transfusion Research, said.
Leading infection risk factor \"Shaking hands is absolutely one of the leading risk factors for transmitting or acquiring microbial infection such as COVID-19,\" said Paul Pottinger, an infectious disease professor at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Another case has been confirmed at Mission Institution for a total 76 people infected with the virus to date, including 65 federal inmates.
\"We need to look at automating some of the aspects of this process so we can reduce the time to trace the contacts and therefore optimize our efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\" When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers interview the infected person to determine who they may have come into close contact with during the period when they were contagious.
Smoking increases the risk of poor outcomes from any lung infection, and this virus mainly affects the lungs.
The prospect of people being re-infected with the virus is of international concern, as many countries are hoping that infected populations will develop sufficient immunity to prevent a resurgence of the pandemic.
As the coronavirus pandemic throws millions out of work and devastates economies worldwide, governments are struggling with the delicate balance between keeping people safe from a highly contagious virus and making sure they can still make a living or even have enough to eat.
That means a lot to everybody in the community, saying that we're taking this seriously and we're going to follow what has been set out by our leadership.\"  La Loche mayor Robert St Pierre says the community is working to ensure those who have been infected by the virus have the support and supplies they need. (
St. Pierre said those in the community are rallying around those affected by the virus, noting they've been sending them messages of support over the radio and have been keeping those infected in his prayers.

Face away from others, because if someone sneezes or coughs, you can prevent potentially infected droplets from landing on your face and the mucosal membranes where the virus can get in.
Early experiments have shown cats and ferrets could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, said Weese, and they can transmit that virus to other cats and ferrets.
He said a cat tested positive for COVID-19 in Hong Kong, but didn't get sick, while one infected with the virus in Belgium did.
According to data compiled by CBC News, 177 people have died from the virus province-wide, with more than 4,700 patients infected.
Homemade masks won't protect you against COVID-19 like handwashing, distance: expertsSome health experts questioning advice against wider use of masks to slow spread of COVID-19 Three days later, he tweeted that though there remains \"scant\" evidence that wearing a mask, especially improperly, can protect the wearer, \"emerging data suggests facial coverings may prevent asymptomatic disease transmission to others.\" In Canada, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam recommend that only those who have symptoms or are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection wear masks.
When asked if the close-quarter living conditions of some of the staff who work in the processing plants might have contributed the spread of the virus, Lavoie said \"from a communicable disease perspective\" this can be \"a big challenge.\" Lavoie said the health authority is contacting all poultry processing plants to ensure all have safety measures, partitions and personal protective gear and employee screening in place to catch any infections fast.
\"Those people, who are predominantly women, get up in the morning and they hope by the end of the day that they don't get infected.... They pray that when they come home they don't make [family members] sick, that they're not bringing the virus into the house,\" Stewart said.
\"Our new normal is a normal with COVID in our population and in our province until a vaccine arrives and we need to plan that way.\" The original modelling was based on a basic reproductive rate, or R0, which is the average number of people that one person with the virus could infect,  of 2.4 to 4.0.

THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 27 The real risk is when you're in close contact with individuals who are either asymptomatic or symptomatic.
The short answer is that we need somewhere between probably 60 to 70 per cent of the population to actually be infected [and] recovered and that we presume that if you recover, that you have some degree of protection or full protection against the virus.
The existing test looks for an active virus, but immunity tests look for antibodies in the blood.
U.S. health officials are urging Americans to follow stay-at-home orders until the end of April to contain the spread of the virus, which originated in China and has infected about three-quarters of a million people around the world.
Patients who had never been to the suspected source of the virus, the Huanan Seafood Market, were infected.
They searched for visitors to a market that dealt in live game, believing the virus was largely transmitted from animals to humans.
Record 6.6M Americans filed for jobless benefits last weekGeorgia governor slammed for not knowing asymptomatic people could transmit virus Those family members often suffered from the same medical conditions before becoming sick, leaving them similarly vulnerable to the coronavirus despite their age gaps.
Johnson's fiancée had symptoms Johnson tested positive for the virus on March 26, the first leader of a major power to announce that he had been infected.
All symptomatic staff and residents will now be screened, as well as any asymptomatic residents or staff who came in contact with someone with COVID-19.
'I don't understand why'  Management at the home was not transparent with staff about which residents were infected with the virus, said Reid.
Because being in close quarters can increase the chance of transmitting the virus, Ivan Franko's management team was quick to segregate residents by floor, creating makeshift dining rooms on each level so residents would only interact with those on their floor.
Stewart said that because Eatonville didn't do something similar earlier on, especially after residents became infected with COVID-19, it likely caused the virus to spread more quickly.

Manitoba's chief public health officer says research is underway to determine if serological tests, also known as rapid blood tests, can actually detect the presence of antibodies that may point to a coronavirus infection.
They are instead designed to look for antibodies that have been produced in response to the virus — which signals recent or previous infection.
\"It is our intention to deliver tests to the markets where there is a backlog in demand, and it was our belief Canada was one of those markets.\"  Health Canada says priority is being given to tests that can detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, and not just antibodies a person may have produced in response to it.
This means it is still possible for someone who handles or touches a body infected with the virus to also become infected, says Schwartz.
New research suggests asymptomatic carriers are adding to the spread of the virus.

\"In fact, coronarviruses are quite well understood as far as how they're comprised and how they replicate, but there's still a significant amount of research that needs to go into developing a strategy to routinely make vaccines against them.\" Both branches of the immune system need to be tapped — an antibody-based immune response, in which the body produces antibodies to bind onto the surface of the virus and neutralize it, and the cell-mediated response, which trains the immune system to recognize cells that are infected with the virus so they can be destroyed — he said.
The highly contagious virus that surrounds them on a daily basis informs nearly every decision and every action.
\"Ethically,\" he said, \"there's a reciprocity on the government's end, on society's end, to provide that personal protective equipment to those health-care workers on the front line to protect them when they put themselves in harm's way.\" WATCH | What you need to know about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic: 'The point of the mask,' says Christopher Labos, 'is to protect others from you,' especially if you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus.
The tentative steps toward restarting life run against the warnings of many public health experts, who say the increased human interaction could spark a new wave of cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the highly contagious virus.
\"Although concerning, after all of the precautions and controls that staff have put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, the identification and isolation of asymptomatic people is the best way to protect our residents and staff throughout this crisis,\" Bigger said.

Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19OpinionWe urgently need to start making more masks in Canada - and wearing them One of the key things now is emerging evidence that infected individuals are in fact most infectious and breeding the virus just before they become symptomatic ... that means especially healthier and younger individuals who may be infected could be spreading the virus unknowingly.
I'm nervous.\" Her son has a compromised immune system, and she worries her daughters could bring the virus home and infect him.
Trump called Washington state's governor, who is dealing with the most serious outbreak in the nation, a \"snake.\" He said he'd prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they wouldn't be added to the count for the nation's total number of infections.
False negatives can still be infectious Jenne says people in the early stages of infection can, unfortunately, still transmit the virus, even if they test negative and don't have symptoms.
The total number of people in Ottawa confirmed to have been infected with the virus now sits at 345.
Etches has also said the virus could infect 4,000 people a day at its peak if physical distancing and self-isolation recommendations aren't respected.
COVID-19 continue to grip U.S. The Ford decision comes as the number of people infected by the virus spikes in Michigan.
If they've researched up enough ... I guess I'm not too inclined to worry.- Cole Stevenon, Dearborn, Mich. plant employee, Ford The decisions on whether to reopen factories should be based on local virus transmissions and infections, he said, adding that the number of people infected is going to rise because of additional testing that is now being done.
Martin Stuermer, a biochemist and virus researcher who runs a private testing lab in Frankfurt, said he thinks the true scale of the pandemic in Germany won't become visible until after it's over — when people can be tested for the antibody, a sign that they had, indeed, been infected even if they never developed symptoms.
According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, coronavirus spreads most commonly from an infected person through:   respiratory droplets generated when you cough or sneeze close, prolonged personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands  Current evidence suggests person-to-person spread is can happen when there is close contact.
He has nothing but praise for the facility, but the virus that has infected its residents has him fearing for her safety.
There is also evidence that asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 are helping to drive the spread of the virus.
\"We need to have an indication of how prevalent has the virus been because a lot of people might have had this without showing symptoms and their only real way to know is to do this very simple blood test to see if we have antibodies for them the for the virus.\" Olla said Crest Mold Technology Inc. and Integrity Tool and Mold Inc., both in Tecumseh, are working with Audacia Bioscience to create the plastic for the devices.
With a few drops of blood, Olla said his test can show if your body has \"some\" protection against the virus because your body has created some antibodies against the virus.
Trump was joined by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, virus task force co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's foremost infection disease expert.
Unnerving stories Now, like many of his colleagues, he's grown acutely aware of the risks borne by front-line workers treating highly contagious patients amid uncertainty over personal protective equipment levels and unnerving stories of hospital staff being infected — and dying — abroad.
On very rare occasions, humans will transmit that virus from one person to another, which is what occurred with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and, by all indications, is happening with COVID-19.
Resources may not be available to support visitors who become ill while they're away or for those who live in small towns if the virus is transmitted.
Vera Etches said the virus could infect 4,000 people a day at its peak if physical distancing and self-isolation recommendations aren't respected.
\"They are overworked, underpaid, exhausted and they have to take on two or three different jobs to make a living and perhaps transmitting this virus from one home to another,\" said Silcox.
\"While we're going to continue to try and contain this virus and try and limit its spread, we are concerned that we are moving to that next phase in terms of where it's at.\" Calling the city's first \"community transmission\" Richardson explained the case means the more than 200 city staff members focused on contact tracing could not link the infected person to any recent travel.
After his diagnosis, he said he realized he had never really expected to get infected despite his occupation — and never expected the guilt he would feel about exposing his family to the virus, nor the stigma it bears.
These tests cannot detect early infections because the body's immune system hasn't had time to produce antibodies against the virus.
BTNX Inc.) The test kit sells for about $10 US and it uses a simple finger-prick of blood to reveal whether someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The company reports that the test is highly sensitive and specific for the COVID-19 virus, but does not recommend it as stand-alone confirmation of an infection, and the test can be complicated if a person has been infected by milder coronavirus strains.
\"We want the general public to understand that the only way to protect our health care providers, ourselves and our families is to comply with the social distancing requirements mandated by the Government of Saskatchewan.\"   COVID-19 in Sask: Premier threatens international travellers who don't self-isolate with arrest, fines   The government's leaked COVID-19 document included stark estimates about the virus' potential effect, including anywhere between 9,000 and 15,000 deaths, based on an assumption of about 30 per cent of the province's population becoming infected.
Horgan promises to investigate sick pay changes following poultry plant outbreak Outbreak at 2nd poultry plant Another poultry plant is seeing staff infected with the virus.

Potential for 'rapid spread' behind bars But Sen. Kim Pate, an advocate for prison reform who has been pushing for the release of some offenders during the pandemic, said banning visits and locking down prisons with infections will not work because asymptomatic staff coming and going to work can still carry the virus, and the spread can occur \"extremely rapidly\" in closed environments without adequate health care.
The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers.
Many people have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections.
If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.\" That advice is contradicted by the World Health Organization, the government of Canada and federal public health officials like Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam.
A 2015 randomized clinical trial found that cloth masks, for example, did not block influenza and respiratory viruses and actually increased the rate of infections among health care workers compared to those who wore surgical masks, and even surgical masks blocked only slightly more than half of virus particles.
There are also infected people who don't show symptoms but can still shed the virus, known as asymptomatic spreaders.
\"Larger facilities have more ability to isolate to a wing or separate building; unlike Pinecrest.\" Virus 'a different beast' Stephen Oldridge, one of two attending physicians at Pinecrest and the former medical director at the home, said with what is now known about COVID-19, there should have been a greater attempt to separate residents who were asymptomatic with those who were sick.
There are also infected people who don't show symptoms but can still shed the virus, known as asymptomatic spreaders.
11:05 Urging mask use at all times Based on fresh evidence from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control about asymptomatic transmission of the virus, Sinha is urging the province to further ramp up testing of nursing home residents and is recommending that long-term care staff wear masks at all times.
The idea is that once enough people have been infected and develop antibodies, the virus will no longer be able to spread widely.
Many people have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, and if they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others,\" said George Gao, the centre's director, in a recent Science article.
Canada's chief science officer Mona Nemer said today that serology testing checks for the antibodies that are generated in response to an infection — and can tell physicians who has been infected without knowing it.
\"Other important information that we're still missing is how quickly the virus changes or mutates to escape detection and whether certain individuals are more susceptible to infection or less able to overcome it.\" Today's measures support previous efforts by the Trudeau government to marshal Canada's scientific community in the battle against COVID-19.
The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed upwards of 5,600 globally, including one person in British Columbia.
COVID-19 in Sask: 6 more health care workers infected with virus, top doc says   The health care worker training for COVID-19 intubation had some advice too.
\"This is important as it helps contain the virus to a group of closely linked individuals and reduces the likelihood of spread in the community.\" Public health nurses are working with the person to determine who else might have been exposed when the individual was infectious and potentially transmitting the virus, and are following-up with those people as well, stated the TBDHU.
One of the ways is that the virus mutates into something that's less serious for us, so less infective, meaning it can't go back and forth between humans and causes less severe disease — probably more of a common cold.
Right now, COVID-19 appears to be transmitted mainly by symptomatic patients in close contact with other people.
43:57 \"This virus has spread almost exclusively through close contact with infected individuals who are showing symptoms — usually cough, fever and other respiratory symptoms —so we can protect ourselves by limiting close prolonged contact with other individuals.
\"Children perhaps have some immunity right now because they are continuously infected by viruses including other coronaviruses, so perhaps their immune systems are more prepared and have an immunity to other coronaviruses,\" Freedman said.
The virus has infected 80,000 globally and recently spread to Iran, where there have been 139 confirmed cases and 19 deaths, according to state television.
Watch an infection control specialist who says WHO is dragging its feet on calling COVID-19 a pandemic: Dr. Michael Gardam of Toronto's Humber River Hospital says we all need to get ready for the virus gaining a foothold in Canada.

\"If you are considering March Break travel, and you are going on trips, part of that is when you are doing your precautionary assessment.\" To travel or not to travel: Only go if it's essential, says infectious disease expertThe COVID-19 pandemic: What it is, who's at risk, and how you can protect yourselfWhat the decision to call the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic means for Canada and the world Health officials have been reminding people to practise good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing and to stay home if sick to avoid infection and those actions need to continue to protect the most vulnerable people from the virus, he said.
The virus has infected and killed thousands already and is expected to get worse in Canada and the United States in the weeks to come.
\"Good antibody testing showing immunity or a vaccine would change those [phased return] plans dramatically.\"  You can watch more of Dr. Michael Curry's answers on The National here: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including if there’s any way of knowing how many asymptomatic people could be walking around when only symptomatic people are being tested.
Here's what we know: A COVID-19 infection occurs when droplets containing the virus make contact with a mucosal membrane — the soft linings on our eyes, nose, mouth and elsewhere — including in the inner lining of our middle ears, which connects to the nose and mouth.
The virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its DNA when it replicates and infects a host, she said.
\"There's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus.
The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.
When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack — and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus.
Asymptomatic patients, who show no symptoms but can still pass the virus to others, have become China's chief concern after strict containment measures succeeded in cutting the overall infection rate.
While there are no known virus infections among the museum's 2,300 workers, \"it's only a question of time,\" he said.
They filter out the microdroplets that transmit the highly contagious virus when someone with it sneezes, coughs or even speaks.
The ministry said it has registered its first case of local transmission within the country, whereas previous infections were among people who contracted the virus abroad and then travelled to Brazil.
Fisman believes that is too restrictive because the virus is now being transmitted within the province.
\"My concern was that with this virus on the go it would be easily transmitted without proper facilities provided to travellers for cleanliness.
Once the virus is transmitted within a community, that's when experts can more accurately simulate the numbers.
That's because it's estimated each carrier of the virus infects an average of two to three people, Tuite noted, so it becomes a matter of simple exponential math.
\"We know the virus can be shared with individuals that are not symptomatic, so the fact that you don't have a temperature doesn't mean that you are free and clear,\" she said.
Why it's different in every country \"We need to scale up testing of whether someone has this virus,\" he said, \"but also whether someone had the virus and whether they've developed immunity.\"  Hoffman said serological testing — blood testing that can detect if someone has been infected and detect antibodies — is the next key factor in determining the true spread of COVID-19 and developing an effective treatment.
Some basic facts about the virus, its symptoms, prevention and what to do if you believe you are infected can be found here.
Probably not, but there is some evidence that people can get infected with this virus and not show any symptoms.
As well, there is mounting evidence that those who are asymptomatic coronavirus carriers are playing a key part in spreading the virus around the globe.
The thread caused some concern &amp; we would like to clarify:<br><br>We expect that most people who are infected with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection.
Classes have been cancelled since March 15 to prevent the spread of the virus that causes potentially fatal COVID-19 infections.
It could even be here now, hosted by a presymptomatic or asymptomatic carrier able to spread the virus without knowing it.
Dr. Brent Roussin, the province's chief provincial public health officer, said the strategies are based on how the virus gets transmitted.
What Manitobans need to know about COVID-19 \"This virus, in the community setting, is almost exclusively transmitted through those who have symptoms, and through close contact with those who have symptoms,\" Roussin said on March 13.
These measures are different from standard flu precautions like washing your hands, but they're all based on the way scientists believe the virus is transmitted: through large droplets of mucus or saliva that carry it from the respiratory tract of an infected person into the respiratory tract of someone else.
\"We don't have that sort of strength of randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,\" he said, but the recommended techniques are based on \"accumulated decades of research, looking at transmission of various viruses or infections in different … limited populations, and extrapolation to what seems to make sense.\"  We still see people coughing into their hands, which makes me think that people don't really understand.- Dr. Annalee Yassi, UBC Dr. Annalee Yassi, a professor and Canada Research Chair at the school of population and public health at the University of British Columbia, said the behaviour of the new coronavirus so far also supports scientists' beliefs about how it works.

Doctors don't necessarily need to know whether a person is infected with the virus to begin treatment for COVID-19. (
Annick Sauvé/Radio-Canada) Eastern Townships director of public health Alain Poirier said his team has been working on what he calls the \"algorithm of contamination,\" speaking with everyone with whom an infected person has come into contact to figure out where they got the virus.
The decision showed the growing worry across the Mideast about the virus as Iran confirmed that infected cases in the country spiked by over 100, to 254 now.
There is also evidence that asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 are helping to drive the spread of the virus.
You too can get a COVID-19 test in the N.W.T. \"A vaccine is for protection against future infection of a virus, but there isn't a cure for coronavirus at this point,\" Cook said.
WHO said China's experience shows aggressive early measures can prevent the virus from gaining a foothold, and there hasn't been widespread community transmission — the spread from one person to another when there was no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with an infected individual.
Not all fevers need to be treated If you do have the virus, it may be helpful to consider that fever is part of the body's natural defences against infection.
(CBC) When asked about antibody testing — which is used to find out who may have already been infected with COVID-19, in order to learn more about how the virus spreads in the community — Roussin says it's something the province is looking into.
There is also evidence that asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 are helping to drive the spread of the virus.
\"When I plotted how the virus was being transmitted, I saw that it was from close contact.
When detailed data on each new COVID-19 case was released by the B.C. government, it was possible to trace how the virus was transmitted. (
In some cases, they release how new infections are linked to others and how the virus is mutating as it hops borders.
Data details slim as cases grow Baniassad is no longer able to trace how the virus is being transmitted in B.C. The data put out by the British Columbia government was detailed in the first few days but as the numbers grow, it's down to the bare essentials: number of new daily cases, deaths and recoveries.
Public health officials say a man in his 50s and a man in his 60s have contracted the virus, but details have not yet been released regarding how the men were infected or whether they're in hospital or self-isolation.
\"If we do determine that she was working when she was capable of transmitting the virus, then we will be contacting people directly that are close contacts and taking whatever steps are necessary to communicate with people that may have been exposed,\" she added.
Staff infected at 2 care homes In Langley and Surrey, residents at two long-term care homes are being monitored for COVID-19 symptoms after two staff members tested positive for the virus.

The steps Canada has taken to curb the spread of this virus may be \"flattening the curve,\" but we cannot forget that the vast majority of our population will continue to be susceptible to infection in the absence of measures that:  Reduce the proportion of Canadians who are susceptible (a vaccine) Reliably tell us who is no longer susceptible (an antibody test) Effectively treat illness caused by COVID-19 (drugs) Interrupt transmission chains (widespread contact tracing)  Until an effective combination of these measures becomes possible, or the virus simply stops circulating in this part of the world, Canadians must resist drawing the conclusion that we can lower our guard.
3:25 Despite the fact that the majority of Canadians remain susceptible to this virus, the good news is that we have bought ourselves time — time to prepare our health care system to handle a major surge in demand, and to start ramping up our supply chain in case a bigger wave of infections does hit.
Many communities lack sewers and running water, putting people at greater risk of getting sick from COVID-19, the respiratory disease linked to the virus, the council said this week, noting there is already a high prevalence of tuberculosis and other respiratory infections in those communities.
There is also evidence that asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 are helping to drive the spread of the virus.

The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it.
Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs.
For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted.

\"You don't know where the virus is at any particular moment in time, and now what you have is basically the potential for that person to pass it on to a much larger group of people.\" Kindrachuk said community transmission is particularly challenging because the virus doesn't produce symptoms in everyone it infects.
\"If everyone just does their best to maintain their distance from everyone else, and stop meeting anyone outside of your household, then that should do the job.\" Kindrachuk said that while there are severe cases of COVID-19, the \"vast majority\" of infected people experience mild or moderate respiratory symptoms and can even spread the virus before developing symptoms.
\"For every one case we identify, there are probably quite a few other cases that have not been identified and that are able to transmit virus readily in our communities,\" he said.
Pause sweat lodges and pipe ceremonies, restrict contact to stop COVID-19, say Indigenous doctors Van der Woerd says in the past Indigenous people endured outbreaks of other viruses and did everything they could to curtail infection, but lost hundreds of thousands of people.
1:49 St. Joseph's Lifecare Centre currently has a COVID-19 outbreak designation; a casually employed staff member contracted the virus in the community and was working in the home while asymptomatic.
\"One of the key strategies in being able to contain this virus is being able to identify individuals that may be infected with this virus.
\"We're only going to detect that first person that's infected with the virus by testing.\" With March break around the corner Harvey said it's important residents pay close attention to travel advisories.

According to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic.
Alan Santos/Brazil's Presidential Press Office via AP) (Alan Santo's/Brazil's Presidential Press Office/Associated Press) Eric Morrissette of Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, told CBC News in an email that testing asymptomatic people can create \"a false sense of reassurance.\" \"An asymptomatic individual who tests negative could still go on to become symptomatic and develop the disease within the incubation period,\" he wrote.
\"Monitoring an asymptomatic individual who is a contact of someone with COVID-19 and recommending 14-day self-isolation does more to prevent the spread of the virus than a potentially false negative test result.\" Trump, Pence not being tested U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence sparked headlines in the U.S. when the White House indicated that neither would be tested after recently being in close contact with Brazil's Communications Director Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the disease.
\"It's more direct contact with people and then the virus being on what we call a high-touch surface ... that people then get on their hands and then infect themselves.\" It's possible for a respiratory virus like COVID-19 to remain on a surface for a number of days, Strang said.
He said once people are exposed to a specific strain of a virus or bacterial infection, they usually develop an immunity to it.
AbCellera is using high-powered computers, artificial intelligence and advanced lab technology to scan blood samples of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, and find antibodies from them that could be used in the treatment and prevention of the virus.
Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to foreign substances like viruses or bacteria in the body.
Discovering an antibody that binds to the COVID-19 virus could lead to a possible anti-viral treatment.
However, the study found the amount of virus that is found on the surfaces might not be enough to get infected and further research is needed.
Based on early clinical trials, there is no evidence to suggest transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her fetus.
While there have been reported cases of newborns with the virus, it's likely those were a result of intimate contact with an infected mother.

Top stories today  The University of British Columbia says a team led by Dr. Josef Penninger has found a potential drug that helps block infection from the virus that causes COVID-19.
\"Once it gets inside of our cell, it releases its genomic material and then it uses basically our host cell machinery to create more and more and more copies of itself.\"  As proof that the cause of the global pandemic is not debris, Kindracuk points to various scientific investigations into the coronavirus, including the fact researchers have been able to take it apart physically and put the virus sequence back together and use it to infect primates.
He also claims that the Boston health department tried to experiment with the 1918 flu virus by purposefully infecting healthy people with the mucus of infected patients, and that the result was that the healthy people didn't get sick.
However, the study found the amount of virus that is found on the surfaces might not be enough to get infected and further research is needed.
\"Evidence has shown that the disease has been transmitted through the respiratory tract and there is the possibility of viral mutation.\" The illness comes from a newly identified type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people.
\"There is tons of evidence that this virus is in the saliva and the throats of potentially asymptomatic people,\" said Gray.
That people are dreaming of these things is no surprise given the anxiety caused by a new, contagious virus and the unprecedented social response to its spread, one expert says.
It's not believed to be anywhere near as accurate when it comes to testing asymptomatic people, who may not shed the virus at similarly high levels.
\"What would be much more important for us to know is the actual prevalence of the infection overall.\"  Testing for the prevalence of the virus will complement diagnostic testing.
That people are dreaming of these things is no surprise given the anxiety caused by a new, contagious virus and the unprecedented social response to its spread, one expert says.

Given the fact that the fictional virus in the film and COVID-19 both originated in Asia and are easily transmitted through touch, it is not surprising that Contagion has been one of the top trending movies on both Amazon and iTunes since January.
A Charlottetown biotech company has joined the fight against COVID-19 by creating antibodies that could help detect the presence of the virus in humans.
(Submitted by Jon Zuccolo) Zuccolo compared the results from his chickens with other companies from around the world to make sure that his antibodies matched ones created by the actual virus.
Those chicken antibodies react with the COVID-19 virus in that fluid, said Zuccolo.
Because those chicken antibodies are similar to the ones that are created by a human to fight COVID-19, Zuccolo said he can use them to determine if someone had ever been exposed to the virus.
More than 2,600 Israelis have been infected by the new virus, with 41 in serious condition.

The doctors who eventually tested positive are believed to have contributed to the spread of the virus in the hospital while they were asymptomatic.
It's that simple.\" COVID-19 in Quebec: Healthy seniors living in CHSLDs can go home to families He said doctors are especially at risk because of just how contagious the virus is, and the fact that patients with it who show up to the hospital are the ones too sick to get tested at one of the designated clinics.
Those coming from Iran will be asked to report any symptoms that may be linked to the virus, or to self-isolate for 14 days if they are asymptomatic.
However, that has changed, with the virus now spreading through contact with infected people in the community.
All symptomatic staff and residents at seniors' homes where an outbreak has been declared must now be screened, as well as any asymptomatic residents or staff who came in contact with someone with COVID-19.
\"There continues to be no evidence of local circulation of the virus in Niagara ... therefore the risk to Niagara residents remains low.\" Multiple fatalities and infections have been linked to a single nursing home in Washington State.
\"We identify all of these contacts, we make sure that they are in quarantine, and that they don't go on to spread the infection any further.\" Testing people without symptoms In the Labrador-Grenfell Health region, and because of the assumed community spread of the virus, Piggott said even people with no symptoms have been tested.
You could eventually be exposed to COVID-19, but panic can be scarier than the virus, say experts To date, 2,700 people have died worldwide from COVID-19 and 78,000 have been infected.
AnalysisAs stock markets fall, the time to stock up at the store  is before COVID-19 comes to town: Don Pittis Gustafson says new information about COVID-19 is coming to light every day, and the more researchers learn, the more the virus appears to be similar to other respiratory infections that circulate in the community.
\"Even if the risk of infection is low, the possibility that one person might be carrying the COVID virus and not even know it could potentially result in the quarantine of 200 doctors and that would adversely affect our ability to provide health care for Albertans.\" Molnar said the AMA consulted with public-health officials who agreed it would be prudent to cancel the meeting, given the low risk but serious consequences of that particular gathering.
Experts say while heat can sometimes be used to kill viruses on surfaces, it doesn't work when the virus has already infected you.
Medicago uses \"virus-like particles\" — molecules that mimic the form of a virus, but without the infectious properties — that can trigger a human's immune system to create antibodies that can fight the actual virus.
It can result in excellent candidates that can produce a vaccine.\" Kobinger's research group is also using Medicago's technology to try to develop a therapeutic treatment for people already stricken by COVID-19, using copies of the antibodies found in the systems of people who were infected with the virus and have since recovered.
Local outbreaks have prompted public health units to create special teams of infection inspectors and acknowledge steps they took before the virus broke out in homes didn't go far enough to protect residents who are especially at risk.
Staff in Niagara have also begun testing more people in case they have asymptomatic infections.
The Associated Press) The best hope for every country is to flatten the so-called \"curve\" — slowing and limiting the spread of the virus so that health systems can properly deal with the most serious infections.
IOC president tries to boost Olympic morale in Japan, speaks to mediaStock markets finish rough week with another dive into the red Steps to limit spread of the virus would be assessed and taken after officials weighed the need to prevent the spread of infection against the need for communities to function.
Still, some of these untested individuals may, in fact, be infected with the virus.
Executive director Mark Aston says its on-site health clinic is currently screening for the virus and key staff are being fitted for specialized masks if infections appear.
CBC) \"Having to pull numbers of people out of the workforce ... creates significant strain on our health-care system and challenges the ability to deliver essential care, but we also have to make sure that we are not putting patients or co-workers at any increased risk of transmitting this virus.\" Strang also said the tests used to detect COVID-19 are accurate, but they don't always pick up the virus.
Six of the other long term care facilities identified with the virus have reported no new cases, but Henry said the infections at Haro Park in Vancouver's West End now include 28 residents and 27 staff.
Unlike SARS, where the symptoms were much more severe, a large proportion of individuals that are infected with coronavirus aren't sick enough to seek medical care, a significant factor in containing the virus.
\"It seems to be that, in general, this virus can live outside humans and then can infect other humans maybe for up to three to 72 hours,\" said Barrett.
I can't tell you the high regard I hold her in.\" 6 new COVID-19 infections in B.C. as virus spreads inside care home 'You're being put on the spot every minute' Henry's response also highlights the physical and emotional tolls of public health work in times of crisis, said Josh Greenberg, a professor of communication at Carleton University who studies public health responses in the media.
One problem, he said, is that patient-care attendants and other staff have continued to work with what they may have thought was just a mild cold, and other workers may have been infected but were asymptomatic.
After realizing asymptomatic people were transmitting COVID-19, Northwood started swabbing staff and residents who haven't previously been tested for the virus. (

A subcontractor working at a Syncrude site, whom CBC agreed not to name for fear of reprisal, is worried about how quickly the virus would spread if someone was infected.
Tam said the vast majority of people infected with the virus show very mild symptoms and can be cared for in the community, reserving scarce hospital resources for those who really need them.
Here are some basic facts about the virus, its symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you believe you are infected.
There is also some information about asymptomatic carriers, who may be infecting more people than anyone initially realized.
There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, but health organizations, like PHAC here in Canada and the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., recommend these preventive actions to help stop the spread of any respiratory viruses:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, with an alcohol content of at least 60 per cent.
After the SARS outbreak, PHAC asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks.
\"Once we realized that palm civets were the primary animal species transmitting it to humans, and the markets were eliminated, we literally shut off the faucet of new infections coming into humans,\" said Osterholm.
\"Though no one has yet done the definitive experiment of seeing whether it stays alive on a doorknob or not; I wouldn't be surprised if it did last for a limited period of time on inanimate objects.\" Fauci said it appears to take about six days for someone who has been infected to show symptoms, but it's not clear whether the virus can be spread by someone who does not appear to be sick.
Why they're putting out so much virus is just not clear.\" In the case of MERS, Osterholm said one person in a South Korean emergency room was able to infect 82 people in 2015.
Lessons from SARS and MERS One of the encouraging aspects of the SARS story is that the virus was contained, said Osterholm, pointing to Canada, where most of the more than 400 infections and 44 deaths happened in and around Toronto.
2:22 \"We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (\"asymptomatic\") and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (\"pre-symptomatic\") can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms,\" the agency said in a statement on its website.

The duo says they believe inmates will be safer from the highly contagious virus at home, rather than face the deadly disease while imprisoned in close quarters.
Some of the assumptions built into that budget will now go out the window, with all but a few local businesses ordered closed as part of measures to contain the spread of a virus that has infected almost two million people worldwide.
Asked why Kore wasn't directed to self-isolate, Hirji said the science behind COVID-19 indicates the virus is only contagious for seven or eight days after symptoms begin to show.
The virus has killed more than 130 people and infected more than 6,000 others — nearly all in China.
\"Emergency rooms in downtown are being kind of overwhelmed because there's no other place for isolation.\" And in those tight, enclosed areas, he warned, there is a risk of people transmitting the virus to other patients and staff.
Around that time, participants will be tested for antibodies to see if they have been infected, she said.
\"With some additional equipment and expansions, we probably can double that.\" People generate antibodies to defend themselves when infected by a virus.
Being able to determine if a person has developed antibodies to a virus would tell if they were once infected and had developed immunity.
\"If and when we develop a vaccine we will be able to see how many people have been infected and help triage those who have been infected or those who have not been infected yet to get the vaccine first.\" 'Too early to know' Hachette was happy to hear a homegrown company had developed an antibody test, but remained cautious about the overall value.
He also said guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — which has its headquarters in Georgia — that people could spread the virus earlier than previously thought, even when they had no symptoms, was a \"game-changer.\" \"Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad.
Health officials had expressed concern that the virus could be transmitted this way.\" This is why we need a national test, trace, and quarantine program.
CBC Windsor's April 15 COVID-19 update: 16 people have died, 59 new cases Erie Shores HealthCare outlined the following groups prioritized for testing based on a directive from the chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams:  Symptomatic health care workers and staff who work in health care facilities Symptomatic residents and staff in long term care facilities and retirement homes Asymptomatic new admissions or re-admissions to long-term care or retirement home Hospitalized patients admitted with respiratory symptoms (new or exacerbated) Symptomatic members of remote, isolated, rural and/ or indigenous communities Symptomatic travellers identified at a point of entry to Canada Symptomatic community/ ambulatory people with medical co-morbidities Symptomatic community/ ambulatory people working in an essential industry with the inability to isolate, such as migrants workers Symptomatic healthcare workers, caregivers (i.e. volunteers, family members of residents in an institutional setting), care providers (e.g., employees, privately-hired support workers) and first responders.
\"The fact that the virus survives best on non-porous materials, such as plastic or stainless steel, means that debit or credit card terminals or PIN pads could transmit the virus too.\" 'Risk can be mitigated' \"We know that [COVID-19] can stick to surfaces for a few hours to a few days, and this may include hard currency,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist and scientist with the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute.
TTC no longer accepting cash, tokens, youth and senior tickets on buses \"At the same time, we have a bunch of unbanked people in our society, and people who live in the cash economy are often some of the most vulnerable.\"  Health authorities say there is no specific danger from cash in terms of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19, as opposed to any other surface.
Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, the city's medical officer of health, told CBC News officials don't know if the woman caught the virus from the first infected person at Heritage Green and likely won't be able to find out.
Officials defend quarantine Japan ranks second in the world after China in the number of confirmed virus cases due to the ship infections.
Frontline health-care workers prepare for battle — and burnout \"When we start talking about flattening the curve, it's not necessarily the tests per day that are important, it's the number of people getting infected, and making sure we can look back at those days ahead and isolate people before they can transmit it to others,\" she said.
The virus would have opportunities to infect many more people, through coughing, sneezing or breathing, said the Deputy Director of the Commission, Li Bin — and would alter and mutate.
One post under the name 'Phoenix' said \"hiding the virulence of the virus or the number of people infected is a cover-up!
So far, B.C., along with most of the world, has basically relied on genetic testing that detects whether the virus itself is in a patient, but soon testing will begin to detect whether a person has antibodies produced in reaction to SARS-CoV-2.
She said, so far, testing hasn't been done on everyone who has shown signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, because the focus has been on clusters of infection and people more likely to catch the disease and wind up in the health-care system.
Why Canada is taking so long to start testing blood for COVID-19 Henry said serology testing can also help us understand whether infected people who have recovered have become immune to the virus — something she says health officials believe is the case.
\"There are going to be asymptomatic people that do carry this this virus and we know that that's happened in other areas.\"  'They gambled': Northern crisis worker says Sask.

There are also outbreaks at the Montfort Hospital next door where the virus has spread in multiple locations, including the intensive care unit, according to data from Ottawa Public Health.. OPH's definition of an institutional outbreak includes when one or more patients test positive for COVID-19 and where there is a reasonable probability they got infected at the facility.
Ladhani said some of the most common cases of disinformation are people believing healthy people should still wear a mask at all times, a myth that garlic can ward off infection and misleading reports that ultraviolet disinfection lamps can kill the virus.
If a person were to test positive for the virus, that data could be used to identify everyone else who may have been infected as well.
Identifying antibodies Researchers are looking at whether the kits would be able to identify antibodies and whether that would give someone immunity from the virus or not.

\"If you get the virus on your hands, this virus does not infect you through your skin,\" said McGeer.
She said wearing a mask is an added layer of protection that can help prevent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people from inadvertently infecting others with COVID-19.
She said there is also now evidence that shows the virus can be transmitted by people who never develop symptoms, called asymptomatic transmission.

As for whether second-hand smoke could transmit the virus, the experts we spoke to said they were not aware of any research on the topic, but that such transmission was unlikely.
By definition, herd immunity is when a large enough share of the population has been infected with a virus and is now immune, meaning the virus can't spread on its own, and its reproduction rate is below one per cent, according to Erin Strumpf, a health economics expert at McGill University.
While it's unclear how effective sick children are at transmitting the virus, Strumpf said, seniors and at-risk individuals would have to continue to self-isolate for as long as it takes to arrive at herd immunity.

CSC said it is taking \"immediate action when an employee is symptomatic, including thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the space and ensuring the employee self-isolates at home until cleared to return to work.\" Several other measures are now in place to try to contain the virus, including enhanced screening for anyone entering the institution.
Port-Cartier Mayor Alain Thibault said the federal prison is one of the town's main employers, and having nine correctional service workers infected means many more may have come in contact with the virus. (
Submitted by Nalcor Energy) Nalcor has adopted a variety of safety measures to ensure workers are not infected with the virus, including daily temperature testing of all workers, physical distancing, and enhanced sanitization.
Matt Prokopchuk / CBC) He also said the union would like the government to reconsider its advice to health-care workers about how the virus is transmitted.
System couldn't handle 'extreme' scenario An extreme model, with 1.6 million infections and 16,000 to 32,000 total deaths was provided to show how the virus would have spread if Alberta had not taken mitigation measures like closing businesses, schools and public buildings, and encouraging people to stay home.
All symptomatic health-care workers and people who live or work in remote communities or group settings — such as correctional facilities, shelters, long-term care or residential facilities, and remote work camps — can now be tested for the virus.
In that period, the virus has killed 2,264 people and infected nearly 1,200 more, making it the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history.
There are 45 cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick (Photo: CBC News) About 120,000 people live in the area and, although the zero infection rate sounds like good news, it is impossible to know how aggressively the province has been hunting for the virus in those communities.
They face fewer risks of getting a serious case of COVID-19 than the elderly and people with underlying health issues, so the potential for them to transmit the virus without knowing is high.
All lab testing and processing for both in- and out-patients of the region's hospitals is provided by EORLA at 19 sites, with its CHEO lab taking on virus assessment for children and adults alike as its specialty — a natural role for a hospital that deals with frequent viral infections in children.
It's true that many people who get the new virus experience mild symptoms, but a great danger of COVID-19 is that people assume that is the universal and expected result of infection.
The Public Health Agency of Canada says there is no evidence to suggest dogs can catch COVID-19, but there may be a chance if someone pets or coughs on an animal that the virus could be transmitted to the next person who pets the animal.
The key will be for provinces to be prepared to rapidly respond and continue contact tracing, he said, or else just one infected person could easily spread the virus and cause a significant outbreak.
Health Minister John Haggie said people were gathering together before and after motorcades, raising the risk of transmitting the highly infectious virus that causes COVID-19.
