Darko Vojinovic/The Associated Press) Putting off kids' vaccines during COVID-19 heightens risk of other outbreaks With daycares and schools closed across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, immunization requirements aren't being enforced by public health officials.
Not all medical clinics and doctor's offices have the infrastructure or enough personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves and masks to offer routine vaccinations safely.
\"It's not prevention of a disease, per se, but it's prevention of an epidemic.\" Most experts suggest herd immunity cannot be achieved safely without a vaccine because seniors and other vulnerable populations with suppressed immune systems would be at risk and hospitals would be overwhelmed.
Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said herd immunity without a vaccine is \"theoretically possible\" if everyone, or almost everyone, who becomes infected develops antibodies that will protect them for life.
An infectious disease specialist answers your questions about COVID-19, including whether herd immunity could eventually be as effective as a vaccine.

However, Henry cautioned that significant restrictions would still be in place for some time — likely until a vaccine has been developed for the virus — and that B.C.'s continued success in avoiding a large outbreak would rely on public health measures rather than developing herd immunity.

With the outbreak of the mask wars across shuttered Western borders, and alongside outright bans of exports of medical equipment, any hint of a unified global effort to fight the coronavirus is absent, beyond the work of scientists cooperating on a possible vaccine.
Dr. Yonatan Grad, an assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote recently in an op-ed for STAT that there are two ways to achieve this: immunity from infection or immunity through vaccination.
