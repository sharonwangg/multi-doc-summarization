2020-03-24 00:00:00	 With growing fears of a wider economic meltdown caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, economists are suddenly considering the helicopter option, though the subject remains controversial. Known as helicopter money, the concept was proposed as a thought experiment by Nobel Prize-winning American economist Milton Friedman as an alternative to governments borrowing and spending to stimulate the economy. While no actual helicopters are used in the process, the one thing most economists agree on is that it involves the distribution of money into the economy in a way that boosts the spending power of ordinary citizens. Friedman, who died in 2006, was one of the founders of the Chicago school of economics that tended to oppose government involvement in the workings of the economy. In general, Friedman objected to the fiscal spending championed by Keynesians, who believe that governments should borrow money and spend it on anything from roads to schools to reignite economic growth. In the helicopter theory's original form, Friedman saw this distribution of cash in the economy as something to be used when interest rates had gone as low as they could go and the economy was refusing to respond to other kinds of monetary stimulus. \"When the economics community talks about helicopter money, what they really mean is, at the end of the day, the Bank of Canada could print money and simply send it to Canadians,\" Craig Alexander, Deloitte Canada's chief economist, said in an interview last week.

In order to prevent the collapse of the economy, aggressive fiscal and monetary policy become the order of the day.   In the 2008 Great Recession, the opposition parties forced Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pass a massive fiscal stimulus package to prevent unemployment and bankruptcy. Canada's economy is in for a rough springAnalysisThe Great Recession nearly killed Harper's government — and COVID-19 could be worse The treasury bailed out the financial system and Obama's $800-billion stimulus bill extended unemployment benefits, rebuilt roads and bridges, prevented teacher layoffs and provided temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy. For economists like Paul Krugman, while the stimulus prevented a deeper decline in the economy, it should have been much larger.   Members of Manitoba's business community have described the province's approach as \"penny wise and pound foolish.\" As Stiglitz suggests, such cutbacks in jobs and funding \"will show up in the unemployment statistics, but the deeper effects — on our economic growth and social fabric — won't be fully apparent for years to come.\"  No other government in Canada has done more to damage  our future with less economic justification than the government of Manitoba.

2020-05-01 00:00:00	 Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Université Laval and member of the council, says the current economic slowdown is a great example of how the \"two quarters of contraction\" definition of a recession is too dogmatic. By the \"two quarters of economic decline\" definition, Canada had a brief, slight recession in late 2014 and early 2015, as the price of oil crashed. The council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market. There are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were implemented across the country. And since a rebound in the summer is quite plausible, that would make the current recession only one-quarter long — Statistics Canada reported Thursday that economic growth had stalled going into the crisis, with real gross domestic product essentially unchanged in February due to teacher strikes in Ontario and rail blockades across many parts of the country.

Wang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects. Widely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line. BMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped.   " Lee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent.

2020-04-25 00:00:00	 Canada's economy is in for a rough springAnalysisThe Great Recession In the 2008 Great Recession, the opposition parties forced Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pass a massive fiscal stimulus package to prevent unemployment and bankruptcy. Without government support, the authors argue, huge structural problems with the economy will prolong the economic impact of the pandemic. In order to prevent the collapse of the economy, aggressive fiscal and monetary policy become the order of the day.   nearly killed Harper's government — and COVID-19 could be worse The treasury bailed out the financial system and Obama's $800-billion stimulus bill extended unemployment benefits, rebuilt roads and bridges, prevented teacher layoffs and provided temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy. For economists like Paul Krugman, while the stimulus prevented a deeper decline in the economy, it should have been much larger.   Members of Manitoba's business community have described the province's approach as \"penny wise and pound foolish.\" As Stiglitz suggests, such cutbacks in jobs and funding \"will show up in the unemployment statistics, but the deeper effects — on our economic growth and social fabric — won't be fully apparent for years to come.\"  No other government in Canada has done more to damage  our future with less economic justification than the government of Manitoba.

He says that's why the government is moving ahead with a plan to restart the economy and reopen primary schools and daycares.  The country had been in a strict lockdown for over a month to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, but those conditions were eased a little on Tuesday to allow some parts of the economy to restart as new infections wane.

2020-05-01 00:00:00	 By the \"two quarters of economic decline\" definition, Canada had a brief, slight recession in late 2014 and early 2015, as the price of oil crashed. The council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market. There are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were implemented across the country. Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Université Laval and member of the council, says the current economic slowdown is a great example of how the \"two quarters of contraction\" definition of a recession is too dogmatic. And since a rebound in the summer is quite plausible, that would make the current recession only one-quarter long — Statistics Canada reported Thursday that economic growth had stalled going into the crisis, with real gross domestic product essentially unchanged in February due to teacher strikes in Ontario and rail blockades across many parts of the country.

Earlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported the economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession, ending the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. Many health experts have also begun to predict a seasonal resurgence of COVID-19 in the fall, whatever containment measures are put in place, raising the possibility that stay-at-home restrictions may need to be reintroduced, and with them, a new downturn in economic growth.
