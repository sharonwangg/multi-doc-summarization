  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"

What you need to know today in Canada: Later this morning, Canada will announce new modelling projections for COVID-19 cases and death. The last modelling update was in early April and projected anywhere from 11,000 to 22,000 people could die in this country over the course of the pandemic. That figure included the scenario of Canada following physical-distancing guidelines and taking other disease-prevention measures. WATCH: What happens after Canadians flatten the curve: The curve for COVID-19 cases in Canada is starting to flatten, but before cases see a major decrease in the number of deaths that number will continue to rise. 2:02 Canada's top doctor has said officials didn't close the Canada/U.S. border sooner because a border closure wasn't part of the government's pandemic preparedness plan. Dr. Theresa Tam gave CBC News an interview about the country's response to COVID-19.

  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning.  If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   Understanding how COVID-19 attacks the human body is essential to developing an effective treatment or vaccine to stop the global pandemic —  but there's still so much we don't know about how it can kill us. As researchers around the world race to understand the illness, they are compiling and sharing their early observations of patients hit by a virus that has sickened more than two million people. The findings are preliminary, but they can help point researchers in the right directions. They have seen that in severe cases, COVID-19 invades our respiratory cells and triggers an immune system response that targets those infected cells, destroys lung tissue and ultimately clogs our airways, cutting off our oxygen supply.   That's when organ failure can also occur, causing severe damage to the kidneys, liver and heart, similar to other conditions like sepsis.   But they will look to determine whether the virus is targeting and shutting down organs in a new way or just behaving like other infections that cause such common complications. Why COVID-19 can be so deadly One key thing to understand about the deadliness of the coronavirus is how it infects the body and how our body responds to fight it.   Cytokines are small molecules released by the immune system that travel throughout the body to co-ordinate an immune response against an infection or injury — even with something as common as a mild fever.   But if the immune system overproduces them in response to the infection, they can cause \"cytokine storms\" that can rampage through the bloodstream and severely damage the body.   INTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?   Dr. Douglas Fraser, an ICU doctor at London Health Sciences Centre and a researcher at Western University in London, Ont., has been studying that exaggerated immune response by collecting blood from critically ill COVID-19 patients in an effort to find new ways to treat the disease.   \"The immune response to this particular disease is very different than what we've seen in other infected patients that end up in the ICU,\ " he said. \"It's a unique response and it's going to require unique therapies.\ "  Fraser said his research shows there are different types of cytokines released in the body at unusual times and levels in response to COVID-19 compared with those that are typically found in critically ill patients from more common diseases.   \"What we're seeing seems to be occurring in all of the very sick patients: those who are requiring the ICU admissions, those who are requiring assistance with their breathing and those that are ultimately dying,\ " he said. Kidneys tied to severe complications Kidney damage was an \"important complication\ " in a preliminary publication of a recent observational study of 287 COVID-19 patients in China, which found almost one in five had some stage of sudden or \"acute\" kidney injury, putting them at \"substantially higher\" risk of death. While it's not yet known what rate of Canadian COVID-19 patients have acute kidney damage, the majority occurs in severely ill patients, said Dr. Jeffrey Perl, a nephrologist at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto and an assistant medical professor at the University of Toronto.   Second OpinionHow will the global coronavirus pandemic end? \"As people's blood pressure gets very low from a very massive, overwhelming inflammatory immune response, the kidneys are starved of blood,\" he said, adding that it can often lead to the need for a dialysis machine to clean the patient's blood. To give an idea of how serious a complication it can be, Perl said the mortality rate for patients who had developed acute kidney injury from SARS in 2003 was 92 per cent, compared to just eight per cent in those who didn't.   Toronto General Hospital employee Maria Tanta, left, a recovery room nurse, has her temperature checked by nurse Callie Dunne during the SARS epidemic on April 2, 2003. (J.P. Moczulski/Canadian Press) Chronic kidney patients are also at higher risk of death with COVID-19 compared to those without pre-existing conditions who are otherwise well, he added.   \"We're very worried about those patients getting a COVID-19 infection,\" he said.  \"Similar to the elderly population that we're very concerned about, I would consider these patients another high-risk group.\ "  Heart may be 'directly' targeted by virus One essential organ that may be at direct risk from the virus is the heart. A cohort study published in JAMA last month found almost 20 per cent of 416 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China had heart damage during hospitalization, putting them at a higher risk for death.   Recent research from the American College of Cardiology found arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, in 16 per cent of patients and acute cardiac injury in 7.2 per cent. Second OpinionHow deadly is COVID-19? Why it's different in every country \"There's the possibility and the likelihood that some of the virus might actually get taken directly up into the heart muscle cells and cause that heart injury,\" said Dr. Patrick Lawler, a cardiologist and clinician scientist at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in Toronto.   \"We hear anecdotes from other people that have had a little bit more experience, unfortunately, with this that really are consistent with the heart suddenly starting to become weak.\ "  An observational study of 187 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month found high levels of troponin, which can indicate problems with the heart, in 28 per cent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, which concluded they were at risk of \"much higher mortality.\ "  A medical worker checks on a patient's condition at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province on Feb. 16. Emerging research shows the heart may be at direct risk from the virus. One study in China found almost 20 per cent of 416 patients had cardiac issues. (Chinatopix/The Associated Press) Lawler said the outcomes for COVID-19 patients with cardiac issues are \"dramatically worse,\" and even though the virus enters through the respiratory system, it can take root in other areas of the body.   \"The heart is really a critical, critical part of what determines whether or not patients are going to recover from this or not,\ " he said. Can it help us find a cure? Lawler is currently looking at the use of blood thinners as a possible treatment for COVID-19 patients, which may prevent the virus from binding to ACE2 receptors — enzymes found in cells throughout the human body that can act as an entryway for coronaviruses.   He said research suggests blood clots may play a role in organ failure in critically ill patients, so different doses of anticoagulants may prevent that from happening.   Fraser is also using his research on the \"cytokine storm\" immune response to COVID-19 to find \"targets\" to further efforts toward an effective treatment.   ' We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up He said there could be multiple components to why different people are susceptible to the virus that range from genetics, to pre-existing conditions to age. \"Once we have an understanding of what's going on, we can develop therapies, we can develop vaccines,\ " he said.   \"Then we can get back to a normal life.\"   To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by clicking here.

(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press) In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced major travel restrictions in an effort to stem the coronavirus pandemic that has now killed four people in the country. He said Canada will be denying entry to most non-citizens or non-residents, but exceptions will be made for diplomats, people with family in Canada and U.S. citizens, citing the level of integration between the two countries.

  A million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by British scientists are already being manufactured and will be available by September, even before trials prove whether the shot is effective, the team said on Friday. The Oxford University team's experimental product, called \"ChAdOx1 nCoV-19,\" is a type known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine, and is one of at least 70 potential COVID-19 candidate shots under development by biotech and research teams around the world. At least five of those are in preliminary testing in people. The Oxford scientists said Friday they were recruiting volunteers for early stage — Phase 1 — human trials of their shot, and large-scale production capacity was being put in place \"at risk.\ " This means the shots will be produced in large numbers at risk of being useless if trials show they do not work. \"We have started at risk manufacturing of this vaccine not just on a smallish scale ... but with a network of manufacturers in as many as seven different places around the world,\" Adrian Hill, a professor and director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, told reporters in an online briefing. Oxford University professor Adrian Hill said his team plans to have 'at least a million doses' of the vaccine ready by September. (Eddie Keogh/Reuters) \"The aim is to have at least a million doses by around about September, when we also hope to have efficacy [trial] results.\ " He said three of the manufacturing partners were in Britain, two in Europe, one in India and one in China. The scientists said initial manufacturing costs would be in the \"tens of millions\" of pounds and acknowledged the investment risk of pressing ahead with production before verification. They did not give details of their financing. Vaccine trials to begin within weeks By 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, more than 2.18 million people had been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally, according to a Johns Hopkins tally. There have been nearly 150,000 deaths. Hill's team said it plans to start safety and then mid-stage efficacy trials of the potential COVID-19 vaccine in adults aged between 18 and 55 within weeks. They then plan to expand the trial group to older ages later, and hope to run a final phase trial with around 5,000 volunteers in the late summer. 117 million children risk missing measles vaccines due to COVID-19 pandemic'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Hill and his co-researchers acknowledged that many other research teams worldwide were also working on potential vaccines, with only a proportion likely to be fully successful. Asked when the shot — if proven to work — might be able to be made widely available to the public, Hill said the best-case scenario would be for regulators to grant it \"emergency use  approval.\ " That could be achieved within six weeks beyond the point at which data shows whether it is effective. That, he said, could mean around six weeks from September, when the team hopes to have positive trial data.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on April 17

Vaccine compliance Dr. Henry said once a vaccine becomes available there are plans in place for mass vaccination clinics. Health-care workers, seniors and those who are immunocompromised will be prioritized.   \"It doesn't mean that everybody has to have this, and certainly, we don't have any mandatory immunizations in this country and I would not see us having mandatory immunization either,' said Henry.

  Ottawa is giving $23 million to VIDO-InterVac in Saskatoon. The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre is based at the University of Saskatchewan. Half of the money is earmarked to build a pilot-scale manufacturing plant on campus to accelerate vaccine development. \"The $12 million enables us to build the facility to good manufacturing practices standards as required for human vaccine production,\" said VIDO-InterVac director Volker Gerdts. \"We expect to begin vaccine production in a little more than a year.\"   Go inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine    There is currently no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. VIDO-InterVac is the first lab in the country to have a vaccine candidate in animal testing. The vaccine was made in February, and researchers expect to know in about four weeks whether the vaccine works in an animal model. Clinical testing of this vaccine in humans could start as early as this fall. The balance of the money will go to operational funding for high-containment laboratories.

' A race against the disease': Canadian researchers part of global effort to develop COVID-19 vaccine On the quiet, shuttered campus of the University of Saskatchewan, Dr. Volker Gerdts and his research team are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and they are feeling the pressure to move faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. Watch | Canada's role in the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine   A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and Saskatchewan governments to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\"  Read more on this story here. Keeping fit   (Carl Recine/Reuters) With pools shut down due to the coronavirus outbreak, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington has taken to training in this small pool in his garden at home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England. He's seen here tethered to a fence as he does some backstroke in this photo taken yesterday. In brief An associate professor of biology in Saskatchewan has raised the ire of other scientists after he claimed that most people in the province had already contracted the novel coronavirus and recovered from it, rendering the COVID-19 lockdown unnecessary.  Experts are criticizing Josef Buttigieg of the University of Regina, who specializes in neurobiology and stem cell physiology, for social media posts that cast doubt on the province's physical distancing measures and the competence of Saskatchewan health officials. In a widely shared video posted on April 8, Buttigieg said the Saskatchewan Health Authority has demonstrated \"gross ineptness\" in its handling of the pandemic because it has been unwilling to conduct or approve antibody testing.  Read more on the reaction to the professor's comments here. Watch | Saskatchewan biologist's claims about COVID-19 questioned   When things are going right and we feel safe, it is reasonable that many of us throw caution to the wind and live a little closer to the edge.  But from Canadian investors redeeming $14 billion in mutual funds in March to our sudden urge to fill our homes with supplies of food and toilet paper, the risk-taking mood seems to have changed. As CBC business columnist Don Pittis writes, the new mood against risk may be the impetus that many have called for to make all Canadians, not just aging boomers, be more frugal.  Read more on how our appetite for risk may have changed.   As job losses mount and self-isolation continues, half of Canadians say their mental health has gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10 per cent reporting it has deteriorated \"a lot,\" according to a new survey. Less than 20 per cent of Canadians polled reported being optimistic when asked to survey their life in the past couple of weeks, and 16 per cent described themselves as depressed, according to the online survey released Monday by the Angus Reid Institute. Despite reporting a decline in mental health, three-quarters of Canadians believe it's too soon to begin lifting restrictions on businesses and public gatherings, the survey said.  Read about the survey results here.   Federal Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault says he expects money from an emergency COVID-19 general business wage-subsidy program to start flowing within weeks to Canada's beleaguered newspaper industry. However, critics say this financial lifeline may come too late to save the pandemic crisis-accelerated loss of newspapers and media jobs — specifically, because a stalled $595-million financial-assistance program announced two years ago has yet to provide any money to increasingly desperate newspaper publishers.  Read more on the financial assistance for newspapers here.

Nicholas, 12, of Fredericton wants to know what happens if both of his parents catch COVID-19. Toronto-area pediatrician Dr. Dina Kulik recommends giving them space, so you don't get the virus too. \"It depends on your age,\" says Kulik. \"If you are old enough to take care of yourself, cook your own meals, and don't need your parents to care for you day-to-day, I would suggest isolating from them.\" However, every family should have a plan, and if the parents and child feel as though the child would be better off living with a friend or relative, then that's an option too. But Kulik cautions that it's possible the child could be asymptomatic.  Read more about our Q&A here.    Now for some good news to start your Monday:  When Shaleen Kennedy and Jonathan Neary's April 22 wedding in Jamaica got cancelled due to coronavirus, they decided to bring Jamaica to their St. John's home on their would-be wedding day. The couple got some sand for a makeshift beach, added a baby pool on their deck, and put up decorations for an impromptu celebration. Kennedy said the couple has managed to rebook their wedding down south for April 20, 2021, thanks to some great travel agents and vendors. \"We decided on forever, but COVID-19 decided on the date,\ " she said.  Read more about how the couple chose to mark what would have been their wedding day. Front Burner: 13 hours, 22 killings: New details emerge in Nova Scotia Nova Scotia is still coming to terms with the mass shooting that unfolded just over a week ago, taking the lives of 22 people. The RCMP has released a more detailed timeline, including information provided by a surviving witness — a woman who had been in a relationship with the gunman — speculation about how the gunman escaped a police perimeter, and more. But questions remain about the crimes and the RCMP's response.  CBC News' Brett Ruskin returns to give us insight into what we know and the unanswered questions that still linger.   Today in history: April 27 1644:  Wheat is planted in Canada for the first time near what is now Montreal.   1813:  A force of 1,800 Americans lands at York (now Toronto) and the outnumbered British garrison withdraws. The town is sacked and the parliament buildings are burned down. In retaliation for this action and the destruction of Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont.), the British raided Buffalo and Washington and set fire to the White House.   1928: Prince Edward Island changes to driving on the right-hand side of the road.   1967:  Expo 67 is opened in Montreal by Prime Minister Lester Pearson.     1992 : Lina Haddad, 27, gives birth in Montreal to the first quintuplets ever born in Quebec — three boys and two girls.   2010:  Peter Milliken, Speaker of the House of Commons, delivers a historic ruling saying that the government's refusal to hand over uncensored documents on Afghan detainees violated the privilege of the House. The documents at issue were believed to contain information related to the alleged torture of prisoners transferred to Afghan authorities by Canadian soldiers. 
  The latest:   There are now 1,084 cases of COVID-19 linked to the Cargill meat-packing plant near High River, Alta., and 710 workers have tested positive. Those cases represent nearly a quarter of all cases in the province. Filipino workers at the Cargill plant say they feel unfairly blamed for the outbreak, and workers have accused the company of ignoring physical-distancing protocols. An outbreak on the Eden Valley First Nation has grown to 14 cases, and 1 case has been confirmed in Morley. Over the weekend, Tsuut'ina First Nation introduced fines for those who break curfew, in the hope of stopping COVID-19 cases from entering from nearby 'high-risk' Calgary. There are 4 cases of COVID-19 among the homeless population, 3 at the Calgary Drop-In Centre and 1 at the Calgary Salvation Army . The province has begun asymptomatic testing of clients and staff at shelters. Alberta confirmed 216 new cases on Monday, up to a total of 4,696. Two more deaths were reported, bringing the total to 75. Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, said Albertans deserve credit for keeping the number of hospitalizations in the province well below projections. AISH and Income Support recipients will be able to collect a federal employment subsidy and have a portion of it be exempt.   Calgary continues to lead the province in the number of COVID-19 cases. (CBC) What you need to know in Alberta today: Lawyers and advocates are raising the alarm over how jury trials may be affected by COVID-19 physical-distancing restrictions. Court officials have suggested there may be ways to run trials as judge-alone in the spirit of efficiency. Defence lawyers, however, say an accused's right to a jury of peers should be more important. Half of independent restaurants might not reopen after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, according to a new survey by industry group Restaurants Canada. Lance Hurtubise, president and CEO of Vintage Group, owns eight Calgary restaurants including the well-known Vintage Chophouse. He says reopening his restaurants won't be easy. (Terri Trembath/CBC) A veteran Calgary restaurateur said that to open his businesses, he's looking at $60,000 for each one just on reopening costs. ' The unknowns are killing us': Restaurateurs say future is bleak for local dining, even post-pandemic People on AISH and Income Support who qualify for the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) will be able to collect the federal employment subsidy and have a portion of it be exempt from what's counted for their provincial benefits. Many people receiving AISH or Income Support earn a wage from employment, as well. WATCH: What happens after Canadians flatten the curve: The curve for COVID-19 cases in Canada is starting to flatten, but before cases see a major decrease in the number of deaths that number will continue to rise. 2:02 The province will exempt a portion of the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) for people on AISH and Income Support who qualify for the federal program.

  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  A clinic designed to vaccinate children under the age of two opened in Ottawa Tuesday to ensure babies get routine immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian Paediatric Society has been calling on doctors to continue providing in-person inoculations for infants and toddlers as many family physicians switch to phone consultations in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious disease physician at CHEO and chair of Immunize Canada, strongly encourages infant vaccinations during the pandemic because other illnesses could spread once physical distancing measures are relaxed. \"It is imperative that the interruption of routine immunizations be minimized, particularly in young infants and vulnerable populations,\ " she said in a news release from CHEO on Tuesday. The hospital, along with Ottawa Public Health and other health care providers \"saw the need to provide another option and reduce barriers\" to allow families to access primary immunizations for babies, the news release from CHEO said. \"Access to [vaccinations] may be difficult for some families and community pediatricians fully support any effort to reduce the barriers in receiving these immunizations,\" said Kathy Keely, a community pediatrician in Ottawa. Why the 'Kids Come First' health team wants to make sure kids under 2 don't miss out on their first vaccinations during this pandemic. 8:44 The Children's Immunization Clinic will provide a number of vaccines to babies and toddlers, including:   The five-in-one vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B) given at two, four, six and 18 months. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given at two, four and 12 months. Rotavirus vaccine given at two, four and six months. Meningococcal conjugate type C given at 12 months. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine given at 12 months. Chicken pox vaccine given at 15 months.   Families who need vaccinations should first contact their primary care provider, CHEO said. If an appointment cannot be arranged, families can call Ottawa Public Health at 613-580-6744 to book an appointment at the immunization clinic. While the clinic is only for children two and under, older children and adolescents including newcomers to Canada who did not receive their primary series of vaccines are also eligible to get vaccinations at the clinic, CHEO said. 
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV. 
 Clarification: This story was originally published March 4, 2020. Much of what we know about the COVID-19 virus has changed since this interview. The information shared here regarding travel and how to protect yourself should not be considered most up to date but the instructions around hand washing are still useful.   Dr. Zain Chagla, infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton answered, Thursday, your questions and responded to your comments on the coronavirus outbreak. In Canada, public health officials have reported 33 cases of COVID-19. The virus emerged in China late last year and has spread around the world. According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization,  \"about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.\ " Trudeau says 'knee-jerk reactions' won't stop spread of COVID-19 While the Public Health Agency of Canada says the risk is low in Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said it's \"important for each of us to be prepared for all scenarios.\ "  So, how do we prepare? How do we protect ourselves and the people around us? We asked Dr. Chagla. Here's what he had to say. Read below for an abridged and edited version of his Facebook Live interview with CBC's Conrad Collaco or click on the play button above to watch the entire interview.   Dr. Zain Chagla, infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare   When compared to the flu and SARS how serious is this virus? Dr. Chagla: SARS is probably the closest example to this coronavirus. They are cousin viruses. In 2002 SARS infected, not a lot of people, about 3,000 total. But the issue was about a quarter of them did ultimately pass on from the illness. So SARS was a viral infection that, didn't infect a ton, but caused a lot of death. Influenza is kind of the opposite.  We deal with this on a year to year basis. We had, obviously, a very bad year in 2009 with the pandemic influenza. And so the issue with influenza is we have a lot of people infected. Very few actually die but a lot of people come down with the illness. The coronavirus somewhere fits in between.  So, definitely more people infected than the SARS virus of 2002/2003 but much less death than we saw with SARS. What should people be doing to protect themselves? The advice we're giving people is very similar to what we give people in the typical flu season. The way we can track this virus is really by respiratory droplets —  those big droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze or those droplets getting on surfaces and then touching eyes, ears, nose, mouth and getting it into the person that way. Islanders: What to do if you think you have COVID-19 The protection for the average person is the big things of washing your hands regularly, especially when you're touching those high touch surfaces, making sure that if you have to cough or sneeze that you cough and sneeze into your sleeve rather than on your hands where you can transmit it person to person. If you're sick, stay home and avoid infecting the public. So those are the big pieces of advice and stay standard throughout this season regardless of coronavirus. This question comes in from Louise. \"My husband and I are planning a trip to the Maritimes next week. We hoped to drive down and visit for about 10 days. I am concerned whether this is advisable or not? We would be staying at hotels on the way down and then with family in the Maritimes. The trip is not essential. I had hoped to visit family and friends and soak in some of that great salt sea air. Oh, and eat lots of seafood. Would you advise postponing the trip or do you think it would be an overreaction to cancel? That sounds like an incredible experience. There are some concerns around travel and as we know this is a disease where most of our cases in Canada have been related to travel or contacts of those who have traveled.  Outside of Canada the situation is a little bit different. We've seen other countries as close as the United States where there's been some transmission within those communities to people that haven't traveled. So, generally for travel there is a risk that you could acquire the infection, although within Canada I think our situation is pretty stable right now. We haven't seen, in any of our studies, cases coming from the community. So a trip like that to the Maritimes is pretty safe. The other nice part of that trip is getting home isn't that difficult. You're driving out and you're driving back. How to prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak In Iran, China, Italy, South Korea and Japan, not only is the situation evolving and there is a risk of acquiring the infection abroad, but even if the situation changes and things like flights get delayed you know airports are shut down there may be difficulties getting back home. We saw that in some Canadians that were originally stuck in Wuhan. This may evolve in a country during a trip. There are case transmissions ongoing in Spain and France and Germany where we don't know what the situation is going to be like at the end of the week. So, bottom line is I think it's still safe to travel. Be very careful traveling to those zones of the world that are very high risk. Be prepared.  Have patience.  Make sure that you have a stable supply of medications you have trip cancellation and travel insurance. Be prepared that you may have some difficulties coming home. Pregnancy   (Facebook) At this time, very little is known about pregnancy — and a lot inferred from prior SARS and related MERS outbreaks. From the limited data, pregnant women may be at higher risk of becoming ill or going into preterm labour if they were to acquire COVID-19, but this is similar to influenza as well. The risk in Canada is fortunately low, and the most important thing is exercising good hand hygiene. This question comes in from Sue. \"How does someone self isolating in their apartment affect the rest of the people living on that floor, or in the rest of the building? When does self isolation in an apartment building affect the ability of residents in other apts to come and go, when they are without signs or symptoms of infection?\ " So, it's a really good question. I would, first of all, recommend everyone who's interested in what self-isolation looks like, both from the standpoint of the patient or family members, to look at the Public Health Ontario website. Someone who is symptomatic and is diagnosed with coronavirus living in an apartment, they would be told to self isolate at home. If you're doing well like 80 per cent of people you wouldn't think differently than any other season.  'Herd effect': Social media images of empty shelves fuelling panic buying over coronavirus, says prof If there are other people in the apartment it's still safe for them to be around.   The recommendation is the person that has the infection, and even the people in the apartment, wear masks during all their contact. They stay about two meters apart from each other while in the apartment together. This is again a droplet virus. So it doesn't really travel through ventilation, especially the ventilation we see in fairly modern buildings in Hamilton and region. What is being done at St. Joe's to deal with the outbreak? Ontario is very unique in that we dealt with SARS in 2002, really one of the few areas in the world that had to uniquely deal with SARS as part of its pandemic plan. So, we have had a plan in terms of how to deal with emerging infectious diseases for the last 20 years and really we've re updated that plan when we came down to H1N1 in 2009 when Ebola became an issue in West Africa. As Canadians clamour for coronavirus vaccine, many aren't getting immunized against other diseases A hospital is a mix between a ton of departments, clinical services, administrative services, infection control. For the last few weeks we've been really working to make sure all of those services are onboard to map through all of these scenarios so we're very prepared if people come to the emergency room needing to be assessed, if people need to be admitted from the emergency room, if we have a number of patients admitted to hospital. We've made preparations for those scenarios.   We've been sitting down fairly regularly going through the planning of what's happening today and what could happen tomorrow and what the worst case scenario could look like for Hamilton at St. Joe's.   From Johanne Guilbault on Facebook: Can you get re-infected? It's a good question and the answer isn't necessarily out there yet. What's really remarkable about this infection is the amount of scientific literature and progress that's being made in such a short interval for this infection. It is very different than SARS or what was going on with the influenza pandemic in 2009. There are reports of people having the virus a few weeks after originally being diagnosed. It's really unclear whether or not that's a re-infection or it's the person who's just shedding the virus for a long time and whether or not they're even infectious at that point.  The jury is still out on if you could be re infected. The literature will come from China and Singapore and those areas of the world that have been heavily affected as they have more experience with this. Are masks effective? For health care workers assessing patients I think masks are obviously a value. You're dealing with someone that's actively ill.  For people that are caring for infected patients like a household contact in isolation, masks are also pretty effective. In Canada we've only had about 20 cases in a population of 30 million. So, your odds of actually being exposed to one of those cases is probably the same odds as winning the lottery. Wearing a mask everyday, all day isn't necessarily going to offer you more benefit than washing your hands.    Putting a mask on and taking it off is actually not a simple procedure. And as we all know, we touch your face many times a day. If you take your mask off incorrectly and it has actually been exposed to the virus or any other virus that's circulating you're actually taking what's on that surface of that mask and putting it back on your face. You're actually making the problem worse not better. So, again, for the average person they're not really at high risk. Doing things like hand hygiene and really making sure they're not touching their face is probably the biggest intervention for that from a public health standpoint. Making sure we identify cases is probably the other big intervention but wearing a mask around really doesn't reduce your risk  that much and, in fact, if you don't do it properly you might actually increase your risk. From April Almeida on Facebook: Is sanitizer as effective as soap and water washing? When you can't get to a sink, or traveling on plane? So, 20 seconds of hand washing with soap and water or using a hand sanitizer are entirely the same. Good, old fashioned, soap and water is effective. What makes hand hygiene the most effective is doing it properly. So, making sure you touch all those surfaces on your hands and spending the time doing it.  The areas of the hands that get missed, particularly, are these areas behind the thumbs where, if you're scrubbing like that, you're not really touching those areas. So, whatever you use is fine as long as you're doing it properly.   How long do you think it will be until this virus is under control? It's a million dollar question.  We're not near control today. Most of our federal agencies including the Health Minister, yesterday, had said you know there is a good eventuality that this may come to Canada and that we need to be prepared for it. In China, about two or three weeks ago, we were reporting 800 to 1,000 new cases a day. If you look at the stats from yesterday there was 115 new cases reported. It's a significant drop off in China. So, there are signs of positivity. So I think it's gonna be an interesting couple of months to see what happens. But the scenario is there are some signs that the scenarios are getting better.

  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals.

Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"

(Submitted by Shuwei Zhu) How the pandemic gives some states political cover for controversial acts For many governments, the pandemic crisis presents the perfect cover for carrying out actions they could only dream of before the virus struck. Around the time people first started falling ill in Hubei province, the Communist Party of China was wrestling with the difficult question of how to respond to voters in Hong Kong massively rejecting pro-Beijing candidates in local elections. Last Saturday, with the COVID-19 pandemic now a global concern, China's new top official in Hong Kong arrested 15 major pro-democracy figures. \"They've been wanting to make these arrests for a long time,\" said Lynette Ong, who teaches political science at the University of Toronto's Asian Institute. \"They know the rest of the world's attention is on coronavirus.\" In Hungary, debate was muted when Prime Minister Viktor Orban proposed a new law that would suspend parliament, stop all elections and allow him to rule by decree that his party-dominated parliament later passed. Orban said the measure was necessary to allow the government to act swiftly to \"save lives\" in a pandemic, but given Orban's history of methodically dismantling Hungary's democracy and institutions, most human rights groups predict his new powers will be used against anyone who criticizes the government's handling of the pandemic. Many governments have introduced new restrictions on speech in the name of combatting \"misinformation\" about the novel coronavirus. (The Trudeau government also has flirted with the idea.) In many cases, the \"misinformation\" governments are concerned about is anything that calls into question their own responses to the pandemic. In Turkmenistan, a hermetic police state dominated by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's cult of personality, saying the word \"coronavirus\" or wearing a mask in public can lead to arrest, according to Reporters Without Borders.

A team of Canadian scientists are leading research on how it could be treated. 2:01 IN BRIEF Trudeau announces $1.1B scientific strategy to fight COVID-19 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1-billion strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19. The plan has three components:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19.   Trudeau also announced the creation of a new COVID-19 immunity task force focused on serology testing — blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus. Trudeau said the task force will work to determine how many people have COVID-19 beyond those who already have been tested, whether those who've recovered are immune and, if so, how long that immunity might last. Today's measures support previous efforts by the Trudeau government to marshal Canada's scientific community in the battle against COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests and treatments to limit the disease and, ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide.

Phase 1 will see restrictions lifted on certain medical practices — including dentistry, optometry, physical therapy and more — alongside a focus on outdoor recreation. Phase 2, set to begin May 19, will include the opening of retail businesses and personal services not initially allowed under Saskatchewan's state of emergency. Dates for the other phases are still pending. Businesses are expected to continue practising physical distancing and implement screening measures if physical distancing is not possible. Long-term restrictions on high-risk areas remain in place, including maintaining the current state of emergency and recommendations against non-essential international and interprovincial travel. Read more about the five-phase plan  No more middle seats? Airlines ponder new normal of flying Airlines like United, Delta, EasyJet and others have announced plans to do away with the middle seat in their economy class cabins during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's the latest move in the aviation industry's attempts to deal with the coronavirus, which has walloped this industry harder than perhaps any other. While sure to be welcomed by economy class passengers who have spent years squeezed into smaller and smaller spaces, the promise to no longer get stuck in a middle seat is largely symbolic, as the number of flights around the world has plummeted by 70 per cent since the start of the crisis, says the International Air Transport Association (IATA). But how long will it last? The industry as a whole is clearly looking ahead to the future of air travel once the crisis passes, but not all airlines are entertaining the notion that it's feasible to get rid of middle seats. Irish discount airline RyanAir is able to offer rock-bottom prices precisely because it crams in as many passengers as possible, and CEO Michael O'Leary said the idea of keeping middle seats permanently empty is \"nonsense.\" Read more about airlines' plans amid the pandemic   THE SCIENCE Can I contract the virus in a swimming pool? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Experts say it is unlikely someone can become infected with the coronavirus by swimming in a pool. \"There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in pools that are properly monitored and treated\" with routine measures like chlorine and bromine, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, infectious disease clinician and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. The risk of transmission is from inhaling droplets produced from coughing, sneezing or talking — all of which require people being relatively close to each other. \"It's not so much the pool that gives the risk of transmission,\" said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners, but \"rather, being in close proximity to someone else who may be infected.\" The water itself would not be a risk in transmission, he added. However, health officials are still recommending that people physically distance and stay home as much as possible. As well, public pools are closed and most condo boards have also closed their amenities to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. AND FINALLY... This man has 3D-printed almost 700 face shields for health-care workers across Ontario Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont. , said he wanted to find some way to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, so he took to his 3D printer and began mass producing face shields. (Submitted by Lucas K. Labrecque) After seeing news stories highlighting the dangers of coronavirus, as well as the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain communities, Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont., started 3D-printing medical face shields in the hope of distributing them to front-line care workers. Using a technique called stack printing, the freelance television producer said he was able to mass produce stacks of face shield bands that can be taken apart and assembled with ease. Once the bands have been printed, he simply uses plastic book covers to serve as the protective component. Labrecque said he reaches out directly to the health-care workers who need PPE most, which he's able to do thanks to a network of friends and other contacts he's been able to make. So far, he's delivered almost 700 face shields to staff in Chatham, Blenheim, Woodstock, Hamilton, Lindsay, Bobcaygeon, Ottawa and parts of the Haldimand-Dunnville-Niagara region.

  Ottawa is giving $23 million to VIDO-InterVac in Saskatoon. The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre is based at the University of Saskatchewan. Half of the money is earmarked to build a pilot-scale manufacturing plant on campus to accelerate vaccine development. \"The $12 million enables us to build the facility to good manufacturing practices standards as required for human vaccine production,\" said VIDO-InterVac director Volker Gerdts. \"We expect to begin vaccine production in a little more than a year.\"   Go inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine    There is currently no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. VIDO-InterVac is the first lab in the country to have a vaccine candidate in animal testing. The vaccine was made in February, and researchers expect to know in about four weeks whether the vaccine works in an animal model. Clinical testing of this vaccine in humans could start as early as this fall. The balance of the money will go to operational funding for high-containment laboratories. 
  Saskatchewan has started talking about how to get some industries back in business, but many have had to adapt to continue operating in the age of COVID-19.   Some Regina businesses have taken a creative approach to safely reach customers and stay afloat. Tim Schultz runs Local and Fresh and Local Market, which includes a hyper-local grocery store, eatery and event centre. He stocks baked goods, meats and produce from greenhouses year round along with prepared foods like frozen pizzas from Ogema and homemade perogies.   Tim Schultz, co-owner and CEO of Local and Fresh, kneels in front of his brick and mortar location which opened in Regina's warehouse district about a year ago. You can no longer go in and browse, but you can get an employee to shop for you and do pickup or delivery.   (Matthew Howard/CBC) You can no longer browse around, but you can go in and ask for items or get your grocery order delivered. Schultz already had the infrastructure set up, having started deliveries five years ago. Once he opened a brick and mortar location  the delivery service wasn't as popular, but demand has skyrocketed because of the coronavirus.   Right now is the time to just encourage each other and to just help each other get through this.- Tim Schultz, owner, Local and Fresh Schultz said they've been at capacity many days, with up to five deliveries per hour from 7:30 a.m until 8 p.m. He said he started his business because of his passion for the local economy and local producers.   All of the products are grown or prepared in Saskatchewan or other parts of Western Canada. COVID-19 in Sask: Top doc says physical distancing must continue until there is vaccine or immunity Schultz said he's been impressed with the community's support for local businesses, including his own, during the pandemic. He encourages people to find out how companies have pivoted and keep doing what they can to support them.   \"As a small business owner myself , every order that comes through is kind of like a pat on the back and an encouragement not only to us as the owners, but to our staff, that the community is just encouraging us to keep going,\ " Schultz said. \"Right now is the time to just encourage each other and to just help each other get through this.\ " Premier Scott Moe says the province is coming up with a plan to get some industries back in business but for the time being, many have had to adapt to continue operating in the age of COVID-19. 4:40 Restaurants update operations 'just to survive' Just two days after Premier Scott Moe called a provincial state of emergency on March 18, restaurants were required to halt dine-in service. Most now offer takeout, delivery or curbside pickup. ZamZam Wraps had to temporarily close its location in the Cornwall Centre, but has introduced special deals hoping to drum up business at their east location. Manager Hussein Nahle said it's also a way for them to make their food more affordable at a time when many people are facing financial hardship. \"We are navigating the unknown,\" said Nahle. \"So it's very hard. We have to put in more plans just to survive.\" Hussein Nahle, store manager of ZamZam Wraps, says the restaurant has been rolling out special 'stay home' specials for delivery in hopes of drumming up business and making food affordable for people during the pandemic.   (Matthew Howard/CBC) Nahle said they sanitize and clean the counters and debit machines after each customer and are even washing the money that comes in and out of the till.   Quarantine happy hour You can now also get beverages right to your door. Pile O' Bones Brewing Co. has set up an online portal called Sask Beer Delivery. The bar and restaurant attached to the brewery on Saskatchewan Drive in Regina had to close, so bartenders have become drivers.   Valgardson and his team created the online portal Sask Beer Delivery and is now delivering beverages from 14 other breweries, a number of distilleries, wineries and one kombucha company in Saskatoon and Regina.   (Matthew Howard/CBC) In Regina, they do up to 150 deliveries a day between the hours of 5 and 8 p.m. CST. The service is also going in Saskatoon.   Sask. researchers team up with local companies to make hand sanitizer Owner Glenn Valgardson teamed up with 14 other breweries, several distilleries, some wineries and one kombucha company to deliver beverages made all over the province.   On top of that, Valgardson and others under the Craft Brewers Association have brewed a new beer, with plans to give 100 per cent of the proceeds from its sales to breweries directly affected by COVID-19.   \"With all the breweries in the province of Saskatchewan we all have a very collaborative effort,\ " Valgardson said. \"We're very friendly with each other. It would kind of be like seeing your neighbour go bankrupt.   \"You'd do anything to help them.\ " Valgarsdson said 70 per cent of his business came from selling kegs wholesale to bars and restaurants. With those closed he said he's had to lay off half his staff. He said he doesn't qualify for government subsidies because the bar opened less than a year ago. He said he's sent letters to local government and the Prime Minister's office and is waiting to hear back.   Turning to music in a difficult time Since people are not supposed to leave their homes, many music teachers have switched to online lessons.    Music is a great stress reliever.- Matt Cudmore, performace director, School of Rock Regina School of Rock Regina performance director Matt Cudmore said teachers can't really jam with students because of the lag, but it's been the perfect time to focus on music theory. Students at School of Rock Regina are taking their time off from school to practice their instruments and connect via Zoom.   (Facebook/School of Rock Regina) With kids out of school, they have more time to practise. One of his guitar students learned an entire Alice In Chains album in a week.   \"Music is a great stress reliever. Whenever I'm feeling angry or upset in any way that's immediately what I'm going to do is play music,\" said Cudmore. \"Pretty much everyone's at home right now with a bunch of time on their hands you know obviously you can binge watch some series on Netflix but why not pick up an instrument as well.\ " At-home workout has whole new meaning Exercise is another common stress reliever. All the gyms in the province are closed to the public now, but many are helping their clients work out at home.   Villains Strength & Conditioning teamed up with other local businesses right away to post free workouts online on multiple Facebook pages. It has also created an online virtual program, with live video workouts and free nutrition plans for members.   Villains Strength & Conditioning members are now working out live through an online video platform. The gym moved their membership online when their new location in Harbour Landing was mandated to temporarily close because of COVID-19.   (Facebook/Villains Strength & Conditioning) Manager Julie Baldock said it's not a good time to focus on losing weight, but she is encouraging people to set a routine and keep up with physical activity. \"Working out isn't always about getting those chiseled arms or those six packs. It's often about just feeling good, honouring your body and your mental health,\ " Baldock said. \"We wanted to try and reach out to as many people as we can and just say, this is something you can do in your house. Don't worry. Don't feel trapped. We got you.\" How some Sask. liquor stores are faring during the COVID-19 pandemic The gym opened its new location in Regina's south end one week before it was forced to shut down. Owner Brendan Kozack said he's taken a financial hit, but he's more worried about what comes after the pandemic, with people having lost income and likely being uneasy in crowds.   Working out isn't always about getting those chiseled arms or those six packs. It's often about just feeling good, honouring your body and your mental health.- Julie Baldock, manager, Villains Strength & Conditioning \"What's this going to look like three to six months immediately after we're done this kind of quarantine phase and we're kind of getting back into the swing of things and and businesses are kind of back open and stuff like that?\" he said. \"It's going to be vastly different and we're talking about people that got laid off and perhaps didn't get hired back on. There's going to be a large hit.\ " Premier Scott Moe is expected to release details on reopening Saskatchewan later this week.   He said that plan will likely start with more businesses being deemed essential, but it might not happen for weeks or months.

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   When the story of the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) is finally written, it might well become a template for the utopian dream of open science — where research data is shared freely, unrestrained by competition, paywalls and patents.   Already the world knows more about the early days of this outbreak than it did when SARS first appeared in China in 2002, as scientists unite in unprecedented scientific collaboration aimed at containing and treating this disease. As detailed accounts of the first cases have been published in prominent medical journals, it's clear that scientists were among the first responders at hospitals in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak.   One patient, a 49-year-old woman, was a merchant at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. In late December, she developed a fever and a cough and had an uncomfortable sensation in her chest. After four days, the cough became serious enough that she went to the hospital where a CT scan revealed she had pneumonia. The same day that she was admitted to a Wuhan hospital, a 61-year-old man arrived with similar symptoms. He was a frequent visitor to the Huanan market and had been suffering from a fever and a cough for a week before showing up at the hospital. He was so sick that he needed mechanical ventilation to breathe.   As doctors struggled to treat what was still an unknown illness, a team of scientists arrived from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. They collected fluid from deep in the patients' lungs and carefully placed them in sterile cups to begin the process of isolating the unknown virus believed to be causing this atypical pneumonia.   What on Earth?Infectious diseases and climate change : Is there a connection?WHO declares coronavirus outbreak an international emergency The woman survived, and she has been released from hospital. The man died. But their lung samples provided some of the earliest glimpses of a new and deadly human pathogen.   The ultrastructural morphology exhibited by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, is seen in an illustration released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Wednesday.   (Alissa Eckert/Dan Higgins/MAM/CDC/Reuters) Within days, those scientists and several others had sequenced the viral genome, deciphering the virus's genetic code — a vital key to diagnosing and ultimately treating the disease. They immediately shared that critical genetic roadmap with researchers all over the world. That early collaboration allowed doctors in other countries to be ready when the first cases appeared outside China.   Watching the virus mutate in real time   Because the viral genomes had been publicly released, when a  65-year-old man and his 27-year-old son were admitted to a hospital in  Vietnam on Jan. 22, doctors there were able to identify the virus, isolate the patients , backtrack their travel history and monitor 28 close contacts, none of whom have developed symptoms. By then evolutionary biologist Trevor Bedford had already used the growing database of viral genomes to conclude this virus made the leap from animals to humans sometime in mid-November, an astonishingly precise estimate that helped scientists understand how long the virus had been infecting people.   \"In looking at the genomes that were coming in from Wuhan, we could see that there was very little genetic diversity,\ " said Bedford, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle, Wash. The low number of mutations not only told him the virus was new in humans, it also corrected an early misunderstanding and revealed that the virus was spreading easily between humans.   \"As soon as the first genomes were coming in, it became clear that there's lots of human-to-human spread,\ " he said.   The availability of having a full genome sequence of a novel virus available to the public to be able to develop diagnostics, to be able to diagnose patients in other countries is unprecedented.- Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO infectious disease epidemiologist The genome data also allowed some groups to quickly zero in on the animal source, by using the genetic data to link this virus to one found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Just three weeks after the first viral sequence was published, more than 42 different genomes are available on Nextstrain, an open source viral genome database that continues to grow as scientists diagnose patients and publish the viral genomes in just a few days.   Evolutionary biologist Trevor Bedford used the growing database of viral genomes to conclude the coronavirus made the leap from animals to humans sometime in mid-November, an astonishingly precise estimate that helped scientists understand how long the virus had been infecting people. (Robert Hood/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) That data is allowing Bedford to watch the virus mutate in real time, making it possible to identify how people became infected and which cases are linked. It also provides critical data to allow other scientists to estimate the size of the epidemic. Other groups are using the genetic data to develop rapid diagnostic tests and begin working on antiviral drugs. And already at least five different groups have started working on a possible vaccine, including one from Saskatchewan.    Go inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses  \"The availability of having a full genome sequence of a novel virus available to the public to be able to develop diagnostics, to be able to diagnose patients in other countries is unprecedented,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the World Health Organization (WHO) news conference on Wednesday.   Sharing virus samples 'essential': WHO On Tuesday, Australia announced that its scientists are the first outside China to grow the novel virus and will share it with the world. \"It is essential that viruses are shared so that the further development of diagnostics and serologic assays  —  so that the further development of vaccines — can continue,\" said Van Kerkhove. Part of the first genetic sequence of the coronavirus was released to the world on Jan. 10.    (GenBank by Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health, Fudan University) To keep on top of the rapidly breaking science, medical and scientific journals agreed to send copies of coronavirus papers to WHO before publication, with the authors' permission. WHO announced this development in a tweet with the headline, \"Great news!\ " \"That is a little different,\" said Edward Campion, executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"The WHO wants to know what's going on in China and have asked us to help in getting information.\ " The journal also announced that it is speeding up its peer review.    \"Some of these articles have been reviewed and edited and revised in 48 or even 24 hours, including working overnight and weekends but still going through rigorous peer review to meet the standards that we think are important,\" said Campion.  \"We have some peer reviewers who've agreed to work overtime.\" On Friday, 67 leading research organizations and scientific journal publishers from around the world announced an agreement to make relevant coronavirus research immediately available and free. Bedford said the current climate of sharing is unusual for scientists. \"You don't really talk externally that much because you're trying to get your best science so it can't be scooped,\ " he said. \"You only really talk about things once it's all been published. This is flipping that around entirely where people are just being completely open with what they know.\"  University of Montreal researcher Vincent   Larivière said the current climate of open science suggests that science-as-usual creates barriers.     (Amélie Philibert) It's a temporary glimpse of a world where science is openly shared.  But the measures also raise questions about the way science-as-usual is practised. Vincent Larivière is an information scientist and professor at the University of Montreal, who studies the way science is disseminated. He said the move to speed up publication and share research is a tacit admission that business-as-usual in research slows down science. \"[They say] we're opening everything because it's important that we advance things fast. Well, the flip side of this argument is that your normal behaviour is to put barriers to science.\" \"This virus is dangerous and deadly, but there's lots of other diseases that are dangerous and deadly, and for which opening could save lives. So if you really want to go in that direction, just open everything.\"    To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, please subscribe. 
  Alberta researchers are hopeful that an antiviral drug engineered to treat the deadly Ebola virus will prove a viable treatment in the ongoing fight against the coronavirus. The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies began enrolling patients in early March. Gilead Sciences — an American biotechnology company with a production facility in Edmonton — developed the drug in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed that several other treatments were more effective against Ebola and remdesivir was discontinued as a treatment. However, testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. ' A very potent compound' The first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States received remdesivir for compassionate use, which allows the use of an unapproved drug to treat a seriously-ill patient when no other treatments are available. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit and received the drug on the seventh day of illness. The next day the patient showed a marked improvement and his symptoms eventually disappeared altogether. If proven effective, remdesivir would be one of the few available remedies for a respiratory illness which has killed thousands of people around the world.   Anecdotal evidence and promising results in animals trials make the drug a strong candidate for clinical trials, said Matthias Götte, chair of the medical microbiology and immunology department at the University of Alberta. Götte has been working with his team to find out how the drug may be used to treat coronaviruses. An attack from the inside His study, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in late February, was among the first in Canada to examine the COVID-19 strain, and explore why remdesivir might be an effective treatment. \"We know the drug works against different coronaviruses, like MERS and SARS, and we know the novel coronavirus is very similar to SARS,\" Götte said. \"The pre-clinical data looked very good. It was a very potent compound so we were interested in the actual mechanism, how that drug actually works against Ebola. \"We created a synthetic version of this enzyme and, in a test tube, we were able to study the mechanism of remdesivir against this Ebola target.\ "   Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world Wednesday   Götte's research shows that the drug stops the virus from replicating. It disrupts the viruses biochemistry by masquerading as a part of the virus itself.    \"Remdesivir essentially mimics one of the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis necessary for genome replication of the virus,\ " Götte said. \"Enzymes within the virus are synthesizing the viral RNA genome with these building blocks, but they mix up the bits they need with the drug. Once the drug is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the virus can no longer replicate.\"   Last week, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will begin this month in countries across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers.   This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.- Matthias Gotte. Götte said no matter the results of the studies, his team will continue to examine how the drug interacts with the new virus. The results of the clinical trial will be only the first step in finding an effective treatment, and one drug will likely not be enough.    \"Ideally, we will have a couple of drugs because certain strains could be resistant to certain treatments,\ " Götte said.

Health Canada had also been considering special access requests for the drug on a patient-by-patient basis. \"In recent weeks, there has been an exponential increase in compassionate-use requests for emergency access to remdesivir, related to the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States,\" reads the statement from Gilead. \"This has flooded an emergency-treatment-access system that was set up for very limited access to investigational medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic.\"  'A fundamental shift': Nearly half of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada now from community spread
  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the new coronavirus an emergency of \"international concern\" on Jan. 30, after it was first reported from Wuhan, China, late last year.  Canadian officials stress that the risk of contracting the virus in this country remains low. But Canadians are worried and want information about the disease.   Here are the latest developments:   China on Wednesday reported another drop in the number of new cases of the viral infection and 97 more deaths, pushing the total dead past 1,100. The illness has a new name: COVID-19. Despite the official end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday, many businesses in China remain closed. Japan's health ministry has confirmed 174 cases aboard Carnival Corp.'s Diamond Princess, which is docked in Yokohama.     What is a coronavirus?   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness, including the common cold, pneumonia, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19, the illness at the centre of the current outbreak.   The group responsible for classifying and naming viruses has tentatively called the virus  2019-nCoV— not to be confused with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. WATCH | A short video answering many of the main questions:  Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness?

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe respiratory problems, kidney failure and even death.    Read more about the symptoms here Are your kids worried about the coronavirus?

This story explains what you should do to avoid spreading the infection to anyone else as you seek medical help.   Preventing the spread According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, coronaviruses are most commonly spread by:   Coughing or sneezing. Close personal contact, such as shaking hands. Touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.    To prevent infection:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.

(Bonnie Allen/CBC) One of the main ways scientists can figure out how to prevent the spread of an infectious disease is to zero in on its animal host and how it jumped from that animal to a person.

In Quebec, Premier François Legault said for the good of children, especially those with learning difficulties, the province is moving forward with a plan to begin reopening schools.   In his daily briefing Monday, the premier said five or six months without attending school could pose serious, long-term risks for many children. \"Life must go on,\" he said. A closed schoolyard is seen through its fence in Montreal on Monday. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press) Elementary schools and daycares will begin reopening on May 11 outside of Montreal and on May 19 on the island of Montreal. All other schools — high schools, colleges and universities — won't reopen until late August. But Legault said that timeline will depend on the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 remaining stable. There are now 1,541 people in hospital — an increase of 23 over Sunday. Some 210 patients are in intensive care, down five from yesterday.   WATCH | Legault details plans to reopen schools: Premier François Legault says elementary schools and childcare centres outside Montreal are expected to open May 11, though attendance will not be mandatory. High schools, CEGEPs and universities will remain closed. 1:06 Eighty-four more deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours. Of those, 79 were residents of long-term-care homes, or CHSLDs. The premier has spent the past several weeks pleading with various medical professions for help, especially in those besieged CHSLDs. He said that a critical short-staffing situation is beginning to ease. \"It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders,\ " Legault said at the government's daily news conference. A man brings in supplies to a seniors residence in Montreal on Monday. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) In Ontario, the government announced it will reopen the province's economy through a three-stage process in the coming weeks and months, though it offered no firm date and few details about when that effort will begin.   Health and safety \"will continue to be a top priority as Ontario transitions to a 'new normal,'\" a government document unveiled Monday afternoon said. A Framework for Reopening our Province emphasizes that public health officials will have input during each phase of the process. According to the province, the stages are as follows:   Stage 1: Open select workplaces and allow some small gatherings. Stage 2: Open more workplaces and outdoor spaces and allow some larger gatherings. Stage 3: Further relax restrictions on public gatherings and open all workplaces \"responsibly.\ "  WATCH | Ford moves cautiously to reopen economy: Doug Ford says the province has 'flattened the curve' against COVID-19 but warns the timing to allow businesses to reopen still depends on some strict criteria. 0:57 Each stage will last at least two to four weeks, at which point Ontario's chief medical officer of health will be able to tighten certain restrictions, extend the stage or advise that the province can move into the next phase. While there are no specific dates included in the planning document, when and how Ontario begins reopening will depend on a number of factors, including:   A consistent two-to-four week drop in new daily COVID-19 cases. A decrease in cases that can't be traced to a source. A decrease in new hospitalizations.   Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said last week that the province would need to see fewer than 200 new cases daily for an extended stretch before relaxing COVID-19 emergency measures. With the province still falling somewhat short of its goal of processing 13,000 tests per day, whether the number of new cases being reported daily reflects the true number of new infections remains a question.

You can retrospectively say yes, absolutely, you could screen more, or you could change your stance. But at the time we had very, very few cases globally and in Canada,\" Tam said. Wage subsidy program opens Monday also marks the first day that eligible businesses can apply for Ottawa's $73-billion wage subsidy program. The federal government initially proposed a 10 per cent wage subsidy for eligible workers, but after criticism from businesses and the opposition, the government boosted the subsidy to 75 per cent of wages, offering up to $847 a week. Businesses that can are being urged to top workers up and cover the remaining 25 per cent. The first payments should begin to arrive as soon as May 7, Trudeau said at his daily briefing on Monday.

  We're answering your questions about the pandemic. Send yours to COVID@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday online, and also put some questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network.  So far we've received more than 20,000 emails from all corners of the country. Can the coronavirus spread from a dead body? Fran J. sent this question about whether the virus can jump from the dead to the living. Right now, Health Canada has no clear answer, but here's what we do know: SARS-CoV-2 (the proper name for the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19) can remain infectious on different surfaces for varying amounts of time.   \"So, it would be possible that the virus could persist and remain infectious in or on the body of someone who has died,\" says Dr. Ilan Schwartz, infectious disease specialist and assistant professor at the University of Alberta.   During the first SARS outbreak in 2003, data suggested the virus could remain infectious in bodily fluids such as blood, urine and feces for 72 to 96 hours, says Jason Kindrachuk, microbiologist and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba.   What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory \"This doesn't perfectly mimic what happens in a person, but it gives us some ideas on how stable coronaviruses are in different bodily fluids and may give some information on SARS-CoV-2,\ " Kindrachuk said. This means it is still possible for someone who handles or touches a body infected with the virus to also become infected, says Schwartz. Patrick Curry, the acting president of Nova Scotia's Funeral Service Association tells CBC News \"Things have changed quite drastically.\ " He adds it is important to care for people who have lost loved ones, but also stay away from them physically.   Funeral services, especially rituals that call for the body to be washed and shrouded, are adapting to the pandemic. Is it safer to use the self check-out or the cashier? This great question comes from Alice in Ottawa.   \"Although self-check out allows you to distance from others, it also requires touching more surfaces,\" says Siyun Wang, associate professor of food safety engineering at the University of British Columbia's Faculty of Land and Food Systems. But Wang says the risk of infection at the grocery store is low, if you \"go where there are fewer people and shop efficiently, because person-to-person contact is the number one concern.\ " She also says it's good to minimize the amount of time you spend in the store and to use a touchless payment method. Jeffrey Farber, director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety and a professor at the University of Guelph adds: \"In both cases, consumers should be wiping their hands with a disinfectant wipe before they leave the store at the exit, and then again when they come home, and again after they put the groceries away when they get home.\ "   He also reminds everyone to wash their hands before they eat.

Rebecca T. is wondering whether she and her family could have been infected with the coronavirus. She says they all had a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Our COVID@cbc.ca inbox is flooded with similar questions. Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease physician in Edmonton, says it's \"not impossible\ " her family had COVID-19.   \"But at the same time we were in the throes of a really bad flu season [in December and January] so it's a pretty high likelihood it was influenza.   \"Now people who had a compatible illness during the period that COVID was around would be possibly able to be tested to see if they have antibodies against the infection, which would document whether you'd previously been infected or not.\ " CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? All provinces are looking at how we might start using that testing once it's available, she adds. \"So the answer is that some people might be able to find out if they'd been infected even if they didn't have a swab, but not quite yet.\"  For more, watch the CBC special COVID-19 in Canada. How long does someone who is asymptomatic remain contagious? New research suggests asymptomatic carriers are adding to the spread of the virus. This means you don't have to feel sick, to make others sick. How long is a \"silent spreader\" contagious? This is a tough question because, without symptoms, it is very difficult to determine whether someone actually has the virus unless they're tested. Right now, some provinces and territories are testing for asymptomatic carriers among health-care providers and those who live in long-term care homes. Why it's so difficult to get tested for COVID-19 in Canada That's one of the reasons why Health Canada is recommending a 14-day self-isolation for anyone who believes they may have been exposed to the coronavirus. \"This is a sneaky virus,\" said Health Minister Patty Hajdu.   \"Some people don't feel ill at all. And that's why… physical distancing is so critically important. We have to act as if we are all carrying this virus.\" COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms were about half as infectious as symptomatic ones, according to Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University in New York, who examined China's outbreak.  But because they felt fine, they travelled and infected more people.  Read more about asymptomatic transmission research.

 Inmates at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary say they have been protesting COVID-19 measures that are keeping some in cells for 20 hours a day but do not enforce physical distancing among inmates or require guards to wear masks or gloves at all times.   Prisoners and worried family members across Canada have started speaking out about their concerns as the number of COVID-19 cases behind bars exceeds 175.   The first COVID-19 death of an inmate in Canada was announced by Correctional Service Canada last Thursday. The inmate had been at the Mission Institute in British Columbia, where 60 people had tested positive for the virus by April 19.    No COVID-19 cases have been reported at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary in Prince Albert, which has capacity to hold more than 500 inmates. But Anthony Slippery, who is in the medium security section of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, said increased cell time and isolation to avoid the spread of COVID-19 is affecting mental health. Union urges Ottawa and province to release non-violent inmates from jails and prisons \"It 's pretty much like a death trap. We're pretty much sitting, waiting … it's a lot of what ifs, and a lot of this and that, a lot of worries. And then we got to go back in our cells and worry about this stuff,\ " he said.   Slippery has been in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary since 2012 for two counts of assault causing bodily harm.   Slippery said it can take days to access a counsellor and inmates can be reluctant to put in a request because leaving the unit can raise suspicions that person is being a \"rat\" — sharing information with authority figures.      In the immediate term obviously the bigger concern is that we don't have an outbreak.- Shawn Fraser, John Howard Society He and two other inmates at the facility told CBC that concerns about the virus entering the prison are causing tension between inmates and guards, who the inmates believe should be required to wear masks at all times.   Guards do not have to wear masks unless they are required to get closer than two metres away from inmates.   \"They're putting us at risk ... because they're the ones going out into society and we're not in a public place,\" said Slippery. \"There's a lot of guys worried here, you know, [about] catching it, because once it comes into the institution here it's just going to go like wildfire.\" 'Peaceful protests'   Slippery said inmates who do not have jobs, or whose jobs are on hold, are being kept in their cells for 20 hours per day. He said the same inmates would usually spend more than 12 hours out of their cells during the day.   Slippery and others said inmates have held \"peaceful\" protests about spending more time in their cells.  He said groups of inmates have refused to \"lock up\" and made efforts to disrupt guard's attempts to count inmates.   Correctional Service Canada said it has implemented a modified daily routine to reduce the risk of an outbreak at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary. \"It is not uncommon to have inmates or groups of inmates participate in peaceful protests where they do not agree with proposed changes to their routine,\ " it said.   How COVID-19 is changing Sask. courts and jails \"But we are certainly not aware of any mass/aggressive activity in all of these instances, discussions occur as a means to resolve and determine next steps.\" CSC said the modified routine for COVID-19 was developed in conjunction with inmate representatives.   \"It allows inmates access to a number of activities including indoor movement, access to fresh air, access to telephones, showers, meals and laundry facilities.\" \"The schedule, which has been in place for a number of weeks, has been communicated widely with the offender population and respects a number of guiding principles including elimination of large group activities, promotion of physical distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols.\" Inmates say guards should have to wear masks the whole time they are at work, not just when they are within two metres of an inmate.   (Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) It said ongoing \"solution-focused\" meetings are held between management and inmate representatives to provide updates and make adjustments where possible.   \"The modified routine provides inmates the opportunity to be out of their cells for a minimum of four hours per day and in some cases up to eight hours a day with a minimum of one hour access to fresh air outdoors,\" it said in a statement.   \"Some offenders continue to attend work in critical institutional employment areas such as food services and cleaning.\" Twenty hours a day is the maximum amount of time an inmate is allowed to be in their cell if they are in solitary confinement, now known as Structured Intervention Units. Slippery said inmates can still play cards and be close to each other when they are outside of their cells.   Preventing an outbreak is the priority: Inmate advocate Shawn Fraser is the CEO of inmate advocacy group, the John Howard Society of Saskatchewan. He said that although it is difficult for inmates to spend more time in their cells, it is warranted due to the seriousness of the risk of an outbreak.   \"It's unfortunate that prisoners have to stay in their cells for an extended period of time , that has the potential to have long-term effects,\" said Fraser.   \"But in the immediate term obviously the bigger concern is that we don't have an outbreak in a Saskatchewan institution, which we're ripe for right now.   Edmonton Institution inmate alleges abuse behind bars during pandemic \"We hope it doesn't happen but it would not be shocking to me at all if we did hear in the coming days that there was an outbreak in one of the institutions.\ "  Fraser thinks prisons should be taking all measures at their disposal to try to protect inmates from the virus. He said that includes having staff wear masks.   \"Prisons across this country represent one of the last institutions where we have huge groups of people gathering and the fact is that's a danger, not only to the people that are serving time but the people that are working in those prisons and actually for all of us,\" said Fraser.     \"We've been lucky so far, especially in Saskatchewan, that we haven't seen a big spike in cases but where those spikes in cases will come from most likely will be in our prison system.\" Inmates say guards should wear masks Bronson Gordon, who is in the maximum security section of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, said inmates feel guards should carry more responsibility for ensuring there is no outbreak at the facility.   \"They're taking all of our privileges away though,\" said Gordon.   \"That's why we're getting upset, because why are you punishing us? Why are you taking away all of our privileges? Why are you giving us only four and a half hours out of our cell when you guys can't even wear a mask and gloves and you guys aren't using hand sanitizers?\"' CSC said it has provided guidance to staff on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Sask. judge releases 69-year-old from jail over fears of COVID-19 \"Also, for anyone working at one of our sites, CSC has issued guidance for working with an offender with either symptoms of, or who is diagnosed with, COVID-19,\ " it said in a statement. \"When they are providing care and will be within two (2) metres for an inmate, staff will put on gloves, a surgical/procedural mask, a face shield or eye goggles and a gown.\ " Of the three inmates CBC spoke to at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, all said they were not aware of any additional mental health supports being introduced for inmates who are now spending more time in their cells. Video visits have been introduced after in-person visits were cancelled in mid-March.   \"There's a lot of guys in there that have psychological or mental health issues,\ " said Gordon, who is serving a life sentence for first-degree murder over the 2015 death of Reno Lee. He has appealed his conviction. Some inmates at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary are spending more time in their cells due to COVID-19 measures introduced by CSC.    (Guy Quenneville/CBC) \"Some of them are suffering from not seeing their family. Some of them are just having anxiety over the pandemic and not and seeing guards, you know, wear their protective gear and stuff.\" \"You got a lot of people that are just scared.\" Worry about what's happening inside the institution has seeped into the outside world, as family members absorb the concerns of their loved ones.   Anthony Slippery's wife, Nicolle, said she wasn't able to contact her husband for three days last week because the phones in his unit were not working. \"So that kind of adds to the worry, like my worry, because OK he knows what's going on and he knows what the problem is but I don't,\ " she said. COVID-19 in Sask : Top doc says physical distancing must continue until there is vaccine or immunity \"I'm on this end and I'm like 'OK , well I know that a couple days ago the unit beside him was quarantined, you know. Is there something, someone [who has COVD-19]? Is it my husband? All of those things have gone through my mind over the last few days. \"Just to find out that it was something as small and as silly as just the phones not working.\ "  Friends and family of inmates at provincial correctional centres are also deeply worried about the potential for an outbreak in those facilities.   ' Every day I pray': Mom of Regina inmate Christine Morrissette's son Michael (Junior) Morrissette is on remand at the Regina Correctional Centre.   \"Every day I pray that my son does not become exposed to COVID-19,\" said Morrissette.   \"As a mother I wait for his phone call to make sure he's safe and healthy another day. And it's not easy for me to do that.\" Her son has been on remand since he was arrested on a second-degree murder charge in connection with the death of David Justin Lloyd Anderson in Regina on March 5.    \"I'm very leery about it and I'm very concerned about my son. He's only 21 years old and he does have health conditions so him being exposed to that could really put him in a bad situation,\ " she said. \"And I don't know if they even contact the person if he's been exposed to it.   \"Even though he is gone in for a crime he's a person too and everybody deserves a chance to be safe and healthy during this pandemic.\" New admissions quarantined Ministry of Justice spokesperson Noel Busse said there have not been any changes to the amount of time offenders are being kept in their cells at provincial facilities.   \"However, we have restricted movement and placement of offenders in our facilities as a precautionary measure to reduce any potential spread of COVID-19,\" he said in a written response to questions.   \"For example, all new admissions to provincial correctional facilities are quarantined for 14 days as a precautionary measure before being placed with the rest of the population in the facility.\" Staff at provincial correctional facilities are not required to wear masks at all times.   \"There may be certain instances where a staff member is required to use a mask or some other form of PPE while they are conducting specific duties,\" said Busse.  
  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"

Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  The majority of people in Saskatchewan should not be worried about coronavirus, according to the province's chief medical officer.   Dr. Saqib Shahab updated the situation Wednesday, noting that the Ministry of Health is watching the outbreak closely.   The novel coronavirus is believed to have started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It has resulted in more than 130 deaths and more than 6,000 people have been affected.   In Canada, Ontario has one confirmed case of the virus, with 19 people under investigation for possible infection, while B.C. health officials have reported one presumed case. Shahab said the Saskatchewan health line has been receiving calls, and testing has been ordered in five cases —  one has come back negative while the others are still pending. Shahab said it is likely the tests will be negative and those tested have influenza.   \"If you are a person on the street and you have not travelled [to China] , you should not be concerned,\ " Shahab said.   For people who have travelled from China, if they are asymptomatic they will be given advice and can continue on normally, Shahab said. If people have a fever or cough they should stay home, and if symptoms worsen they should call the medial helpline (811), Shahab said. People should monitor themselves for two weeks, he said.   A man wears a mask while walking in the street on Jan. 22 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.   (Getty Images) Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, tightness in the chest or shortness of breath, Shahab said. He said there can also be diarrhea, aches and pains — similar to influenza. People without symptoms are less infectious; if a person is very sick they are more infectious.   The province had a previous protocol for viruses like this, but it has now refocused to make sure that people declare their travel history, Shahab said. If needed, health officials will observe people for up to two weeks.   \"I think we're learning more and more as time goes on,\" he said. \"Only rarely does it become severe.\ "  Shahab said health officials have learned a lot since the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. SARS is a strain of coronavirus that killed hundreds of people, including 44 in Canada, and sickened thousands more.

I think over the next four to six weeks. We will see how the evolution is,\ " Shahab said.   CMO: Rumours on social media are untrue Shahab advised people to ignore rumours circulating on social media and look to health officials for accurate information.   Should there be a case of coronavirus detected in the province, it will be formally announced by health officials.   \"The internet and social media is a great gift for staying in touch with friends and family. But obviously, one has to be very careful about what information is out there.\" On Monday, Global Affairs Canada told Canadians to avoid travel to Hubei province due to transportation restrictions put in place by Chinese officials to try to stop the spread of the virus.   Coronavirus in Canada: What are the next steps to contain the disease here?PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In Saskatoon , scientists at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre are working to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.

Shuwei Zhu of Windsor, Ont., began drawing sidewalk murals near her home as a way of showing support for friends who are front-line and essential workers. (Submitted by Shuwei Zhu) How the pandemic gives some states political cover for controversial acts For many governments, the pandemic crisis presents the perfect cover for carrying out actions they could only dream of before the virus struck. Around the time people first started falling ill in Hubei province, the Communist Party of China was wrestling with the difficult question of how to respond to voters in Hong Kong massively rejecting pro-Beijing candidates in local elections. Last Saturday, with the COVID-19 pandemic now a global concern, China's new top official in Hong Kong arrested 15 major pro-democracy figures. \"They've been wanting to make these arrests for a long time,\" said Lynette Ong, who teaches political science at the University of Toronto's Asian Institute. \"They know the rest of the world's attention is on coronavirus.\" In Hungary, debate was muted when Prime Minister Viktor Orban proposed a new law that would suspend parliament, stop all elections and allow him to rule by decree that his party-dominated parliament later passed. Orban said the measure was necessary to allow the government to act swiftly to \"save lives\" in a pandemic, but given Orban's history of methodically dismantling Hungary's democracy and institutions, most human rights groups predict his new powers will be used against anyone who criticizes the government's handling of the pandemic. Many governments have introduced new restrictions on speech in the name of combatting \"misinformation\" about the novel coronavirus. (The Trudeau government also has flirted with the idea.) In many cases, the \"misinformation\" governments are concerned about is anything that calls into question their own responses to the pandemic. In Turkmenistan, a hermetic police state dominated by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's cult of personality, saying the word \"coronavirus\" or wearing a mask in public can lead to arrest, according to Reporters Without Borders.

A team of Canadian scientists are leading research on how it could be treated. 2:01 IN BRIEF Trudeau announces $1.1B scientific strategy to fight COVID-19 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1-billion strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19. The plan has three components:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19.   Trudeau also announced the creation of a new COVID-19 immunity task force focused on serology testing — blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus. Trudeau said the task force will work to determine how many people have COVID-19 beyond those who already have been tested, whether those who've recovered are immune and, if so, how long that immunity might last. Today's measures support previous efforts by the Trudeau government to marshal Canada's scientific community in the battle against COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests and treatments to limit the disease and, ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. Read more about the scientific strategy   Saskatchewan unveils 5-stage plan to reopen its economy in May The Saskatchewan government today unveiled its five-phase plan to reopen the province, with the first phase set to begin on May 4. \"Over the next several weeks, restrictions will be gradually lifted by adding more types of businesses to the allowable businesses list, meaning that they can reopen if they so choose,\" Premier Scott Moe said in a news release. Phase 1 will see restrictions lifted on certain medical practices — including dentistry, optometry, physical therapy and more — alongside a focus on outdoor recreation. Phase 2, set to begin May 19, will include the opening of retail businesses and personal services not initially allowed under Saskatchewan's state of emergency. Dates for the other phases are still pending. Businesses are expected to continue practising physical distancing and implement screening measures if physical distancing is not possible. Long-term restrictions on high-risk areas remain in place, including maintaining the current state of emergency and recommendations against non-essential international and interprovincial travel. Read more about the five-phase plan  No more middle seats? Airlines ponder new normal of flying Airlines like United, Delta, EasyJet and others have announced plans to do away with the middle seat in their economy class cabins during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's the latest move in the aviation industry's attempts to deal with the coronavirus, which has walloped this industry harder than perhaps any other. While sure to be welcomed by economy class passengers who have spent years squeezed into smaller and smaller spaces, the promise to no longer get stuck in a middle seat is largely symbolic, as the number of flights around the world has plummeted by 70 per cent since the start of the crisis, says the International Air Transport Association (IATA). But how long will it last? The industry as a whole is clearly looking ahead to the future of air travel once the crisis passes, but not all airlines are entertaining the notion that it's feasible to get rid of middle seats. Irish discount airline RyanAir is able to offer rock-bottom prices precisely because it crams in as many passengers as possible, and CEO Michael O'Leary said the idea of keeping middle seats permanently empty is \"nonsense.\" Read more about airlines' plans amid the pandemic   THE SCIENCE Can I contract the virus in a swimming pool? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Experts say it is unlikely someone can become infected with the coronavirus by swimming in a pool. \"There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in pools that are properly monitored and treated\" with routine measures like chlorine and bromine, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, infectious disease clinician and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. The risk of transmission is from inhaling droplets produced from coughing, sneezing or talking — all of which require people being relatively close to each other. \"It's not so much the pool that gives the risk of transmission,\" said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners, but \"rather, being in close proximity to someone else who may be infected.\" The water itself would not be a risk in transmission, he added. However, health officials are still recommending that people physically distance and stay home as much as possible. As well, public pools are closed and most condo boards have also closed their amenities to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. AND FINALLY... This man has 3D-printed almost 700 face shields for health-care workers across Ontario Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont. , said he wanted to find some way to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, so he took to his 3D printer and began mass producing face shields. (Submitted by Lucas K. Labrecque) After seeing news stories highlighting the dangers of coronavirus, as well as the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain communities, Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont., started 3D-printing medical face shields in the hope of distributing them to front-line care workers. Using a technique called stack printing, the freelance television producer said he was able to mass produce stacks of face shield bands that can be taken apart and assembled with ease. Once the bands have been printed, he simply uses plastic book covers to serve as the protective component. Labrecque said he reaches out directly to the health-care workers who need PPE most, which he's able to do thanks to a network of friends and other contacts he's been able to make. So far, he's delivered almost 700 face shields to staff in Chatham, Blenheim, Woodstock, Hamilton, Lindsay, Bobcaygeon, Ottawa and parts of the Haldimand-Dunnville-Niagara region.

  Canadian hospitals facing urgent COVID-19 needs are banding together to close funding \"gaps\" for their institutions and embattled health-care workers. Dubbed The Frontline Fund, the national campaign seeks donations on behalf of more than 100 institutions across the country for supplies, staff support and research. Organizers say the money would help hospitals source personal protective equipment and ventilators, fund drug trials and vaccine research and provide mental-health support to exhausted staff. Ten per cent of funds will also go toward the northern territories and Indigenous health. Steering committee member Caroline Riseboro, also CEO of the Trillium Health Partners Foundation, said COVID-19 has raised unique needs that \"wouldn't necessarily be addressed through government funding.\" WATCH | Go behind the scenes in a hospital: The National’s Adrienne Arsenault gets rare access inside a Toronto hospital during the global COVID-19 pandemic to see first-hand what staff are up against. Some of what our team saw and captured on camera may be difficult to watch. 9:56 Examples of how the money could be spent include extra scrubs so caregivers can change their clothes before going home or hotel rooms for front-line staff with immune-compromised relatives so they don't have to fear bringing the virus home with them. The three main ways relief will be distributed are:  Supplies: From personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, disinfectants and disposable clothing to life-saving ventilators and testing equipment to the digital infrastructure needed to enable virtual patient care, front-line health-care workers need more tools.   Supports: Being directly involved in patient care in a pandemic takes a huge toll. Gift cards and peer-to-peer mental health support will also help health-care workers protect their families, get much-needed rest and prepare themselves for the effort ahead.   Research: Hospitals need funding to conduct vital research like clinical drug trials to discover therapeutic breakthroughs and intense vaccine development efforts.   Organizers say $8.5 million has already been promised by lead corporate partners. That includes $5 million from the Canadian Medical Association Foundation, $2.5 million from Maple Leaf Foods and $1 million from TD Bank Group. ' Unprecedented crisis' The goal is to raise $50 million. Canadians can donate at www.frontlinefund.ca. \"All of our hospitals in Canada are just facing an unprecedented crisis here,\" Riseboro said.

It is historic in nature. Never have all of these hospitals across the country come together to fundraise in concert for what is probably one of the most significant health crises facing us in a generation.\ " Money will stay within the province in which it is donated and be allocated according to the number of beds at each institution. Each hospital foundation will decide how to spend the funds on its unique needs, said Riseboro. A health-care worker is seen outside the emergency department of the Vancouver General Hospital on March 30.

It's also setting up a $5-million fund to benefit community hospitals and giving another $5 million to a COVID-19 grant program by the Foundation for Advancing Family Medicine. Another $5 million will help medical students and residents with financial hardships, and $250,000 will go to Doctors without Borders' COVID-19 crisis fund. 
  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation.

John M. wants to know if he can have his kids and grandkids come over separately to swim in his private pool.   Experts say it is unlikely someone can become infected with the coronavirus by swimming in a pool.   \"There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in pools that are properly monitored and treated,\" with routine measures like chlorine and bromine, says Dr. Ilan Schwartz, infectious disease clinician and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Sunday The risk of transmission is from inhaling droplets produced from coughing, sneezing or talking — all of which require people being relatively close to each other.   \"It's not so much the pool that gives the risk of transmission,\" says Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners, but \"rather, being in close proximity to someone else who may be infected.\" The water itself would not be a risk in transmission, he adds. However, health officials are still recommending that we physically distance and stay home as much as possible, so John should wait until restrictions loosen before having his family over for pool time.    Right now, public pools are closed and most condo boards have also closed their amenities to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. But, as things start to gradually open, Chakrabarti predicts there will be restrictions put in place to limit how many people can be in a public pool at one time.   Is blood being screened for the coronavirus?   This is an interesting question from Lujane in London, Ont.  Canadian Blood Services (CBS) is not screening for the coronavirus, because evidence suggests it's not transmissible through blood and blood products.   \"We have not seen any case reports of transmission through blood transfusion,\" said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, associate professor of infectious disease medicine at the University of Alberta. \"So blood transfusion does not appear to be high-risk for transmission of COVID.\"  Lujane A. from London, Ont. is wondering if the Canadian Blood Services are screening for COVID-19. 0:14 However, some countries are beginning to screen blood in an effort to track how the virus is spreading. \"I think that we will be seeing blood transfusion screening for COVID increasingly ... to try to figure out what's going on in the community,\" Saxinger said.

We continue to receive a lot of questions about physical distancing in small spaces. Dennis D. wants to know whether his 93-year-old father can take the elevator with other people who are not wearing masks. Some experts suggest avoiding elevators when others are using them, but if you can't wait for the next one, here are some tips:  Spread out. Stand in opposite corners. Face away from others, because if someone sneezes or coughs, you can prevent potentially infected droplets from landing on your face and the mucosal membranes where the virus can get in.   \"In your everyday scenario — people coughing or sneezing — [the virus] doesn't actually get suspended in the air,\" says Dr. Samir Gupta, respirologist and associate professor at the University of Toronto. \"It simply travels in these droplets,\ " he explained, \"and these droplets will hit a surface or they'll land on the ground, but they won't stay suspended in the air.\ " That said, you should assume that the floors, the walls and the buttons are contaminated, so don't touch your face and wash your hands.

Carolyn B. sent a video question from Halifax about whether her condo building can enforce visitation rules on residents. Toronto-area lawyer Joe Nzemeke says it's possible tenants who do not follow public health directives could get evicted because tenants and visitors \"are obligated to protect others from danger, illegal acts and threats to health and safety.\" However, many provinces have suspended evictions during the pandemic. Patrick Cassidy, a partner at Сox & Palmer, a law firm that advises many condo corporations in Nova Scotia, says it's unlikely anyone could be evicted for not practising physical distancing, because \"you can't put your building on lockdown.\" Carolyn B. in Halifax asks CBC News if her condo building is legally allowed to restrict visitors from coming into her home. 0:26 Cassidy advises condos to put up signs reminding everyone that physical distancing applies to common areas such as elevators and lobbies, and to close public amenities such as gyms and pools. \"A condo building is like a small town, and its government is the board of directors, and they are doing the best that they can,\" he said.   Carolyn B. also says it's been tough living alone during the pandemic. Toronto-area therapist Allan Findlay of New Insights Counselling says it can definitely be more stressful and lonely for people who live alone.   CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis \"Staying apart from those we care about goes against our human social instincts. We all need to feel connected and especially now when we are experiencing so much loss of control and change in routines,\ " Findlay said.   \"Throughout difficult times in history, family members and friends have had to be separated from one another. However, this is a new experience for our generation. During times such as these, a willingness to sacrifice and a belief in a greater good can allow us to endure the distress of social isolation.\" Findlay says there are many creative ways to connect and communicate with friends and family electronically, adding it's important to go outside, keep a routine, sleep well and do something everyday that's enjoyable.

  As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread outside of China with hundreds of confirmed cases on a daily basis, experts say the situation is rapidly moving toward what's known as a pandemic. But World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday he is not yet ready to categorize the increased number of COVID-19 cases as a pandemic. \"For the moment, we're not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale severe diseases or deaths,\ " he said during a media briefing.   \"Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.\ "  Make sure your prescriptions are up to date, says this Canadian infectious disease expert. 1:21 He said the decision was based on an ongoing assessment of the spread of the virus worldwide, the severity of the disease it causes and the impact it has on society. As of Monday, the WHO said China had reported 77,362 cases of COVID-19, including 2,618 deaths. There were another 2,074 cases in 28 other countries, including 10 in Canada, and 23 deaths.   What is a pandemic?   A pandemic is the consistent spread of a new disease around the world in a population that has not yet gained immunity to it, according to the WHO. \"At the most basic sense, a pandemic just reflects the global transmission of an infectious disease,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital who is researching the outbreak.   \"If we're not using the term pandemic today, we may very well be using this term in the days ahead as we watch this unfold.\" A pack of meat is pictured on empty shelves at a supermarket in Pioltello, Italy, on Monday. Fears about the coronavirus have people stocking up on supplies.   (Flavio Lo Scalzo/Reuters) Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iran and several neighbouring Middle Eastern countries all have confirmed cases.   \"We're at the point where I wouldn't be surprised if the WHO called this a pandemic this week or next week,\" said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based international research organization, and an expert who has studied infectious diseases in China for more than 15 years.    \"I think we're more or less at that point now.\"   Why didn't the WHO call COVID-19 a pandemic? One reason why the WHO may have been hesitant to use the term pandemic to classify the outbreak is because it could incite fear among the global population.   \"I have spoken frequently about the need for facts, not fear,\" Tedros said. \"Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear.\" WATCH: WHO director general explains why the coronavirus outbreak isn't considered a pandemic. The World Health Organization says the coronavirus is a public health emergency of international concern but not a pandemic — at least for now. 1:16 While that may be the case, some experts say the need to communicate the situation clearly to countries around the world to ensure they prepare for more widespread transmission is essential.   Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba, says officials are likely still trying to determine whether the increase we're seeing is the result of relatively isolated cases where an individual spreads the virus to a small group, or evidence of \"sustained human-to-human transmission.\ " Whatever the answer, the situation could change quickly. All it might take is another spike in new cases outside of China for the WHO to apply the pandemic label, Kindrachuk said.   Canada prepares pandemic response plan as coronavirus cases continue to climb \"The unfortunate side is, if they wait too long to announce it, then you do deal with a potential for decreased public trust,\ " he said.   \"If you sound it too quickly and too urgently, then maybe it is like crying wolf, where people don't take it seriously enough.\ "  What changes in a pandemic? While a pandemic may not change much in terms of our ability to contain the spread of the virus, it does signal a shift in the way health officials are responding to it worldwide.   \"It changes our perspective from one of containment, to really looking at mitigating the impact of this epidemic,\ " Bogoch said. \"And that means different things to different parts of the world.\" For Canada , that would mean preparing our health-care system for an increase in both imported cases and locally acquired cases, in addition to increasing our ability to conduct testing in order to identify and treat patients, he said.   Europe, Middle East scramble to limit spread of coronavirusVideoB.C.'s 7th COVID-19 case connected to woman who flew from Iran \"If there is a silver lining, it's that when this starts to have greater global transmission, we will be nearing the tail end of our influenza season in Canada,\" he said.   \"And we will likely have greater capacity to deal with this because influenza season is certainly winding down.\" Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Monday Canada's pandemic response plan includes researching a vaccine, expanding testing capabilities and managing essential supplies.  But she also pointed out that Canada's course of action would be much the same whether the WHO declares a pandemic or not.

(Justin Tang/The Canadian press) \"I think what it does is it changes the public's mind with what we're dealing with now,\ " said Daszak, with EcoHealth Alliance.   \"I think it's incumbent on health authorities around the world to start telling their public what to expect and how to get ready mentally for what's going to happen.\ " Labelling the outbreak a pandemic may also lead countries to roll out specific pandemic response plans, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.   CBC InvestigatesWhy some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claimsStock markets sell off as coronavirus spread threatens global economy \"As the outbreak expands in its geographic scope, then travel becomes more of an issue in driving the further dispersion of the disease,\ " Khan said.   \"If this evolves into a full blown pandemic, this will really be ubiquitous — this will be found everywhere.\"  
  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  Coronavirus has spread to every continent except Antarctica, and U.S. health officials have warned that it's likely to turn into a global pandemic.   Globally, the majority of about 81,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, have been reported in China, where the outbreak began. But it has spread to at least 37 other countries, including Canada, according to the World Health Organization.   There have been clusters of new cases appearing in Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan over the past week, and officials fear the virus could spread undetected in other countries that lack the capacity to monitor people for signs of infection. The outbreak has taken about 3,000 lives, mostly in China, and its spread has rattled global financial markets. At least 13 cases have been reported in Canada. WATCH | Why a man who recovered still tested positive for coronavirus: A Japanese patient tested positive for coronavirus a second time, but an infectious disease expert cautions that the virus can be detected long after a patient has recovered. 1:30 \"As the coronavirus changes and travels across the globe, it's getting more and more difficult to isolate countries that are more specifically affected,\ " Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday, encouraging Canadians to stockpile food and medication in their homes in case they have to be quarantined. These graphics aim to put the outbreak into perspective and are current as of Feb. 26, 2020.    The vast majority of coronavirus cases initially occurred near Wuhan, China, and surrounding cities. But the outbreak has spread rapidly.   The WHO said Wednesday the number of new cases of the novel coronavirus reported outside China has exceeded the number of new cases developing in China.   The virus was first reported to World Health Organization officials in China on Dec. 31, 2019.   Most people who have caught COVID-19 have experienced symptoms similar to the flu and don't require emergency medical attention. Doctors and World Health Organization officials are racing to develop a vaccine or antiviral medicine to prevent or treat the virus, but to date nothing exists.   CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreak Ebola and influenza are not in the same family of infections as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) or the 2019 coronavirus  (2019-nCoV) — a temporary name for the new virus that was first detected in 2019.  The other viruses are used here to put the severity of coronaviruses into perspective through comparison.   Lab-confirmed flu and pneumonia-related deaths in 2018 in Canada alone are higher than those of all three coronaviruses combined.   The lab-confirmed flu and pneumonia totals (shown above in grey) are not definitive. Many Canadians who become infected during any given year do not seek medical help and therefore never get tested.   VideoCoronavirus outbreak: Advice and misconceptions Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that includes SARS, which affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases in 2003.   While the 2019 and SARS coronavirus seem to be closely related genetically, less is known about how transmissible and deadly the former is.   \"In essence , it's a version of SARS that spreads more easily, but causes less damage. The virus also uses the same receptor, the door used to get into human cells, which explains transmission and why it causes pneumonia,\" Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, wrote in an online comment. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses To estimate how bad an outbreak could get, experts look at the case fatality rate — the proportion of deaths a disease causes within a group of people. The problem with estimating the case fatality rate early in an outbreak is that the sickest people tend to go to the hospital or a doctor's office. Those who don't show or have mild symptoms may never seek medical care and won't be counted as cases.

  Researchers at two Quebec universities are working together in hopes of developing a new vaccine that could prevent COVID-19 and similar outbreaks.   On Friday, the federal government announced it would be providing $27 million in grants to 47 Canadian research teams, in order for them to do more research into COVID-19. $2.1 million of that is dedicated to an infectious disease research team at Laval University.   Denis Leclerc, a researcher at the university, said the infectious disease lab has been doing research on similar types of viral infections for the past 15 years.   The team is hoping to develop a broad spectrum vaccine that would not only prevent the spread of COVID-19, but would also target similar viruses in case of future outbreaks.   \"We would be able to stockpile it and keep it on reserve for long periods of time,\" said Leclerc.   Leclerc said they are basing much of their research off the 2002 SARS outbreak, as COVID-19 is similar to it in many ways.   \"The vaccine that we want to propose would basically protect people against both strains,\" said Leclerc.   \"We're targeting the proteins of the virus that are retained across all of its strains.\ "  Leclerc said his team could have a fully realized concept for a vaccine ready within the next six months, but getting the vaccine to a place where it could be used by the public would take a lot more time — and more money.   \"I have the money to prove our concept, but I don't have the money for clinical trials,\" said Leclerc.    Leclerc will be working with Amine Kamen, a biomedical engineer at McGill University, for the next steps.   Kamen's primary role in the research will be to generate antigens — toxins that urge the body to create antibodies in order to fight off disease.   Amine Kamen's primary role in the research will be to generate antigens — toxins that urge the body to create antibodies in order to fight off disease.   (Radio-Canada) By the time the vaccine goes through testing and clinical trials, it can take more than a year to reach the public, said Kamen.   \"Prior to any vaccine that gets approved there is a long sequence  of evaluations, of testing,\" said Kamen.   \"This will definitely take time for a vaccine that would be considered as a commercial vaccine. Experimental vaccines will come reasonably within the year.\ "  Because the vaccine could take so long, Kamen said researchers are focusing on developing a vaccine that could easily evolve in case the disease itself mutates.   The two universities are among 47 research teams across the country who were given the federal grant. Teams at the University of Toronto and Dalhousie University are also working on COVID-19 research.

How sick Canadian travellers are masking COVID-19 symptoms to get through airport screening Canadians desperate to return home from abroad in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are easily circumventing air travel screening aimed at preventing sick and infected passengers from boarding planes, CBC News has found.   Some people are simply hiding symptoms from officials to ensure they can get back home.  In a number of instances, sick travellers have boarded airplanes back to Canada, no matter the risks of spreading infection. \"Now is just the worst time to be coughing, sneezing or reporting any kind of symptom at an airport,\" said one university student in Toronto, who flew home from Spain on March 14. She admitted she purposely hid her symptoms and the fact she'd been suffering a fever hours before boarding the flight. \"It wasn't information you volunteered. So I just stayed quiet about it.\ "  CBC is withholding her name to shield her from backlash, given that she travelled two days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced anyone with symptoms would be barred from boarding return flights. In addition, she was only officially diagnosed with COVID-19 after she got home.   Her case demonstrates just how weak Canada's screening of air travellers is, given it relies solely on voluntary reporting of symptoms.  Even the \"enhanced screening\" adopted in recent days amounts to a simple series of health questions put to air travellers and does not involve any physical detection, testing or thermal screening now being used in many other countries.   Both Air Canada and WestJet said they have barred some passengers from boarding flights, but the situation has air crews and their unions calling for more safeguards to prevent sick travellers from boarding aircraft.  Read more on this story here.

Doctors from around the world are facing similar issues: lots of patients, long hours and frustration.  And there's concern that it could lead to some serious mental health concerns, even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study of front-line workers involved in the COVID-19 outbreak in China found that those involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with the disease had a higher risk of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress. Dr. Laura Hawryluck, the critical-care response team lead at Toronto Western Hospital, was on the front line during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. She said she saw the toll it took not only on patients in quarantine, but also on those in the medical field. Some, she said, chose to leave the field altogether.  Read more about the pressures health-care workers are facing.   Now for some good news to start your Wednesday:  After blood donations dropped by 40 per cent across the country amid coronavirus fears and warnings to stay home, political and health leaders issued an urgent appeal for people who can donate blood to continue.

Cydney Kane, a university student in Halifax, saw the plea on her social media feed. \"Just seeing the call go out and knowing that the need is going on and knowing that I could do something to help was more than enough to get me out and book an appointment,\ " she said shortly after giving blood at a Halifax clinic. Thanks to people like Kane, donations have bounced back across the country, and the hope is donors will keep returning.  Read more on this story here. Front Burner: Trump pushes the economy while experts warn of COVID-19 deaths On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he \"would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,\" which is two and a half weeks from now. But many public health experts say the result could be an increase in COVID-19 deaths. Today on Front Burner, CBC senior correspondent Susan Ormiston on the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. — Trump's hopes to see the economy reopened in mere weeks, and what it could mean for a country the World Health Organization warned could become the new epicentre of COVID-19.

U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt told the British government the boundary must be set his way or troops would be sent to enforce it.

As a result, Ottawa decided it must handle its own foreign relations and created the External Affairs Department in 1909.   1958:  The first test flight of the Canadian Avro Arrow fighter plane is carried out.

  The world we'll live in — post-pandemic. What will change when the COVID-19 pandemic ends? Will our world return to its old ways, or emerge retooled, revised, or perhaps even changed for the better? In this second instalment of a series looking at life after the coronavirus pandemic, CBC Manitoba looks at the historic treatment of vaccines, vaccine research and the science behind it — and whether lessons learned from COVID-19 will be heeded into the future.   A team of researchers has been given the green light — and money — to help science our way out of another pandemic. That's the good news. But history has revealed that the world has a short memory, and once the worst of the bad is over, interest in a preventative vaccine tends to die down, scientists say. That's the bad news.   Only time will tell whether lessons learned from this COVID-19 pandemic will sink in a little longer, but at least one researcher isn't optimistic. \"Maybe in the short term? I'm not sure about the long term,\" said research scientist Darryl Falzarano, laughing as he answered.   \"Sorry. I guess you caught me on a pessimistic day.\" 'There'll still be anti-vaxxers' Falzarano knows his coronaviruses. It's his job.   The former Manitoban (a graduate from both the University of Winnipeg and University of Manitoba) is now with the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, or VIDO-InterVac, at the University of Saskatchewan.   For years, he and his colleagues have done animal research on the potential for vaccines against coronaviruses that came along prior to COVID-19, like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For years, they've envisioned completing the next phase of this — a vaccine-manufacturing facility to support further vaccine research and, eventually, clinical trials on humans. Then came COVID-19. And now comes the money for VIDO-InterVac. How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine In March, the federal government committed $23 million to the academic research lab. Some of it — $11 million — was money already in the works prior to the outbreak, Falzarano says. The other $12 million is in direct response to the pandemic, and will go toward completing the vaccine-manufacturing facility, he says. And that, in return, will get them one step closer to beginning small, first-phase clinical vaccine trials on humans. \"It's been a work in progress for years,\ " Falzarano said. \"This will allow us to move things quicker.\" 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds upScience summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe Still, Falzarano knows there are some who'd just as soon they take their time. \"I'm sure there'll still be anti-vaxxers,\" he said, laughing again. He's right. Already, some in the anti-vaccination movement are pushing back against COVID-19. Some even allege the illness is a viral version of smoke and mirrors, created in a lab by those who want to score more money by creating a vaccine that pharmaceutical companies will pay for, but that no one really needs. Health policy professor Bruce Y. Lee says history has long predicted the world is not prepared for pandemics like COVID-19. ' None of what's happening is a surprise,' he says. (Submitted by Bruce Y. Lee) \"A lot of anti-vaxx efforts have an agenda behind them,\" said Bruce Y. Lee, a Forbes Magazine health reporter and professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. \"And those agendas don't stop during a pandemic.\ " This is despite the fact that COVID-19 should be the pandemic eye-opener that's long been predicted, Lee says.    If the world heals itself without COVID vaccination, then vaccine skepticism will likely increase.- Gregory Mason In a 2017 article he wrote for Forbes, Yee noted that Microsoft founder Bill Gates, citing leading scientists, cautioned of a pending pandemic that the world was not prepared for.   In 2009, Lee himself, with other leading scientists, had come to a similar conclusion while researching global responses to the H1N1 pandemic.   \"None of what's happening [with COVID-19] is a surprise,\" said Lee. \"And the fact that there's still pushback is not surprising either.\ " Which is why, Lee says, while he's happy to hear about Canada's new financial commitment to Falzarano and his colleagues, he's guarded in his enthusiasm. \"I think we need to be cautious about this. We've seen this repeat situation in an emergency, but then funding dried up.\" Lessons from the past University of Manitoba health economist Gregory Mason doesn't like the odds.   Mason uses risk analysis to understand the motivations of people who are anti-vaccination (or the \"vaccine hesitancy\" movement, \"as I politely call them,\" he says). The basic concept of risk analysis is simple — assess the probable impact of an action taken (or not), and act accordingly the next time around. \"Part of me wants to believe that COVID-19 is scaring the pants off everyone,\" he said. \"But [even] some family members are anti-vaxxers and I see their attitude to the present virus. I am less hopeful.\" 'If we see no repeat cycle ... this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly' after the coronavirus pandemic, says the University of Manitoba's Gregory Mason. (Warren Kay/CBC) History could be a lesson to us.  And it's tried, Mason says — but those lessons have been lost on us. Think back to SARS. In 2003, scientists came close to developing a SARS vaccine to test on humans.   It never made it to trial. As memories of the virus faded, so did public pressure, Mason says, \"because that pandemic just seemed to die out.\" Or think ebola. In 1999, scientists at Canada's then-new National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg began probing the deadly virus, and soon they realized they could develop a vaccine. But it took close to two decades before interest — and funds — led to a vaccine.   And that only happened after a 2014 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.   We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event.'- Bruce Y. Lee And even when a vaccine is created, there's backlash. If a virus is out of sight, it's out of mind.   Take the 2017 measles outbreak. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported a 31 per cent rise in worldwide measles cases that year, estimating 110,000 deaths due to the disease. The reason? A decrease in voluntary vaccinations. The reason for the decrease? The perception that no one gets the measles anymore. ' Immunity can wear off over time': Doctors highlight undervaccination in adultsMarketplaceNearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why. That's why, Mason says, he's doubtful about lessons learned from COVID-19. It might be a better teacher, but its students might soon forget the lesson; especially if the anticipated \"second wave\" of the virus wanes, he says. \"If we see no repeat cycle in the late fall, this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly,\ " Mason said. \"In fact, if the world heals itself without COVID vaccination, then vaccine skepticism will likely increase.\ " What's more, others say, history may not be done with us. \"We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event,'\" Lee says. \"The question is not 'if' but 'when' another pandemic occurs.\" And he poses an even more worrying question. \"Is this pandemic a warning for an even bigger one?\" However, VIDO-InterVac's Falzarano, and his colleagues across the country, are determined to be part of the global effort to prevent that. \"I would hope that [this pandemic] leads people to see that vaccinations are important,\ " he said. \"If we'd had a vaccine ready to go … you could see how impactful that would be.\"  Read more from this series: Post-pandemic, advocates hope to see 'new appreciation,' support for gig workers

Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is investing more than $23 million US in the development of new vaccines against COVID-19. France's president has announced a video summit of G7 leaders on Monday to discuss co-ordinating research on vaccines and treatments as well as an economic response to the pandemic. A vaccine would prevent the pandemic from spreading as fast as it is now, said Charu Kaushic, scientific director of Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Infection and Immunity. \"It's just spreading everywhere,\ " she said. \"If we had a vaccine , we could control it.\ " Kaushic said instead of putting all its eggs in one basket, CIHR is funding multiple projects in the hopes that at least one of them will work. 2 elements to a successful vaccine  To work, a vaccine needs to succeed in getting our immune system to produce antibodies in the blood. The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it. Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs. \"Vaccines can fail because you can get very good antibodies and other things that work great in the blood, but not in the lungs. \"You may not get protective immunity at all.\" An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute in  northern Israel this month, where efforts are underway to produce a vaccine against COVID-19.   (Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty) Viruses, especially new ones, are particularly difficult because they aren't well understood. For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted. Even though multiple researchers are working on the problem, it is rare to get a new vaccine in under a year. A top U.S. health official told a House committee that human trials for a potential vaccine could begin within a few weeks with the goal of going into the arms of the general public within 12 to 18 months. Vaccine in a year?   The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \"I want to make sure people understand, and I've said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\ " NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"We mean it's record time to get it tested. It's going to take a year to a year-and-a-half to really know if it works.\" Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material from the virus in the form of nucleic acid. That tells the human body how to make proteins that mimic viral proteins and this should provoke an immune response. Currently the pandemic coronavirus has infected more than 130,000 people worldwide.  While most people have mild respiratory symptoms, a vaccine would be a safer way to protect people because it would reduce the risk of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Denis Leclerc, an infectious diseases researcher at Laval University in Quebec City, said the advantage of nucleic acid vaccines like Moderna's is that they're much faster to produce than other types. Denis Leclerc and his colleagues at Laval University are hoping to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled in case of future outbreaks.   (Radio-Canada) While relatively safe, nucleic acid vaccines are generally not the preferred strategy, Leclerc said, because they don't have the same safety record as the traditional approach. Leclerc's team has a different approach. They are working with a small part of a protein from the virus that can be synthesized quickly and then attached to a platform to trigger an efficient immune response in humans. \"I was thinking of still using proteins to conserve very high safety and still get speed,\ " Leclerc said. His team has animal data showing this approach might work for coronavirus and for other viruses that emerge in future. Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study revealsAs coronavirus spread speeds up, Montreal researchers will trial an anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 in China Leclerc expects the proof-of-concept experiments for his COVID-19 vaccine will be ready in six months. Even though it's fast to develop, it may come too late for the current pandemic of COVID-19. That's what happened with Canada's Ebola vaccine. The experiments happened years previously, but the vaccine wasn't manufactured in time for the 2014 epidemic that ravaged West Africa. The Ebola vaccine is being used now to control Congo's outbreak. These Quebec professors are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccineFrom test strips to llama antibodies, U of O researchers take on COVID-19 Elsewhere in Quebec City, the biotech firm Medicago is producing another potential COVID-19 vaccine that uses particles that mimic the virus. Researchers will mass produce that vaccine candidate quickly in plants instead of the slower traditional way of using animal cells or eggs. The company is using the same approach to produce seasonal flu vaccines, in an effort under review by Health Canada. 
  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"
  Ottawa is giving $23 million to VIDO-InterVac in Saskatoon. The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre is based at the University of Saskatchewan. Half of the money is earmarked to build a pilot-scale manufacturing plant on campus to accelerate vaccine development. \"The $12 million enables us to build the facility to good manufacturing practices standards as required for human vaccine production,\" said VIDO-InterVac director Volker Gerdts. \"We expect to begin vaccine production in a little more than a year.\"   Go inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine    There is currently no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. VIDO-InterVac is the first lab in the country to have a vaccine candidate in animal testing. The vaccine was made in February, and researchers expect to know in about four weeks whether the vaccine works in an animal model. Clinical testing of this vaccine in humans could start as early as this fall. The balance of the money will go to operational funding for high-containment laboratories. 
  A Dalhousie University researcher at the forefront of Canada's quest to find a treatment for COVID-19 says human trials for a new vaccine could be only weeks away. Dalhousie's COVID-19 rapid response team is moving forward with testing a vaccine that uses a genome of DNA from SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"We're beginning to evaluate this in animal models and we can even bring this into people for Phase 1 clinical trials as soon as three weeks from now,\ " virologist Alyson Kelvin told CBC's Information Morning on Wednesday. \"Right now, DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in people, so we hope that this will help expedite the process of vaccine development.\" How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine But Kelvin, an assistant professor in Dalhousie's department of microbiology and immunology, also cautioned that it typically takes a year for vaccines to be developed, tested and distributed to the general public. Alyson Kelvin is working with three vaccines developed by a Halifax molecular virologist and a vaccine developed by a scientist at the centre. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press) \"We're working as hard as we can to move this as fast as possible,\ " she said. \"We have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this isn't the best vaccine that we can put forth.\ " There are now 68 cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, which has been under a state of emergency since Sunday. Halifax father-daughter duo researching 'rapid response' tests, vaccines to combat COVID-19 Unlike a typical flu vaccine that's created using protein from a virus, Kelvin said the vaccine her team is testing uses a piece of the virus's DNA. \"And it uses your own cells to produce protein that will teach your immune system what the virus looks like,\ " she said.   Kelvin said the DNA vaccine was developed by her colleague, Roy Duncan, and is one of three types of vaccines the team is evaluating right now.   How long will it take? Kelvin said SARS CoV-2 is a good candidate for a vaccine because coronaviruses don't mutate as quickly as the influenza virus does.   The virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its DNA when it replicates and infects a host, she said.   \"Which means that the virus and its proteins are a bit more stable so we can target it better.\" VIDO-InterVac, the Saskatoon-based lab where Kelvin is working as a visiting professor, began researching a vaccine in January, and just received $23 million from the federal government to keep doing that work.   But even with an influx of funding, and with scientists around the world working feverishly, vaccine development can be a long and complicated process. Kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time COVID-19 returns. \"There's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus. If this is the case, we'll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back,\ " Kelvin said.   In the meantime, stay home As researchers spend long days in the lab, Nova Scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning, Kelvin said. Stay home, and if you must go out, stay away from other people.   \"Social distancing is now the best weapon for fighting this virus,\ " she said.   Dal researchers sending medical supplies to heart of coronavirus outbreak Kelvin will be part of an online panel about COVID-19 on Wednesday night hosted by the MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance at Dalhousie University.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke about the struggles of Canadians abroad and the need to step up testing for COVID-19 on Thursday, a day after announcing an $82-billion COVID-19 response package that includes measures ranging from wage subsidies and income supports to a temporary boost to the child benefit program. Canada has more than 800 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, an illness caused by the novel coronavirus that first emerged in China. The number of cases has been increasing daily, sparking concern about the capacity of Canada's health-care systems and prompting provinces to cancel classes, call for the closure of some businesses and introduce rules to promote social distancing. The federal government is suspending passport services except in the cases of urgent travel; such as serious illness, the death of a friend or family member, humanitarian work or in the event the person would otherwise lose a job or business.  Service Canada says anyone who does not meet the criteria for urgent travel — or is experiencing symptoms such as a fever, coughing, having trouble breathing — will have to wait. Ontario on Thursday announced its second death from COVID-19, Alberta reported its first, while B.C. reported one additional death, bringing its total to eight.    Canada's top doctor told reporters Thursday that officials are concerned about the increase of cases in Ontario, particularly three cases being investigated as coming from community transmission.

Prepare to see COVID-19 cases rising. That doesn't mean social distancing has failed COVID-19 isn't just testing governments, it's testing citizens   For most of those people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. The vast majority of people recover from the virus, but some people who are infected — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — are at higher risk of facing a more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. As the worldwide death toll crept toward 10,000 and the number of infections topped 220,000 (including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered), officials around the world urged people to come together, while staying physically apart. \"When you love someone, you should avoid taking them in your arms,\ " French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said in parliament. \"It's counterintuitive  and it's painful; the psychological consequences, the way we are living, are very disturbing — but it's what we must do.\"   Here's what's happening in the provinces and territories British Columbia on Wednesday declared a state of emergency, a move that allows the province to do things like secure supply chains.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19 amid the fast-spreading outbreak. Trump, speaking at a news conference, pointed to efforts around an experimental antiviral drug, Remdesivir, and the generic anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, saying he had called on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to streamline its regulatory approval process. \"We have to remove every barrier,\ " Trump said. Trials on potential coronavirus therapies are already in the works, and it was unclear how Trump's call for faster experimental testing process could further expedite an effective treatment for the virus, which as yet has no proven vaccine or cure.

Yet he seemed to minimize the urgency of the decision, later tweeting that he \"only signed the Defence Production Act to combat the [virus] should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.\ " \"Hopefully there will be no need,\ " he added, \"but we are all in this TOGETHER!\ " The U.S. Centers for Disease Control as of Wednesday was reporting 7,038 cases and 97 deaths, but those figures are updated once daily and lag some other tallies — including a Johns Hopkins University tracker that puts the U.S. figure at 9,415 cases, with more than 150 dead and more than 100 recovered.

The U.S. military said Thursday it is pausing the movement of any new troops into Afghanistan and is quarantining 1,500 troops and civilians who recently arrived in order to protect them from the new coronavirus. Troops who are already in the country may have their deployments extended so missions can continue. Here's what's happening in Europe From Reuters and The Associated Press, updated at 2:30 p.m. ET. Italy's death toll surpassed China's on Thursday, in a stark illustration of how the outbreak has pivoted toward Europe and the United States. With a population of 60 million, Italy has recorded at least 3,405 deaths as of Thursday, or roughly 150 more than in China — a country with a population over 20 times larger. Also on Thursday, a northern Italian town whose cemetery has been overwhelmed began loading bodies into trucks to move them to neighbouring provinces. Italy reached its bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, recorded no new infections  —  a sign that the communist country's draconian lockdowns were a powerful method to stop the virus' spread.   A woman wearing a protective mask walks past a banner thanking health-care workers hanging at one of the entrances of the Timone hospital and the IHU Mediterranee Infection Institute in Marseille, southeastern France. (Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images) The United Nations and Italian health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy's high toll, key among them its large elderly population, who are particularly susceptible to developing serious complications from the virus. Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan's and the vast majority of Italy's dead — 87 per cent — were over age 70. In addition, virtually all of Italy's dead had one or more underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension or renal insufficiency.   Italy still has far fewer confirmed cases than China — 41,035 as of Thursday, compared to more than 80,900 in China. Schools in Italy are likely to remain closed beyond April 3, Italy's education minister said on Thursday. \"As Prime Minister [Giuseppe ] Conte said, I think we are going toward an extension of the April 3 deadline,\" Lucia Azzolina told SkyTG24. Schools and universities were closed on March 5. As of late Wednesday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported almost 71,000 cases, with 3,309 deaths.   The palace of Monaco says its ruler, Prince Albert II, has tested positive for COVID-19 but that his health is not worrying. Albert, 62, appeared to be the first head of state who has publicly said he contracted the virus. In a statement Thursday, the palace said he is being treated by doctors from the Princess Grace Hospital, named after his American actress mother. France's Cannes Film Festival has been postponed, following weeks of speculation over whether it would go ahead. Meanwhile, the Costa Luminosa transatlantic cruise ship, which has recorded several cases of COVID-19 among its passengers, has docked in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille on Thursday morning. More than 1,400 people, including more than 75 Canadians, are on the cruise. French authorities have allowed the ship to dock and stay up to four days under strict conditions. It is not known whether passengers will be allowed off, given the current stringent restrictions in France amid the coronavirus pandemic.   In Sweden, more than 1,000 laid-off SAS airline workers are being offered fast-track health-care training to help fight the coronavirus. Sophiahemmet University will run a three-day pilot for 30 people at the end of March with the hope of eventually extending the course to hundreds more. Europe is scrambling to slow the spread of the virus, with countries introducing a range of measures including tighter border controls, school and business closures and plans designed to boost ailing economies. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he's confident the U.K. \"can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks,\" and that Britain is in talks to buy a coronavirus antibody test \"as simple as a pregnancy test.\ " The British government previously announced it plans to introduce a bill in Parliament later Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. The bill gives police and immigration officers powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health. The Bank of England also slashed its key interest rate to 0.1 per cent  —  its lowest-ever level  — amid global economic turmoil sparked by the pandemic. The bank's monetary policy committee says the unanimous decision is part of moves \"to meet the needs of U.K. businesses and households in dealing with the associated economic disruption.\" Thursday's rate cut came a week after the central bank cut its rate from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent.   At least 137 people have died from 2,689 confirmed cases of the virus so far in the U.K.   WATCH | People around the world applaud health-care workers: Applause breaks out in places across the globe in appreciation of health-care workers fighting against the coronavirus. 0:45 Here's what's happening in Asia From Reuters, The Associated Press and CBC News, updated at 8 p.m. ET.

  As public health officials across the globe try to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, researchers at the University of Alberta are trying to get it into their lab and under their microscopes.   Researchers at the university's Li Ka Shing institute of virology have already ordered the virus' genetic material as they look to discover potential antivirals and vaccines. Director Dr. Lorne Tyrrell says the institute is also in the process of clearing the tight regulatory hurdles to acquire the entire virus.   \"We built the facilities so that we can handle the virus,\" Tyrrell said. \"We have a number of labs that are very keen to work on this virus, either on parts of the virus or the whole virus.\"  On Monday, the federal government launched a new slate of expedited funding opportunities for coronavirus researchers.   The Canadian Institutes of Health Research is offering two-year, $1-million grants to researchers working on counter measures to the virus, whether it's a way to help diagnose it or vaccines to prevent it. The deadline for applications close in a week, an indication of just how quickly researchers are mobilizing their efforts.    No immediate plan to change Canada's travel, isolation rules as global number of coronavirus cases climbs Morneau warns that coronavirus will have a 'real' impact on Canadian economy   Tyrrell says he is confident the institute will have the entire virus within two weeks and there's no reason for the general public to be concerned. \"If the general population is concerned, just think about the people that are working with these viruses all the time,\ " he said.  \"But they have learned to work with them, it's very safe and there should be no problem.\ " With the genetic material, researchers can build the virus' proteins in a lab. They can test what compounds could stop those proteins from activating and replicating the virus. And with that, they can start to develop potential antivirals and vaccines, which they would eventually test against the entire virus.   \"I just wanted people in Alberta to know that this institute is designed for this type of work. We have excellent virologists who are chomping at the bit to get this virus and begin their work.\" ' Around for quite a bit longer' The government launched the expedited research opportunities the same day health officials announced the coronavirus death toll had surpassed 1,000, eclipsing the number of people believed to have died in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.   \"I thought this virus was going to be controlled quicker by public health,\ " Tyrrell said.  \"I think they've done everything they possibly can, but I think this virus is showing signs that it might be around for quite a bit longer and more infectious.\" A quarantine site has been set up at the Canadian Forces base in Trenton, Ont., for hundreds of Canadians evacuated from China.   The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The total number of confirmed cases in China reached 40,325 by Monday morning, with another 319 cases confirmed in other countries.    'Safe in their care': Evacuees describe life under quarantine at CFB Trenton Coronavirus deaths in China pass 1,000, WHO warns epidemic must not spread out of control   In an ideal scenario, Tyrrell said researchers will find compounds already approved for use in other vaccines and antivirals that are effective against the coronavirus. It would take months and potentially years to get new medications approved for human use, Tyrrell said.   \"At the end of the day, this is about trying to find, through cooperation around the world, the best and fastest way we can to control this epidemic so that people are safe and can travel again without a problem.\"
  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation. 
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is a summary of some recent research from peer-reviewed academic journals and scientific agencies: A study in the journal Nature has looked at when a person with lab-confirmed COVID-19 is most infectious. In examining 77 pairs of people, one of whom had been infected by the other, it found that the sick person had the highest viral load right about the time their symptoms began to appear. The paper estimates that 44 per cent of the study cases resulted from contact with an infected person before symptoms began. It concludes that infectiousness peaks on or just before people begin to feel sick, and suggests public health measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission. The canine question Canadian research that suggested dogs could be a possible source of the novel coronavirus is getting a rough ride. The original paper, published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, said the novel coronavirus has far less of a certain type of genetic material than other viruses in the same family. It said dogs carry a virus that has a similar profile of that material, suggesting canines could be the original source of the virus causing COVID-19. Other scientists, however, have dismissed that as speculation. They point out that there is wide variation between viruses and that similarities between the novel coronavirus and the dog virus don't necessarily mean the two are linked. Immunity answers A paper in the journal Science says the future of social distancing and other non-drug ways to slow the spread of COVID-19 depends on how long immunity lasts for people who have been infected. The paper says immunity to reinfection probably fades over time and wintertime outbreaks are likely to occur for years to come. It says those outbreaks will be just as capable of overloading health-care capacity as the current pandemic. The authors conclude that without a vaccine or other pharmaceutical developments, social distancing and other controls may be needed off and on through 2022, with the disease itself reappearing as late as 2025. The mental toll The journal Psychology, Health and Medicine has examined the mental-health impacts of COVID-19 in 7,236 respondents from China. It found 35 per cent suffered anxiety, 20 per cent showed depressive symptoms and 18 per cent had poor sleep during the outbreak in that country. People under 35 years old were most affected. Health-care workers had the highest rate of poor sleep, and that rate increased the more time they spent at work. The journal recommends continuous monitoring of such workers during outbreaks. A controversial remedy One Chinese study that has not been peer-reviewed says it has found little benefit to the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that has been the centre of controversy. The study compared 75 adult COVID-19 patients who received standard treatment with 75 who received treatment along with hydroxychloroquine. It found no measurable differences in viral load between the two groups after 28 days — nor did it find differences at five points during that interval — suggesting hydroxychloroquine did not cure the infection. Some symptoms were alleviated, however, once researchers stopped giving other antiviral drugs to those taking hydroxychloroquine. The study found adverse side effects were three times higher for those who took hydroxychloroquine, the most common being diarrhea. The gender balance A paper to be published in the Journal of Infection has broken down how long different groups remained infectious with the novel coronavirus. Researchers found the median time between diagnosis and the last positive test for the virus was 26 days. There was no significant difference between men and women. Patients younger than 60 carried the virus for about 20 days and those who were older were infectious for 28 days. 
 Disruptions to immunization programs across South Asia because of the coronavirus pandemic are upending attempts to vaccinate millions of children against deadly diseases, the United Nations' children's fund UNICEF warned on Tuesday. The pandemic has interrupted vaccine supply chains and left families fearful of attending clinics, UNICEF said, creating another looming health crisis in a region where 4.5 million children were not fully immunized against diseases such as measles, diphtheria and polio. \"While the COVID-19 virus does not appear to make many children seriously ill, the health of hundreds of thousands of children could be impacted by this disruption of regular immunization services,\" said Jean Gough, director of UNICEF's South Asia office, in a statement. \"This is a very serious threat.\" More than 1.5 million people die globally of diseases that could be prevented by vaccinations, according to UNICEF. The UNICEF warning echoes a message Monday from the World Health Organization, which said the coronavirus pandemic is still disrupting normal health services, especially life-saving immunization for children in the poorest countries. WHO expressed concern about rising numbers of cases and deaths in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries, even as the numbers flatten or decline in some wealthier countries. A girl gets her finger marked after she is administered polio vaccine drops at a civil dispensary in Peshawar in July 2019. One health care worker in the Pakistani city predicted to Reuters that polio cases would increase because of the focus on the novel coronavirus. (Fayaz Aziz/Reuters) \"We have a long road ahead of us and a lot of work to do,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference in Geneva, adding that a second wave of infections could be prevented with the right actions. Tedros expressed concern that the health of children was being threatened by the impact of the coronavirus emergency on vaccination programs for other diseases. \"Children may be at relatively low risk from severe disease and death from COVID-19 — the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus — but can be at high risk from other diseases that can be prevented with vaccines,\" said Tedros. Some 13 million people have been affected worldwide by delays in regular immunizations against diseases including polio, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis, he said. Shortages of vaccines against other diseases are being reported in 21 countries as a result of border restrictions and disruptions to travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Tedros said, citing the GAVI global vaccine alliance. \"The number of malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa could double,\" he said, referring to the potential impact of COVID-19 on regular malaria services. \"That doesn't have to happen, we are working with countries to support them.\" Concerns about polio increase in Pakistan Pakistan, which along with Afghanistan is home to one of the world's last polio outbreaks, has suspended its vaccination campaign against the crippling disease. In one epicentre, the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, senior government officials and health workers told Reuters they were concerned about a possible rise in polio cases. \"We completely stopped our efforts since the COVID-19 pandemic in the country and missed two important campaigns so far,\" said one official with the polio eradication program in Peshawar, adding he expected it would be months before the campaign could resume. Putting off kids' vaccines during COVID-19 heightens risk of other outbreaksTrump's move to cut WHO funding prompts world condemnation Globally polio cases have been cut by more than 99 per cent since 1988, but it remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. More than 100 people were infected in Pakistan in 2019, a resurgence from a record low global annual figure of 22 cases in 2017. But since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 lung disease, workers have been reassigned. \"Since the polio campaign stopped … in February, we are tracing people arriving from overseas, those having symptoms similar to coronavirus and holding meetings with local residents and prayer leaders to ensure social distance in mosques,\" said one worker in Peshawar. \"I am doing a completely different job…. I fear the number of polio cases will definitely rise after the coronavirus outbreak is over.\" Pakistan's polio eradication program has long had to battle against rumours and social media campaigns claiming the vaccine is harmful to children, sending workers into communities to educate families on the benefits of immunization. 
  A Dalhousie University researcher at the forefront of Canada's quest to find a treatment for COVID-19 says human trials for a new vaccine could be only weeks away. Dalhousie's COVID-19 rapid response team is moving forward with testing a vaccine that uses a genome of DNA from SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"We're beginning to evaluate this in animal models and we can even bring this into people for Phase 1 clinical trials as soon as three weeks from now,\ " virologist Alyson Kelvin told CBC's Information Morning on Wednesday. \"Right now, DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in people, so we hope that this will help expedite the process of vaccine development.\" How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine But Kelvin, an assistant professor in Dalhousie's department of microbiology and immunology, also cautioned that it typically takes a year for vaccines to be developed, tested and distributed to the general public. Alyson Kelvin is working with three vaccines developed by a Halifax molecular virologist and a vaccine developed by a scientist at the centre. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press) \"We're working as hard as we can to move this as fast as possible,\ " she said. \"We have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this isn't the best vaccine that we can put forth.\ " There are now 68 cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, which has been under a state of emergency since Sunday. Halifax father-daughter duo researching 'rapid response' tests, vaccines to combat COVID-19 Unlike a typical flu vaccine that's created using protein from a virus, Kelvin said the vaccine her team is testing uses a piece of the virus's DNA. \"And it uses your own cells to produce protein that will teach your immune system what the virus looks like,\ " she said.   Kelvin said the DNA vaccine was developed by her colleague, Roy Duncan, and is one of three types of vaccines the team is evaluating right now.   How long will it take? Kelvin said SARS CoV-2 is a good candidate for a vaccine because coronaviruses don't mutate as quickly as the influenza virus does.   The virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its DNA when it replicates and infects a host, she said.   \"Which means that the virus and its proteins are a bit more stable so we can target it better.\" VIDO-InterVac, the Saskatoon-based lab where Kelvin is working as a visiting professor, began researching a vaccine in January, and just received $23 million from the federal government to keep doing that work.   But even with an influx of funding, and with scientists around the world working feverishly, vaccine development can be a long and complicated process. Kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time COVID-19 returns. \"There's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus. If this is the case, we'll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back,\ " Kelvin said.   In the meantime, stay home As researchers spend long days in the lab, Nova Scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning, Kelvin said. Stay home, and if you must go out, stay away from other people.   \"Social distancing is now the best weapon for fighting this virus,\ " she said.   Dal researchers sending medical supplies to heart of coronavirus outbreak Kelvin will be part of an online panel about COVID-19 on Wednesday night hosted by the MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance at Dalhousie University.

  Now that the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, shutting down cities and even an entire country, many people want to know more about what they can do to fight COVID-19.     Canada confirmed its first case on Jan. 25 and as the new virus makes its way around the world, here's a breakdown of what it is, who is most at risk, and most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself.   1. What is COVID-19?   It's the illness that's caused by a viral respiratory infection. The virus that leads to COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2​​​​. Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinical scientist with Sinai Health System in Toronto, said SARS-CoV-2 probably started showing up in China in November 2019. The World Health Organization says Chinese officials first reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause to the WHO Country Office on Dec. 31, 2019.     What we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreak    A woman crosses a main street in the centre of Beijing, virtually empty over the past three weeks due to the coronavirus crisis. (Saša Petricic/CBC) 2. Who is most at risk?   Overall, 80 per cent of those who get infected will have mild symptoms, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert at University Health Network in Toronto.   Severe COVID-19 cases are more common for those who are \"older, immunocompromised and/or have underlying health issues,\" said McGeer.   Visitors to Toronto’s Eaton Centre take advantage of complimentary hand sanitizer amid mounting concerns over the spread of COVID-19 on March 4, 2020. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) In February, China's centre for disease control and prevention (China CDC), published a study outlining the age and gender of 72,314 people infected with COVID-19.    The findings show that about 80 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 in China were 60 or older.    This virus does not infect you through your skin-Dr. Alison McGeer In Italy, the National Health Institute says the average age of patients who have died is 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems. \"The disease in children appears to be mild,\" said McGeer.   China CDC found that only 0.9 per cent of infections were children under the age of 10.    Canada's first COVID-19 death is not cause for panic — but shows need to protect most vulnerable   3. How can you protect yourself?   According to the World Health Organization:  Wash your hands frequently. Keep your hands away from your face. Maintain at least one-metre distance between you and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Stay home if you're unwell. Cough or sneeze into your sleeve.    Proper hand hygiene, said McGeer, can greatly reduce your risk of contracting the illness.    Registered nurse Barbara Brady is seen here wearing the garb that health-care professionals use when dealing with patients during outbreaks.

How does it spread?   The World Health Organization says the virus is spread from person-to-person through small droplets from an infected person's mouth or nose.   \"If you get the virus on your hands, this virus does not infect you through your skin,\" said McGeer.  \"It has to then be transmitted to your eyes, mouth or nose.\ "   Passengers leave Vancouver International Airport in masks during the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020.

Should you be stockpiling toilet paper? Food?   COVID-19 isn't a gastrointestinal virus, said McGeer.   \"We've seen quarantines in China and Italy … but there's not been a circumstance in which there has been shortages of food or or basic supplies or life saving medication.,\" she said.   Shoppers at Superstore buy paper towels and toilet paper in Vancouver on March 2, 2020.

What is next for the virus?   WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and some drug treatments are currently under investigation.   But Bogoch said a vaccine is at least a year away.   He said the infectious disease community believes that there are three scenarios for the future of COVID-19:    It will spread around the world and burn itself out. It will spread around the world and there will always be low-level transmission.   It will spread globally and eventually integrate itself into the colder seasonal viruses like the influenza virus.     \"We need to develop an effective vaccine to protect communities from this infection, because it's unlikely to go away anytime soon,\" said Bogoch. Ontario now has 60 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Here's what you need to knowMarch Break: What to think about before you travel amid the COVID-19 outbreak'Like a petri dish': Advocates worry Toronto's homeless shelters are ill-prepared for COVID-19
  As Canadian public health agencies prepare to deal with a new viral illness, a specialized lab in Saskatoon is using its research on different strains of the coronavirus to help develop a vaccine. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, also known as VIDO-InterVac, has received permission from the Public Health Agency of Canada to focus on the threat. \"People need to work together and collaborate and share the information,\" said its executive director, Volker Gerdts. The deadly coronavirus, first linked to a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has been connected to 26 deaths and infections in hundreds of people. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States have each reported at least one case of the virus. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada and officials say the risk of an outbreak remains low. CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? About five or six people in Canada are being monitored, including those with a travel history to the Wuhan area and with symptoms of the illness. Respiratory samples are being sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. \"Emerging diseases arrive and, because of all the travel we do and the connectiveness we have right now, the world becomes smaller and smaller and there's a better chance for these pathogens to quickly spread around the globe,\ " Gerdts said. ' We have expertise' The Saskatchewan lab was developed in the wake of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2003 to ensure that Canada could be prepared for emerging disease and illness, he said. Researchers there have spent a significant amount of time focusing on pathogens like coronaviruses. Gerdts said they've successfully developed a vaccine for coronavirus strains in cattle and pigs. \"We have expertise in working with them.\ " While coronaviruses are relatively small, they are known for mutating and jumping species, which is why they cause so many problems. Gerdts explained the coronavirus strain in pigs had not been seen in North America until two years ago. But within a year it had affected 10 million of the animals. ' Just incredible:' Mass quarantines take China into uncharted territory Colleagues in China have made the outbreak-specific coronavirus genome sequence available to researchers around the world, Gerdts said. His lab is now using it to hopefully find a way to help. The lab also has clearance to handle samples of the pathogen and is attempting to get samples from China or the U.S. If that's not possible, it will order synthetic gene fragments. The goal is to have the first vaccine candidates ready for testing in animals within six to eight weeks, Gerdts said. But human trials are at least a year away. Gerdts said Canada has taken a leading role in developing vaccines, including one for the Ebola virus, and there's a need to have more capacity to manufacture them here. If his lab had a manufacturing facility that he's been advocating for, he said production of a coronavirus vaccine for human testing could happen quicker. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Canadian research is part of a global effort and will be shared with the World Health Organization. \"We currently do not have a specific vaccine against this novel coronavirus,\ " she said. \"With a global effort on preparedness, I think that's something that we need to strive for.\"
  Alberta researchers are hopeful that an antiviral drug engineered to treat the deadly Ebola virus will prove a viable treatment in the ongoing fight against the coronavirus. The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies began enrolling patients in early March. Gilead Sciences — an American biotechnology company with a production facility in Edmonton — developed the drug in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed that several other treatments were more effective against Ebola and remdesivir was discontinued as a treatment. However, testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. ' A very potent compound' The first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States received remdesivir for compassionate use, which allows the use of an unapproved drug to treat a seriously-ill patient when no other treatments are available. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit and received the drug on the seventh day of illness. The next day the patient showed a marked improvement and his symptoms eventually disappeared altogether. If proven effective, remdesivir would be one of the few available remedies for a respiratory illness which has killed thousands of people around the world.   Anecdotal evidence and promising results in animals trials make the drug a strong candidate for clinical trials, said Matthias Götte, chair of the medical microbiology and immunology department at the University of Alberta. Götte has been working with his team to find out how the drug may be used to treat coronaviruses. An attack from the inside His study, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in late February, was among the first in Canada to examine the COVID-19 strain, and explore why remdesivir might be an effective treatment. \"We know the drug works against different coronaviruses, like MERS and SARS, and we know the novel coronavirus is very similar to SARS,\" Götte said. \"The pre-clinical data looked very good. It was a very potent compound so we were interested in the actual mechanism, how that drug actually works against Ebola. \"We created a synthetic version of this enzyme and, in a test tube, we were able to study the mechanism of remdesivir against this Ebola target.\ "   Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world Wednesday   Götte's research shows that the drug stops the virus from replicating. It disrupts the viruses biochemistry by masquerading as a part of the virus itself.    \"Remdesivir essentially mimics one of the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis necessary for genome replication of the virus,\ " Götte said. \"Enzymes within the virus are synthesizing the viral RNA genome with these building blocks, but they mix up the bits they need with the drug. Once the drug is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the virus can no longer replicate.\"   Last week, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will begin this month in countries across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers.   This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.- Matthias Gotte. Götte said no matter the results of the studies, his team will continue to examine how the drug interacts with the new virus. The results of the clinical trial will be only the first step in finding an effective treatment, and one drug will likely not be enough.    \"Ideally, we will have a couple of drugs because certain strains could be resistant to certain treatments,\ " Götte said. He will be anxiously awaiting the results of the ongoing clinical trials which could be available as early as May. \"One thing is clear. This is not a cure,\ " Götte said. \"We have to wait for the clinical trial results. That's the gold standard and we have to be patient.\ "     \"This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.\"  Overwhelming demand     Meanwhile, Gilead, overwhelmed by demand for the experimental treatment, abruptly shut down its emergency access program this week.   The company said it was setting up a broader access program that could try to help more sick people but its current program is unprepared to handle the current health crisis.    \"We recognize that there are severely ill patients who are unable to enrol in clinical trials and for whom no approved treatment options are effective,\ " reads a statement from the company. \"Gilead has been working with regulatory agencies to provide remdesivir to these patients where feasible.\"  Treating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon   To date, the company said it has provided emergency access to remdesivir for several hundred patients in the United States, Europe and Japan. Health Canada had also been considering special access requests for the drug on a patient-by-patient basis. \"In recent weeks, there has been an exponential increase in compassionate-use requests for emergency access to remdesivir, related to the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States,\" reads the statement from Gilead. \"This has flooded an emergency-treatment-access system that was set up for very limited access to investigational medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic.\"  'A fundamental shift': Nearly half of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada now from community spread
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV. 
  Thousands of people smiled, laughed, shook hands and conversed at one of the largest dental conferences in North America last month unaware of a deadly virus circling among them. More than 15,000 attendees, presenters or vendors were part of the Pacific Dental Conference at the Vancouver Convention Centre in early March. Six days later, public health officials sent out a warning: an attendee had tested positive for COVID-19. More positive tests followed. A dentist from British Columbia, Dr. Denis Vincent, died two weeks after the convention. In the days and weeks that followed, positive cases linked to the conference popped up across Canada: at least 32 in B.C., nine in Alberta and three in Saskatchewan. It's not known how many people were infected with the novel coronavirus at the convention because not all regions have provided that information.   Thousands of attendees at Vancouver dental conference told to self-isolate immediately B.C. dentist died from COVID-19, family confirms   Ontario let dental-care partners know of the potential risk, but has not revealed publicly how many cases have been traced back to the event. Quebec says it doesn't appear that many of its positive tests are linked. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island say no cases there go back to the conference. Manitoba hasn't revealed any possible connections either. Although the first death in the province from COVID-19 was a woman in her 60s who worked for a dental supply company. That company had a booth at the Vancouver conference. The company directed The Canadian Press to speak with provincial health officials. Some attendees may have contracted the virus but never showed symptoms. ' Unpredictable' \"[Infectious diseases] are unpredictable,\" says Jason Kindrachuk, a research chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba. Kindrachuk says public health officials made decisions based on the information they had early on. There were \"unfortunate misnomers:\ " believing the virus only affected seniors or people with underlying health conditions, and that only those showing symptoms could spread it. We now know a lot more people can be at risk and can unknowingly be carriers, Kindrachuk says. The situation across Canada has been changing daily as positive COVID-19 test results continue to rise. Some of those cases have been linked to other super-spreading events. More than 50 doctors from Western Canada were at a curling bonspiel March 11-14 in Edmonton, where an individual unknowingly spread the virus after returning from a trip to Las Vegas, said Alberta's chief medical health officer. Attendees from multiple provinces have since tested positive. At the time, events with less than 250 people could go ahead.   13 cases of COVID-19 linked to curling bonspiel attended by doctors from across western Canada Alberta sees two more COVID-19 deaths, 117 new cases   A snowmobile rally where more than 100 people gathered for supper in Saskatchewan on March 14 has been connected to nearly 20 cases. And more than 100 positive cases, including one death, have been linked to funeral services in St. John's, N.L. Across the country, as more information came in, large-scale events were cancelled, then smaller events. Then it was recommended people only be around those they live with. Recommendations from health officials and politicians became orders.   I know that we can come together by staying apart.- Alyson Kelvin Alyson Kelvin is an assistant professor at Dalhousie University Toronto campus and a research scientist at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology. She says we're still in the early stages of understanding COVID-19. Just a few weeks ago, there wasn't much evidence of community transmission in Canada. Scientists are now learning how long the virus survives on different surfaces and how easily it can be spread even at small events. \"There's a big difference between a couple of weeks ago and now,\ " Kelvin says. Our understanding of how it is shared by children is also changing. Kelvin studied research out of China that traced children in households where people had tested positive. It showed that many children had contracted the virus but weren't showing any symptoms. \"This trend could continue in Canada or the U.S., where we have children being able to be infected and spread or transmit the virus and not even know that they had it.\ " Normal life may seem like ages ago, Kelvin adds, but efforts to slow down the pandemic's spread are just beginning. And super-spreading events show just how important it is to keep social distancing. \"I know Canadians can do it because we have a great sense of our community in our country. Even though we are spread out, I know that we can come together by staying apart.\ "  
  As rumours continue to pop up about the novel coronavirus outbreak, experts in health and pandemics are reminding British Columbians to stick to reliable sources and keep things in perspective. When provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry revealed Tuesday that the first presumptive case of the virus has been found in B.C., she addressed some misleading social media gossip about the spread of the disease, including false reports about new cases. \"I think we need to take all those rumours with a grain of salt and recognize that they are just that — rumours,\ " Henry said. \"We will tell you immediately, as we have today, if someone tests positive for coronavirus.\" VideoHealth officials 'confident' first case of coronavirus has been found in B.C. Health officials say the overall risk to the public is low and the province is well prepared to deal with infections. B.C.'s single patient is currently recovering at home. There are still countless questions about the respiratory infection, which first appeared in China's Hubei province last month, but experts say initial signs suggest it isn't quite as serious as some other diseases that have caused worldwide fear. Putting things in perspective Dr. Michael Curry, a University of B.C. professor and emergency room doctor at Delta Hospital, points out that about 98 per cent of patients have survived the infection so far. As of Tuesday, Chinese state media were reporting 132 deaths out of 5,974 confirmed cases — and no one has died from the virus outside of China. Compared that to something like SARS, which had a death rate of about eight per cent during the 2003 epidemic. \"We deal with influenza on almost an annual basis, and influenza does kill several thousand Canadians a year,\ " Curry told CBC. Health Canada estimates that the flu causes about 3,500 deaths annually in Canada. Health officials are \"confident\" the first case of novel coronavirus has been found in B.C. We're separating fact from fiction on the new coronavirus. What do you want to know about it? 28:21 Curry also points out that the seriousness of newly discovered viruses tends to be exaggerated in the early stages of an outbreak. \"As we gain more experience with the virus , we realize there's people that aren't coming to hospital with it, there's people that aren't getting tested for it. We recognize the sickest of the sick upfront,\" he said. Managing outbreak anxiety Nonetheless, doctors still know very little about how quickly the virus might spread and how dangerous it will ultimately turn out to be, and that can lead to understandable unease. That's a subject UBC professor and clinical psychologist Dr. Steven Taylor has studied in detail. His latest book is called The psychology of pandemics: Preparing for the next global outbreak of infectious disease. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine Taylor said a small but significant segment of the population tends to develop excessive anxiety during an outbreak, and those people interpret every cough as a sign of infection. \"SARS has been described as a mental health catastrophe,\" he said. \"Many people developed post-traumatic stress disorder.\ " He said anyone who's feeling stressed out by the coronavirus outbreak should try to find a way to live with the uncertainty about what the future might bring. \"We don't have the answers, and they just need to sit tight and manage their anxieties or apprehensions about this virus as best as they can,\ " Taylor said. At 35 weeks pregnant, B.C. woman desperate to get out of WuhanToronto dad calls on Ottawa to help get his stranded toddler out of Wuhan One thing that might help is tuning out rumours and hoaxes that could cause panic. Henry, the provincial health officer, said people need to make sure they turn to credible sources of information for the latest news on the coronavirus. Here in British Columbia, that's the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, which is providing regular updates.

Two seniors exercise in a park during a suspension of the curfew in Belgrade, as Serbian authorities eased some of the strict measures that have been in place against the pandemic. (Darko Vojinovic/The Associated Press) Putting off kids' vaccines during COVID-19 heightens risk of other outbreaks With daycares and schools closed across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, immunization requirements aren't being enforced by public health officials. That has doctors worried about a possible surge in measles, whooping cough and other serious, vaccine-preventable illnesses. The Canadian Paediatric Society is urging family physicians and other clinicians to ensure young patients don't miss their vaccines. Dr. Joan Robinson, a spokesperson for the society, said keeping children at home won't completely protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases. \"Meningitis can be acquired from a completely healthy child or adult who carries the bacteria in the nose or throat,\" said Robinson. Not all medical clinics and doctor's offices have the infrastructure or enough personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves and masks to offer routine vaccinations safely. Many clinics are closed altogether for the time being, amid quarantine measures imposed by the provinces and territories. Dr. Daniel Flanders, a pediatrician in Toronto, has come up with a creative way to inoculate his young patients: he is administering driveup vaccinations in the alley behind his office. Physicians and public health experts warn that a delay in immunizing even a small number of children heightens the risk of non-COVID outbreaks. Pediatricians say they understand if inoculations can't take place for a month or two. But once restrictions start to reach three months or more, they worry that the herd immunity rates that protect vulnerable individuals in the community could crumble. \"This pandemic is bad enough,\ " Flanders said. \"If we layer on top of that vaccine-preventable infection outbreaks, that is really unthinkable.\ " The World Health Organization — which recently listed vaccine hesitancy as a global public health threat, along with pandemic — is equally concerned. The United Nations health body said Thursday that when immunization services are disrupted, even for brief periods during emergencies, then the risk increases for outbreaks of measles and polio.

Plus in this extended version, the panellists look at the many crises since the start of 2020 — and what they've done to the government. 17:11 IN BRIEF Trudeau to speak with premiers about reopening the economy Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will discuss the process of restarting parts of the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic with premiers today. The question of how and when to reopen is one being debated across Canada and in many regions of the world that have seen some progress in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Some provinces, including hard-hit Quebec and Ontario, have been seeing hundreds of new cases daily, while others, including New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, have gone several days with no new cases. Trudeau stressed that \"getting back to normal will not happen overnight\" and will require co-ordination at the national level to ensure governments are working with similar principles and guidelines. On Thursday, Saskatchewan unveiled a multiphase plan to reopen, while New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs released early details of a phased reopening plan for that province this afternoon. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his government will offer some details early next week about its opening plans. Read more about the situation in Canada Health experts reject Trump's suggestion to ingest disinfectant to kill COVID-19 Doctors and health experts urged people not to drink or inject disinfectant today after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that scientists should investigate inserting the cleaning agent into the body as a way to combat COVID-19. \"[This is an] absolutely dangerous, crazy suggestion,\ " said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia. Reckitt Benckiser, which manufacturers household disinfectants Dettol and Lysol, said in a statement that \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body [through injection, ingestion or any other route].\ " The White House said today that Trump had been taken out of context and had urged people to seek coronavirus treatment only after conferring with their doctors. Trump himself offered a different explanation from the White House while signing the latest coronavirus relief bill, stating he was being sarcastic. Read more reaction from experts   Canadian government offers rent relief for businesses Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced a new rent subsidy program to help businesses forced to shut down because of the global pandemic. The rent relief plan, to be funded jointly with the provinces, will provide non-repayable loans to commercial property owners to cover 50 per cent of rent payments for April, May and June. The loans will be forgiven if the property owner agrees to cut the rent by at least 75 per cent for those months and promises not to evict the tenant. The small business tenant must cover the remaining portion of the rent, which would be up to 25 per cent. To qualify, small business tenants must pay less than $50,000 a month in rent. They also must have experienced a revenue decline of at least 70 per cent from pre-COVID-19 levels or they must have been forced to close down because of pandemic restrictions. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) welcomed the rent relief program but warned that it may be too complicated and too reliant on landlords to administer. It also criticized the requirement that a qualifying business report a loss of 70 per cent of its revenues, saying that might disqualify some hard-hit businesses.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: By definition, herd immunity evolves when a sufficient portion of the population becomes immune to a disease. When it comes to COVID-19, herd immunity means the virus would not be able to spread on its own, according to Erin Strumpf, a health economics expert at McGill University. \"It's not prevention of a disease, per se, but it's prevention of an epidemic.\ " Most experts suggest herd immunity cannot be achieved safely without a vaccine because seniors and other vulnerable populations with suppressed immune systems would be at risk and hospitals would be overwhelmed. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said herd immunity without a vaccine is \"theoretically possible\" if everyone, or almost everyone, who becomes infected develops antibodies that will protect them for life. While that might happen, \"we don't know that [yet],\" said McGeer. \"It would just be foolish to count on it, which is why we're working on vaccines.\" AND FINALLY...

  This column is an opinion by Scott Mitchell, who teaches at Carleton University in the School of Journalism and Communication.  His research focuses on media coverage of contagious disease outbreaks, as well as risk communication, perception, and behaviour.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. When this coronavirus outbreak is over – and at some point, it will be over – how do we ensure that we learn the right lessons? There's a real chance that the public health response will paradoxically be \"too good.\ " By that I mean that when we look back at all this, some people might say, 'why did we have all these public health measures, systemic responses, news coverage, and resources devoted to dealing with the pandemic, when things ultimately turned out OK?' This might sound like ridiculous circular logic, and in some ways it is.   Maybe these considerations seem premature, because COVID-19 is still unfolding and there's a lot of uncertainty. No one can say for sure what the future holds. But I'm concerned that eventually the public might have this kind of response to COVID-19, because it's what happened to an extent after the 2003 SARS epidemic, and it's what has happened in many other past situations involving risk, uncertainty, and extensive news coverage.   Of course, COVID-19 is not SARS. We already know there are meaningful differences between the two outbreaks. But this is the time to be anticipating different future outcomes and public reactions, and thinking about how to deal with them. In fact, we're already seeing these kinds of conversations unfold not just among the public, but among leading epidemiologists. People are simply bad at remembering how they felt and acted in the past. There are those today in the U.S. who would not admit to voting for George W. Bush, for example, because in hindsight they feel differently now about his presidency than when they cast their ballot for him – and thus they remember their own past feelings and actions differently. In other words, their current feelings override their memories of past feelings and actions. This weird cultural memory – this collective act of forgetting – also happens with contagious disease outbreaks. A sign taped to a post gives instructions on measures to take against COVID-19 in downtown Ottawa on April 6. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) During the 2014 Ebola crisis, people in North America were anxious about a domestic outbreak – an unrealistic, unproductive anxiety that impeded public health measures. But looking back now, do those people clearly remember the Ebola crisis? Do they remember their feelings accurately? Do they realize that they panicked unnecessarily, and that health authorities' reassurances were indeed accurate? If people came to grips with the truth of all those memories, perceptions, and ultimate realities, it could lead to more productive responses to future public health crises – but typically, people don't really do that. There are three prime considerations here:   People forgetting how they felt in the midst of a crisis, when looking back on it. That old saying: \"When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.\ " How COVID-19 has been mediated — through the news, social media, public health messaging, and other sources.   That last consideration is a major one. Even after decades of research in communication and journalism studies, many questions remain about where people get their information, how they process it, and the impact is has on perceptions and decision-making. At the very least, my own research and other work suggests that news and social media do play an important role in public perceptions, and ultimately, policy responses and outcomes when it comes to contagious diseases. The unproductive anxiety about Ebola in 2014 led to harmful measures being taken, such as border closures and travel bans, that ultimately restricted efforts to contain the virus, for example.   So far, we know that news coverage and the broader response to COVID-19 has not been perfect. Some officials and institutions have responded much better than others. We've seen the spread of misinformation, and there have been failures to respond efficiently or effectively.   The important point here is that we are going to get through this, and once we're on the other side, we'll want to remember what actually happened, what information was correct, what worked, and what didn't. We have to try to remain aware of our own feelings and perceptions, and how they can affect the memory of events. It sounds obvious and reductive, but that's the only way to learn and get better. A park closed by COVID-19 in Ottawa. (Jean-Sébastien Marier/Radio-Canada) So how do we encourage that sort of accurate reflective process, which is the starting point for any kind of positive change? We've already seen some collective re-writing of memories in the past few weeks. In late February and early March, there still seemed to be much public uncertainty in Canada about whether the situation was serious enough to require people to cancel vacations, work from home if possible, and minimize social contact. Many government agencies and health authorities described the personal risk of the virus as low. Then suddenly everything changed, seemingly overnight We're now seeing harsh criticism of these early responses, which in some cases may be warranted. Yet is it fair to criticize the effectiveness of disease surveillance programs and early public health responses, after we've sat back and watched for years while funding has been reduced, pandemic preparedness teams have been disbanded, and international disease surveillance has been scaled back? If we want to avoid being surprised by a developing pandemic again in the future and minimize the harm when an outbreak does happen, then we need to provide the necessary funding and resources. That means accurately detailing how the COVID-19 outbreak unfolded, how we reacted for better or worse, and what was needed to address it. And then we need to put measures in place for the next time. Opinion4 crucial health-care lessons Canada needs to learn from COVID-19OpinionWhy communities need to move fast, get creative to protect homeless from COVID-19 I don't want to sound cavalier or minimize a situation involving real harm and death, but there could eventually be some positive outcomes from COVID-19. There could be greater public understanding of the importance of devoting resources to public health responses, recognition of the need for paid sick days, increased funding for hospital beds, and many other kinds of capacity-building that aren't just useful during a pandemic, but which can literally make the world a better, happier place over the long term. Maybe health- and risk-communication will change: we're not only learning more about social distancing and other infection control measures, but we're also figuring out how to communicate that information to the public and enact behavioural change in the midst of a crisis. It's hard to know what will be different once we get through this. At the very least, people will wash their hands more.    This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Canada hit a grim milestone Wednesday as the number of deaths across the country from COVID-19 exceeded 2,000, and later the number of overall cases topped 40,000.  More than half of the deaths have come in long-term care homes, which have been hard hit by the pandemic, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.   The news came as Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced he will be calling in the military to help deal with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in the province's long-term care homes.   Ford says he will formally request extra resources from the federal government today, including from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Forces personnel, specifically to help in five priority homes. He compared the situation in long-term care settings to a \"raging wildfire\" during his Wednesday news conference. Canadian Forces personnel have already been deployed to Quebec to help out in the hard hit long-term care facilities there. On Wednesday, Premier François Legault said he's asked the federal government to send 1,000 additional soldiers to help staff the  institutions. Legault told reporters at his daily briefing that he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students.

Premier François Legault said he has asked the federal government to send another 1,000 soldiers. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) The number of residences in Quebec considered to be in a \"critical situation\" nearly doubled in the past week, going from 41 to 80.   In all, approximately 850 of the 1,041 people who have died from COVID-19 in Quebec were residents of CHSLDs or seniors' homes. In Ontario, 128 residences are currently dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks. As of today, there have been at least 448 deaths in long-term care amid outbreaks at 127 facilities. Ontario is also expanding COVID-19 testing to every resident and worker in long-term care homes. Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at Toronto's Sinai Health System, says testing is only one part of the problem. \"We can test everyone and have the info to show the extent of the problem, but can you actually act on that information?\ " he said in an interview with CBC News. \"Do you actually have the space to isolate people so that you're not causing more spread within the home? \"Do you have the personal protective equipment to support having staff members go between residents' rooms? Do you have the health and human resources to provide the care that they need?\ " WATCH | Dr. Nathan Small says not enough attention was given to long-term care homes during pandemic planning.   Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician from Sinai Health System, says there wasn't enough attention paid to long-term care residences during pre-pandemic planning. 1:16 Speaking at the daily briefing by cabinet members and federal health officials, Tam again said that continued vigilance is essential and highlighted the continued concern around long-term care facilities. \"As we continue to make progress in slowing the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing some bumps in the road that remind us we can't let down our guard.\" Tam said protections are also needed at other high-risk settings where people live in close contact and share common spaces, citing seniors' homes and homeless shelters. WATCH | WHO's Dr. Mike Ryan says countries will need to figure out how to minimize risk in long-term care homes: It's important to minimize the risk of bringing the virus into long-term homes and respond quickly when it appears, says Mike Ryan of the WHO's Emergencies Program. 2:36 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday reiterated that the federal government is talking with provinces around support for long-term care homes, which are provincially regulated. Trudeau last week said the federal government was planning to consult with the provinces on topping-up wages of lower paid essential workers, but it's not yet clear how or when that might happen.   LISTEN |  Family stories lead to revelation: 31 deaths inside care home   Restarting the economy Trudeau also said the federal government is co-ordinating with provinces and territories about how to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic — but he said each will make its own decision given the different circumstances of every region. \"We recognize that different provinces will make different decisions about how and where to start restarting and reopening their economies,\ " Trudeau said Wednesday during his daily briefing. The decision around when to reopen the border with the U.S. is a nationwide measure and any change in that decision will come from the federal government, he said. WATCH | Ontario calls for military help for long-term care: Ontario has called for the military to help with the COVID-19 crisis in long-term care homes as it also implements increased testing in the facilities. 2:03 A federal official Wednesday expressed concerns that Indigenous communities will face elevated risks of COVID-19 infections once provinces and urban centres begin easing lockdown restrictions.   Valerie Gideon, senior assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, says COVID-19 rates in Indigenous communities are currently running below the national percentage due to protection efforts.   \"There are communities that are 20 minutes from an urban centre. Some communities are in the middle of an urban centre. It is impossible for those communities to be completely closed off if cities decide to open up their operations.\" Trudeau's remarks come a day after Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam made similar remarks. Tam, who was speaking at a daily briefing on Tuesday, urged continued vigilance around public health measures and said steps taken by Canadians across the country to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have prevented an explosion of cases.   Tam said Tuesday that health officials across the country are closely monitoring for \"continued and stable slowing of the epidemic\" as they plan for what comes next. \"But we are still a ways off and the path remains uncertain,\ " Tam said, adding that she knows questions around recovery and what comes next are on everyone's mind. While there are a lot of unknowns about the path forward, Tam said the actions Canadians have taken in recent weeks have been critical to slowing the spread of the virus. \"There is no doubt that our sacrifices and every day inconveniences over the past weeks have prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada like the ones that have overwhelmed health-care systems in places like Italy, Spain and New York.\ "  'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Why COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think   The virus, which was first identified in China in late 2019, causes an illness called COVID-19. There's no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus, though researchers around the world are searching for potential treatments.   Support for students Strict public health measures meant to clamp down on the virus have led to huge financial strain for families and businesses, as well as for governments tasked with overseeing the response and assisting those who have lost income. The federal government and provinces have launched a range of initiatives aimed at supporting families and businesses, but some critics argue that the funding has been both too narrow and too slow. Trudeau on Wednesday said the government plans to roll out funding and expanded job placement programs for post-secondary students who are struggling to find enough work during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left thousands of Canadians infected and prompted health officials to introduce a range of measures aimed at keeping people home.

  We're breaking down what you need to know about the pandemic by answering your questions. You can send your questions via email at COVID@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday on our website, and we're also putting some of your questions to the experts on the air during The National and News Network.    So far we've received more than 20,000 emails from all corners of the country, including a number of questions about whether the virus can be transmitted through your ears, and how UV light could be harnessed to clean personal protective equipment (PPE) including this question from Laurie D.   Does ultraviolet light destroy the virus? Can it be used on PPE? Sunlight emits three types of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but only one type, called UVC radiation, has the power to kill viruses. UVC is filtered out by the earth's atmosphere, but scientists discovered how to artificially generate UVC to destroy microorganisms back in 1878.   UVC is now being used to disinfect a lot of different things including drinking water, laboratory equipment and hospitals, where some health-care facilities hard hit by COVID-19 are deploying high-tech UV light robots to zap germs. But it's not clear whether UVC tech can be used to disinfect PPE. A spokesperson for Xenex Disinfection Services, which manufactures germ-zapping robots, told CBC News some hospitals are using their LightStrike robots to disinfect N95 respirator masks so they can be reused. \"We are absolutely humbled to be in a position to help in the United States and across the globe,\ " said company spokesperson Irene Hahn. COVID-19 vaccine research takes on new urgency Ron Hofmann, president of the International Ultraviolet Association and an expert in the use of UV light to treat water, said \"we're figuring things out on the fly.\ " He said new information is arriving \"almost daily as we try to determine how to reuse the N95 respirator masks and other critical PPE that was never designed to be reused.\ " Other experts agree this is new territory in the fight against COVID-19. Bill Anderson, a chemical engineering professor at the University of Waterloo, said \"since PPE differs in materials, sizes, shapes, there will always be a little uncertainty about disinfection.\" Another challenge is figuring out how to get UV light into all the little crevices and shadows in the interior of PPE where particles of the virus could be hiding, he said.   Health Canada is monitoring how single use medical devices such as N95 masks could be safely reused during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Here is a list of approved hard surface disinfectants for use against COVID-19. Remember, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is your best protection against the virus. How do the doctors anticipate we return to a new normal? Weeks have passed since the Canadian government and health officials began encouraging physical distancing and isolation measures.  Canadians, including Dave B., are starting to wonder what's next. How do we return back to our regular lives and what does that look like? Dr. Michael Curry, an emergency room doctor at Delta Hospital in Vancouver and a professor at the University of British Columbia, predicts we'll return to \"a new normal\" gradually, dubbing the process a \"phased return.\ " However, he explains that two variables will impact how those phases are carried out: antibody testing and a vaccine. Antibody testing \"may let us know who has been exposed to it and presumably may be immune to the COVID infection,\" said Dr. Curry. This could be valuable information when deciding who is able to return to work first. Dr. Curry also mentions the prospect of a vaccine, which right now is estimated to be released in 2021. \"Good antibody testing showing immunity or a vaccine would change those [phased return] plans dramatically.\ "  You can watch more of Dr. Michael Curry's answers on The National here: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including if there’s any way of knowing how many asymptomatic people could be walking around when only symptomatic people are being tested.   4:20 Do you believe there will be a vaccine? On the subject of vaccines, here's a question from Renee answered on CBC News Network's Morning Live with Heather Hiscox. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease specialist at the University Health Network, said he is confident there will be a vaccine.   \"I really always bet on human ingenuity.\ " He says there are currently more than 40 \"very qualified research groups and vaccine-specific groups\" working on the development of the vaccine using a variety of methods.  Some have started human trials.   So will a vaccine be ready in 12-18 months? Dr. Bogoch couldn't confirm. \"Your guess is as good as mine ... but hopefully it's sooner rather than later.\"   Can the virus go through your ears? By now, you've probably heard it a hundred times: Avoid touching your face because contaminated hands can spread the virus to your mouth, eyes or nose. But Joseph T. sent us an email wondering whether the virus can be transmitted through the ears. Here's what we know: A COVID-19 infection occurs when droplets containing the virus make contact with a mucosal membrane  —  the soft linings on our eyes, nose, mouth and elsewhere — including in the inner lining of our middle ears, which connects to the nose and mouth.   However, it would be unlikely coronavirus droplets could enter through that lining, said Dr. Raiyan Chowdhury, a critical care and ears, nose, throat specialist.   Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada He said the ear has various defences that shield it from viruses; the ear canal and the ear drum protect the mucosal membrane. Ear wax also acts as a natural barrier. All these defences would have to fail, or there would have to be a hole in the eardrum, for the coronavirus to enter the ear's inner lining, he said. \"It is far more likely that a droplet would enter through your eyes, nose or mouth rather than  through a hole in your ear drum.\ " And if you are feeling squeamish about using your earbuds, he said it is not risky unless you're sharing them with other people.   \"The earphones could then act as a vector to someone else using them. If they happened to touch the ear phones and get droplets on their hands, they could then easily have it move to their eyes, nose, or mouth if they touched their face.\ " Can using ibuprofen make symptoms of COVID-19 worse and start pneumonia? This question comes from Terry M.   Right now, experts say COVID-19 patients can treat fever with ibuprofen and other drugs, despite previous confusion on their effects. The World Health Organization has clarified that advice stating there's no evidence to suggest using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition, compared to using Tylenol and other acetaminophen products, for example.

  A University of Saskatchewan research team and scientists from across the country have been awarded $1 million over two years to develop animal models and test vaccine candidates to find a vaccine for COVID-19. The project is being led by the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac), and is part of a rapid research funding initiative, designed to contribute to efforts to contain COVID-19.   PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccineSask. researchers aiming to develop a vaccine for coronavirus outbreak in China Volker Gerdts, director of VIDO-InterVac, said a race is underway to find the best animal for replicating the disease.   \"Is it mice, hamsters, or ferrets? Whichever model works best is the one we're going to use,\ " he said in a statement provided by the university.   \"Once the model is developed, we will then be able to test our vaccine candidates for effectiveness.\"   He said the virus is already being grown in VIDO-InterVac labs and the process of developing an animal model is already underway. The lab has already infected some ferrets with COVID-19. The lab's vaccine is also already being generated; Gerdts said with the money in hand, the lab can now begin testing the vaccine on animals and study the safety of the vaccine. He said once the vaccine has passed safety tests on animals, it will need to be studied in humans. Researchers also hope to better understand issues like transmission between animals, impact of age on disease and susceptibility of agricultural animals like chickens or pigs.   \"The goal is to develop a disease in these animals that is similar to humans, so that we then can use that as a read-out to show that our vaccine works, or it doesn't,\ " Gerdts told CBC News. The 12-member team is led by Darryl Falzarano. He said the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine that provides protection against multiple coronaviruses. 
  Canada is preparing to respond to a possible pandemic as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb around the globe. Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said the global threat posed by the novel coronavirus, which can lead to a respiratory illness called COVID-19, is evolving fast. While the outbreak continues to be contained mostly to the epicentre in Hubei, China, she noted that the virus is spreading now at the community level, person-to-person, in several other countries. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam says it's too early to know the trajectory of the spread of the novel coronavirus. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) \"These signs are concerning, and they mean that the window of opportunity for containment ... for stopping the global spread of the virus, is closing,\ " Tam told reporters in a teleconference Monday. \"It also tells countries like Canada, that have been able to manage and detect cases so far, that we have to prepare across governments, across communities, and as families and individuals, in the event of more widespread transmission in our community.\" Europe, Middle East scramble to limit spread of coronavirusCBC InvestigatesWhy some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claimsStock markets sell off as coronavirus spread threatens global economy The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but so far hasn't declared it a pandemic. Tam said the trajectory of the coronavirus is unknown at this time and it's possible that cases have occurred in other countries that don't have the proper tools to diagnose and contain it. Canada developed a pandemic response plan in 2009, which would serve as the foundation for any shift in the official response to the current outbreak, she said. The response plan includes accelerating research work here and contributing to international efforts to develop a vaccine abroad. Tam said it also could lead to expanding laboratory testing capabilities and access to diagnostic tools, and taking stock of essential supplies to make sure authorities don't run short. She added that Canada's course of action would be much the same whether the WHO declares a pandemic or not. Containment efforts Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday that a pandemic declaration by the WHO would render travel restrictions meaningless because it would mean that efforts to contain the virus had failed. \"As the window closes in terms of stopping the global spread, as we watch the WHO assess whether or not this is a full pandemic, obviously our attention turns more toward our domestic preparedness and what Canada can do to make sure our system and structures are ready for a change in our own population,\ " she said. The WHO said today that China has reported 77,362 cases of COVID-19, including 2,618 deaths. Outside China, there are now 2,074 cases in 28 countries, including 10 in Canada, and 23 related deaths. Despite the rising numbers, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said officials are encouraged by the fact that the number of new cases continues to decline in China. Despite concerns over the coronavirus spreading in places like Iran, South Korea and Italy, the WHO says it is not yet a pandemic. 4:09 The epidemic peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been steadily declining since, he said. Tedros said a decision on whether to declare a pandemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of the disease and its impact on society. \"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,\" he said. Pandemic potential \"Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.\" Tedros said labelling the outbreak a pandemic could create unnecessary fear. Tam said that the goal now is to slow the spread of the virus, adding it's difficult to stop its spread because more countries are reporting people with no or mild symptoms. Canada has been successful so far in detecting imported cases and preventing person-to-person spread within communities, but is preparing for other scenarios, Tam said. 4th case of coronavirus in Ontario confirmed Tam said enhanced border control measures and messaging at airports will be broadened to include warnings to travellers returning from other countries with reported cases of coronavirus. She said international travellers arriving at Canadian airports will be told to self-isolate if they're experiencing flu-like symptoms. Tam said all travellers should take general precautions and plan ahead by, for instance, making sure they have enough medication for a trip. She repeated the standard public health messages encouraging people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, keep track of federal travel health advice posted online and share travel history with health-care providers in the event of becoming sick. 
  When Quebec Premier François Legault suggested last week that schools could reopen before the planned May 4 date, the public reaction was fast and furious. More than 150,000 people signed a petition overnight, many of them parents afraid this would mean exposing their children to undue risk and encouraging the spread of the virus. Legault has since said schools will not be reopening \"in the short term.\" \"It will not be done until we have, first, the agreement of the public health, and second, that I have personally the assurance that there's no risk for the children and for the teachers,\ " Legault said this week. When the premier floated that trial balloon, Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, said reopening schools would mean that children — who are not at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 — would participate in the natural immunization of the population. A return to school this spring is possible, Legault says \"Young people who could get the disease with almost no symptoms are like being vaccinated,\ " Arruda said. \"It is natural vaccination that will take hold, and it is important in society that a certain part of the population be vaccinated.\ " In other words, Arruda wants the province to achieve herd immunity. What's herd immunity? But what exactly is herd immunity, how does it work, and are kids really the key to achieving it? By definition, herd immunity is when a large enough share of the population has been infected with a virus and is now immune, meaning the virus can't spread on its own, and its reproduction rate is below one per cent, according to Erin Strumpf, a health economics expert at McGill University. Achieving herd immunity essentially prevents the rapid increase in the rate of infection in a population, much in the way that a vaccine would. \"It's not prevention of a disease, per se, but it's prevention of an epidemic,\ " said Strumpf. An expert explains how herd immunity works, and why Quebec is still a long way off achieving it. 4:16 But experts say herd immunity cannot be achieved safely without completely isolating anyone at risk, meaning seniors and anyone with suppressed immune systems — and with the coronavirus, we are a long way from the 60 per cent immunization rate needed to acquire herd immunity. As of Wednesday, Quebec has 14,860 confirmed cases of COVID-19, but asymptomatic carriers mean the actual number of cases could be far greater, Strumpf says. \"Even if it's 10 times that figure, we're still looking at a real minority of the population in Quebec and across Canada\" with immunity, she said. What about seniors and others at risk? Even though it's rare for children to develop complications from COVID-19, sending them back to school means they're more exposed to the virus. They could catch it, Strumpf said, and pass it on to their parents, grandparents or other older people who face a higher risk of developing complications. While it's unclear how effective sick children are at transmitting the virus, Strumpf said, seniors and at-risk individuals would have to continue to self-isolate for as long as it takes to arrive at herd immunity. On top of that, immuno-compromised children and teachers, as well as teachers older than 60 and thus at higher risk, would need to be exempt from going to school or their jobs. Why wait until September? Caroline Quach, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at CHU Sainte-Justine, said as far as achieving herd immunity goes, it makes little difference whether schools reopen now or in September. (CBC) While many parents are afraid of the risks that school reopening could mean for their children, Dr. Caroline Quach, a pediatric microbiologist at Sainte-Justine hospital, said it's extremely rare for children to die or develop complications from COVID-19. \"There's a calculated risk you have to look at,\ " Quach said. \"We have to, at one point in time, stop confinement and start to live again.\ " In Quach's view, in terms of achieving herd immunity, there's not much difference between sending children back to school now or in September. \"In September, even if we're at 10 or 15 per cent, we're still far off from the 60 per cent mark that we think is needed to stop transmissions,\ " she said. Quebec mining sector reopening concerns Indigenous leaders Quach noted that in Sweden, where the government's public health directives are not as strict, and elementary schools remain open, the mortality rate is significantly below that of the worst-hit European countries, such as Italy and the U.K. However, the death rate is higher in Sweden than it is in any of the neighbouring countries in the Nordic region, including in Finland, Norway and Denmark.   Quach said allowing people to resume some activities gradually with the goal of achieving herd immunity entails separating seniors from young people — and keeping a close eye on community transmission, \"so if you see you're starting to lose control over the transmission, you have to close down again certain areas of activities.\ " Quach said the decision to reopen schools should depend on the virus data for each specific region. \"If you're in an area where things seem to be settling down, there's a point where, slowly, you'll be able to reopen various sectors without getting that curve to go completely wild. That's why you need very specific data,\ " Quach said. Experts say it will take at least 12 to 18 months for a COVID-19 vaccine to be widely available. A study from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health published Tuesday showed that \"prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022\" without a vaccine or other intervention. That study warned that \"even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.\" Still, Quebec's government is hopeful businesses will be able to reopen in the coming weeks. Legault said priority will be given to businesses where physical distancing can be maintained. Arruda compared the process to turning on a faucet — the idea will be to start returning to normal slowly and ensuring things can be done safely. 
  U.S. researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday — leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges. With a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe. \"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\" The Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. Dr. Lisa Jackson is leading the first-stage safety study of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, which was given to the first volunteer in the study by injection on Monday in Seattle. (Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press) \"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\ " Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot. She's the mother of two teenagers, and \"they think it's cool\ " that she's taking part in the study. After the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\" Just the beginning Monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Still, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\ " Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself. The City of Montreal announced it would be adding staff at the Trudeau airport to inform travellers about the risks and measures being taken associated with COVID-19. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) It's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study — in the United States, China and South Korea — next month. The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500. COVID-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, cancelling entertainment and sporting events and encouraging people to stay away from each other. Taking it slow Starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the U.S. struck early and hard by the virus. Still, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there … to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP. Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice. \"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\ " Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\" A security guard opens the door for a person entering a COVID-19 assessment facility on Saturday in Ottawa. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Most of the vaccine research underway globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected. Researchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus's genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine. The idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack — and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus. European nations grapple with a united plan to combat coronavirusNeed help with your errands? Online groups, neighbours are pitching in during coronavirus pandemic That's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it. But because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate. \"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week. The Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centres that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before COVID-19 began spreading widely in Washington state. Kaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of COVID-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 US for each clinic visit in the study. 
  A Winnipeg-based researcher is playing a key role in a national effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. University of Manitoba scientist Dr. Brian Mark is studying the molecular biology of novel coronavirus to find weakness that can be targeted for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines. \"What has to happen now is to reduce the rate of the spread so that the health-care system can cope with the number of infected people,\ " he told CBC's Janet Stewart. Mark, a professor in the university's department of microbiology, is part of one of 47 research teams across the country that received money through several agencies, non-profits and the federal government for studying coronavirus. Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced last week the federal government is spending $27 million on research with the goal of mitigating the outbreak and preventing misinformation. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the global spread of the virus a pandemic. Hours later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1-billion package — including another $275 million for more research such as vaccine development — to help Canadians cope with the outbreak. Trudeau announces $1B COVID-19 package as WHO calls global outbreak a pandemicManitoba plans to purchase $35M worth of masks, sanitizer and other gear to protect against COVID-19 Half a million dollars over two years is going to Mark and his team of two Ontario researchers, lead investigator Dr. Sachdev Sidhu of University of Toronto and Dr. Roman Melnyk of the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Mark's prior work on coronavirus is being applied to target antiviral drug strategies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. He has been trying to uncover what role proteins and enzymes play in disease, and how they can help in antibiotic drug resistance, viral immune evasion and human genetic disorders. Dr. Brian Mark of the University of Manitoba's microbiology department is examining the molecular structure of coronavirus to identify weakness that can be targeted with an antiviral drug or vaccine. (Submitted by University of Manitoba) Mark said the novel coronavirus is about 90 per cent similar to the SARS coronavirus that emerged in 2003 — except it is more infectious and less lethal. \"In fact, coronarviruses are quite well understood as far as how they're comprised and how they replicate, but there's still a significant amount of research that needs to go into developing a strategy to routinely make vaccines against them.\" Both branches of the immune system need to be tapped  — an antibody-based immune response, in which the body produces antibodies to bind onto the surface of the virus and neutralize it, and the cell-mediated response, which trains the immune system to recognize cells that are infected with the virus so they can be destroyed  — he said. Mark said he is not optimistic there will be a vaccine developed to counter this active outbreak. \"It takes time, and activating both branches of the immune system … is particularly challenging, so I would have to say the chances are lower.\" Manitoba government promises 'emergency-ready' 2020 budgetTrump sharply restricts travel between Europe and U.S. for 30 days amid coronavirus pandemic In the meantime, the research team is trying to identify a protein that the virus needs to replicate in hopes of reducing its duplication rate. Others are trying to repurpose existing drugs to treat COVID-19. \"We'll have to wait and see how that pans out,\ " he said. If successful, he said it would likely be reserved for the most vulnerable people who are extremely ill. \"If you start giving it to too many people, the virus can develop resistance quite easily to it.\" Watch what we actually know about the coronavirus: Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness? CBC News medical contributor and family physician Dr. Peter Lin breaks down the facts about what it is, where it came from, how it spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. 5:10 As of early Wednesday, Canada had 101 reported cases of COVID-19. Manitoba has no confirmed cases to date. Mark's advice for riding it out: distance yourself from people, limit travel, and postpone or limit large gatherings. \"If everybody gets infected all at once , then the health-care system will struggle, so it's social distancing and changing behaviour which can help reduce spread.\"
  Ottawa is giving $23 million to VIDO-InterVac in Saskatoon. The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre is based at the University of Saskatchewan. Half of the money is earmarked to build a pilot-scale manufacturing plant on campus to accelerate vaccine development. \"The $12 million enables us to build the facility to good manufacturing practices standards as required for human vaccine production,\" said VIDO-InterVac director Volker Gerdts. \"We expect to begin vaccine production in a little more than a year.\"   Go inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine    There is currently no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. VIDO-InterVac is the first lab in the country to have a vaccine candidate in animal testing. The vaccine was made in February, and researchers expect to know in about four weeks whether the vaccine works in an animal model. Clinical testing of this vaccine in humans could start as early as this fall. The balance of the money will go to operational funding for high-containment laboratories. 
  The threat of contracting COVID-19 can make outings feel a bit scary these days, but researchers say that shouldn't stop you from heading out on a walk. Sherry Charbonneau has been taking her baby granddaughter out in the stroller, along with her daughter, Selena Constans, every week during the pandemic.   The mother-daughter duo has noticed the recent warm weather is attracting more people onto Winnipeg's sidewalks.   \"It's hard to navigate safely and keep up the social distancing,\" said Constans. \"I'd like to honour it, but it's just hard with the increased traffic.\" Sherry Charbonneau and her daughter Selena Constans say more people are on the sidewalks during the warm springtime weather, making it harder to keep their distance from others. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) Charbonneau admits that sometimes makes her a little nervous.   \"Especially with the narrow walkways over the bridge,\" said Charbonneau, pointing to the span that connects the Osborne Village to downtown.   Food truck operators call on city to waive fees, want permission to operate in parking lots \"You can only walk single-file. So if you see people coming, you're like 'okay, get right to the side'.\" Risk 'incredibly small': microbiologist Fortunately, those types of close encounters probably aren't anything to worry about, according to microbiologist Kevin Coombs. The University of Manitoba professor told CBC News the odds of getting the virus are directly linked to the length of exposure to someone who's infected. He said the second or two it takes to pass someone on the sidewalk, probably isn't enough to catch their germs.   \"I won't say that the chance is zero, but it is incredibly small,\ " Coombs said.    Latest local news:   Manitoba to ban health-care work by one employee at multiple sites Fear around hugging, touching could be long-term consequence of COVID-19 pandemic Ring, ring: Canadians are calling each other a lot more during COVID-19 pandemic   \"If someone is exhaling once or twice while they're passing you — that's quite a bit different than if they're sitting down next to you, having a discussion, and you're breathing on each other for half an hour,\ " Coombs said.   University of Manitoba microbiologist Kevin Coombs says the risk of contracting COVID-19 while out on a walk is \"negligible.\" (Kevin Coombs) Coombs said even joggers, breathing heavily, and cyclists zipping by on bikes are unlikely to spread the virus. \"There is a theoretical risk, but it's incredibly small,\ " he said. His colleague, Andrew Halayko agrees. The University of Manitoba physiology professor and Canada Research Chair specializes in respiratory illness and environmental pathogens. Better late than never?

Halayko said the risk of contracting COVID-19 outdoors is minute, compared to the risk of exposure indoors. He said the virus would disperse in the breeze, while the tiny nanodroplets that hold the pathogen would quickly evaporate. ' Every little thing can help' Some cities, such as Montreal, have been expanding their sidewalks or making them one-way. The urban hub — considered one of the epicentres of Canada's COVID-19 outbreak — also shut down a busy bridge, allowing access only to pedestrians and cyclists. The City of Winnipeg is reviewing measures being taken in other Canadian municipalities, including sidewalk widening, a spokesperson told CBC News on Monday evening.   Coombs said while \"every little thing can help,\ " Winnipeggers shouldn't fret if their city hasn't matched those measures so far.   He said if the path in your neighbourhood is narrow, it's probably safer to hold your course than step out into the street. \"Do you want to be hit by a car or run the risk of running into someone who's infected?\" he asked, with a wry grin.   \"Weigh your chances.\" Still, Coombs advises keeping your distance as much as possible. If you're out for a stroll with someone you don't live with, for example, he recommends enjoying each other's company while staying two metres apart.

  Medical researchers are working on multiple approaches to experimental vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The federal government announced $2.7 million in funding for vaccine candidates. Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is investing more than $23 million US in the development of new vaccines against COVID-19. France's president has announced a video summit of G7 leaders on Monday to discuss co-ordinating research on vaccines and treatments as well as an economic response to the pandemic. A vaccine would prevent the pandemic from spreading as fast as it is now, said Charu Kaushic, scientific director of Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Infection and Immunity. \"It's just spreading everywhere,\ " she said. \"If we had a vaccine , we could control it.\ " Kaushic said instead of putting all its eggs in one basket, CIHR is funding multiple projects in the hopes that at least one of them will work. 2 elements to a successful vaccine  To work, a vaccine needs to succeed in getting our immune system to produce antibodies in the blood. The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it. Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs. \"Vaccines can fail because you can get very good antibodies and other things that work great in the blood, but not in the lungs. \"You may not get protective immunity at all.\" An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute in  northern Israel this month, where efforts are underway to produce a vaccine against COVID-19.   (Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty) Viruses, especially new ones, are particularly difficult because they aren't well understood. For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted. Even though multiple researchers are working on the problem, it is rare to get a new vaccine in under a year. A top U.S. health official told a House committee that human trials for a potential vaccine could begin within a few weeks with the goal of going into the arms of the general public within 12 to 18 months. Vaccine in a year?   The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \"I want to make sure people understand, and I've said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\ " NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"We mean it's record time to get it tested. It's going to take a year to a year-and-a-half to really know if it works.\" Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material from the virus in the form of nucleic acid. That tells the human body how to make proteins that mimic viral proteins and this should provoke an immune response. Currently the pandemic coronavirus has infected more than 130,000 people worldwide.  While most people have mild respiratory symptoms, a vaccine would be a safer way to protect people because it would reduce the risk of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Denis Leclerc, an infectious diseases researcher at Laval University in Quebec City, said the advantage of nucleic acid vaccines like Moderna's is that they're much faster to produce than other types. Denis Leclerc and his colleagues at Laval University are hoping to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled in case of future outbreaks.   (Radio-Canada) While relatively safe, nucleic acid vaccines are generally not the preferred strategy, Leclerc said, because they don't have the same safety record as the traditional approach. Leclerc's team has a different approach. They are working with a small part of a protein from the virus that can be synthesized quickly and then attached to a platform to trigger an efficient immune response in humans. \"I was thinking of still using proteins to conserve very high safety and still get speed,\ " Leclerc said. His team has animal data showing this approach might work for coronavirus and for other viruses that emerge in future. Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study revealsAs coronavirus spread speeds up, Montreal researchers will trial an anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 in China Leclerc expects the proof-of-concept experiments for his COVID-19 vaccine will be ready in six months. Even though it's fast to develop, it may come too late for the current pandemic of COVID-19. That's what happened with Canada's Ebola vaccine. The experiments happened years previously, but the vaccine wasn't manufactured in time for the 2014 epidemic that ravaged West Africa. The Ebola vaccine is being used now to control Congo's outbreak. These Quebec professors are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccineFrom test strips to llama antibodies, U of O researchers take on COVID-19 Elsewhere in Quebec City, the biotech firm Medicago is producing another potential COVID-19 vaccine that uses particles that mimic the virus. Researchers will mass produce that vaccine candidate quickly in plants instead of the slower traditional way of using animal cells or eggs. The company is using the same approach to produce seasonal flu vaccines, in an effort under review by Health Canada. 
  Canada has invested about two million dollars in its campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council. Now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is investing more than a week of his own time in a trip that aims to corral African votes for Canada's bid. It's not just a week out of his schedule. He's linking himself personally to a charm campaign that may fail, said Fen Hampson, chancellor's professor at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. \"He's obviously putting his reputation on the line by going there,\ " Hampson said. Trudeau is also leaving the country at a moment when the spread of the novel coronavirus in China is fuelling fears of a global pandemic. So how likely is it that this campaign will pay off and win Canada that coveted seat? And is the goal actually worth all the effort? The seat in question is one of two assigned to the Western Europe and Other States group, which includes Canada, Australia and New Zealand along with most of Western Europe (minus France and Britain, which are permanent members of the Security Council along with the U.S., Russia and China). The inside track Canada's rivals for the spot are Norway and Ireland. They have an inside track because they're European countries and a lot of other European countries are inclined to vote for them. \"We came into this really late,\" said Adam Chapnick, professor of Defence Studies at the Royal Military College of Canada and author of the book Canada on the United Nations Security Council: A Small Power on a Large Stage. \"Never in our history have we jumped into a campaign for two Western European and Other seats when there are two other countries already campaigning. It works against us to be in a contested campaign. It works against us even more to be the last one in. The Irish have been in for over a decade.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds up an Irish themed rugby shirt during a press conference with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Farmleigh House, Dublin, Ireland, July 4, 2017. (Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters) And both Ireland and Norway are model global citizens who outdo Canada on the world stage in the generosity of their foreign aid budgets (and in peacekeeping, in Ireland's case). Trudeau's trip to the African Union summit in Addis Ababa isn't even an original idea; Norway's Erne Solberg did the same thing last year.  Even as Trudeau's plane was in the air, the Norwegian government announced Friday that Solberg would also attend the meetings in Addis Adaba this weekend.  Norway also has spent about 50 per cent more than Canada on advancing its bid. It all suggests an uphill battle. But there's another consideration that may favour the Europeans even more. The Palestinian question About 80 African and Islamic countries have tended to identify strongly with the Palestinian cause, using their UN votes to punish countries they see as taking Israel's side. Canada has for years made a point of voting against resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — including those that accord with Canada's own positions and laws — to argue that there is an excessive and unhealthy focus on the Jewish state at the UN. It's one of the main reasons why, under the government of Stephen Harper, Canada failed to secure a Security Council seat. Prime Minister Stephen Harper speaks at the UN Security Council in New York Sept. 24, 2014. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird listens in at left. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) And although the Trudeau government recently modified its voting behaviour by supporting resolutions on Palestinians' right to self-determination, it's still firmly in the small pro-Israel camp at the UN. Norway, meanwhile, is the country that famously hosted the Oslo Accords talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and has a long history of peacemaking. Norway's popular UN ambassador, Mona Juul, herself played a role in bringing the two sides together for the Oslo talks 27 years ago. Because of its own history of colonialism and rebellion, Ireland may be the Western country that most strongly supports Palestinian self-determination. The Tunisia test Next week, that issue will come before the Security Council as Tunisia — one of three African countries on the Security Council — brings forward a motion condemning the peace plan produced by President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The U.S. badly wants to avoid having to use its veto in the chamber and is lobbying the temporary members to help it dodge that outcome. If that vote is confined to the Security Council, Canada won't have to take a position (there are benefits to not being a member of the Security Council). U.S. President Donald Trump passes his adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner during a Hanukkah Reception at the White House in Washington Dec. 7, 2017.   (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) But the issue may come before the UN General Assembly before the Security Council election on June 17, so Canada may be forced to take sides publicly. It's unlikely that Canada would support a plan that flagrantly disregards existing Security Council resolutions, and so its choices are probably between rejecting the plan and abstaining from the vote. Canada almost certainly would cast its abstention as something motivated by a desire to avoid a vote that would do nothing to advance peace. That might avoid raising tensions with Washington — but it also would harm its chances of winning the Security Council election. What's it all for? Given the steep odds, is the prize worth the investment and the political risks for the Trudeau government? The Security Council \"has become much more gridlocked, hostage to Great Power politics,\" said Hampson. \"If we do win, we may find there is not a whole lot we can actually do in terms of promoting a Canadian agenda on the council.\ " There was a period following the Cold War when there was more room for middle powers with temporary seats to advance their agendas. But as the U.S., China and Russia have reverted to old rivalries, the situation has changed, said Hampson. \"The fundamental problem with the Security Council is that it's not prepared to take action because the great powers have rival interests,\ " he said. \"Nowhere is that more evident than in what has been an ongoing crisis and bloodbath in Syria.\ " Still, Hampson said, Canada sees a strong UN as something in its interest, and wants to defend the institution at a time when it is under attack from the Trump administration. Chapnick said being on the council would give Canada important face time with more powerful nations and could help it resolve its own issues with permanent members like China. Friends in Africa? For Canada, Africa represents a rich vein of 54 unpredictable votes that could give Canada the boost it needs. Much of the continent is francophone, including Senegal, one of the stops on Trudeau's tour. About 40 per cent of Canada's international aid budget goes to Africa. Ethiopia, the first stop on the tour, receives the most — about $200 million a year. Ireland is more generous on a per capita basis, and has an aggressive plan to boost its aid spending even further. But it is also a much smaller country than Canada, with a total foreign aid budget about a fifth the size. (Norway's is closer.) Canada's UN Ambassador Marc-Andre Blanchard won't say how many votes he's counting on from the continent. \"That number is a secret that our competitors dream of knowing, but we're not going to say,\" he told CBC News. Blanchard does say that Canada will \"make no compromise on values, and especially not on human rights, in the context of our bid for a UN Security Council seat.\ " A health worker, left, injects a man with an Ebola vaccine in Conakry, Guinea, March 7, 2015. Canada donated 800 doses of its experimental vaccine, a supply that existed because Canadian scientists at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg arranged for the manufacture of the vaccine — something normally done by a private drug company. (Youssouf Bah/The Associated Press) Canada has much to offer African countries where two-thirds of citizens are under 30 and half are unemployed or under-employed, he said. \"We are a champion in infrastructure. We're a champion in innovation. We're a champion in entrepreneurship. We're known for that. Those are all things Africa needs.\" Blanchard cited Sierra Leone as an African country where Canada has been a long-term partner: \"We helped them to establish peace after eight years of civil war. We helped them through their Ebola outbreak. We helped when they had a major landslide. We helped them get through three presidential elections, which are always moments of fragility in a vulnerable country after a conflict.\ " Asked if that entitles Canada to expect Sierra Leone's vote, Blanchard just laughed. 6 things we learned from Dominic Barton's appearance before a committee of MPsAnalysisDoes Canada have a 'moral and legal obligation' to allow climate migrants?Palestinians angrily reject Trump's Middle East peace plan Pressing the flesh In the context of UN politics, Trudeau's in-person charm offensive in Africa makes sense, said Hampson. \"If you are serious about running for the council, you have to be seen, you have to be visible, you have to be visiting the different regional neighbourhoods and doing good old fashioned arm-twisting and lobbying other countries to vote for you,\ " he said. Chapnick said that although Canada is coming from behind, it still has a fighting chance. \"It seems to me that the government is reasonably confident that it is not out of this bid. Otherwise, you wouldn't see the prime minister himself using valuable political capital,\ " he said. \"These things really do matter, especially with some of the small states, where a visit from a G7 prime minister, a prime minister who is still quite popular around the world, can do wonders for that government's popularity.\ " Chapnick said that there also will be behind-the-scenes horse-trading if Canada is serious about winning votes. And just as Canada can't count on promises of support — as it learned to its cost during its last bid in 2010 — neither can the Irish or the Norwegians. \"These things are unpredictable. It's amazing what an aggressive vote swap campaign can do. And countries lie.\ "
  Medical researchers are working on multiple approaches to experimental vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The federal government announced $2.7 million in funding for vaccine candidates. Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is investing more than $23 million US in the development of new vaccines against COVID-19. France's president has announced a video summit of G7 leaders on Monday to discuss co-ordinating research on vaccines and treatments as well as an economic response to the pandemic. A vaccine would prevent the pandemic from spreading as fast as it is now, said Charu Kaushic, scientific director of Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Infection and Immunity. \"It's just spreading everywhere,\ " she said. \"If we had a vaccine , we could control it.\ " Kaushic said instead of putting all its eggs in one basket, CIHR is funding multiple projects in the hopes that at least one of them will work. 2 elements to a successful vaccine  To work, a vaccine needs to succeed in getting our immune system to produce antibodies in the blood. The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it. Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs. \"Vaccines can fail because you can get very good antibodies and other things that work great in the blood, but not in the lungs. \"You may not get protective immunity at all.\" An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute in  northern Israel this month, where efforts are underway to produce a vaccine against COVID-19.   (Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty) Viruses, especially new ones, are particularly difficult because they aren't well understood. For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted. Even though multiple researchers are working on the problem, it is rare to get a new vaccine in under a year. A top U.S. health official told a House committee that human trials for a potential vaccine could begin within a few weeks with the goal of going into the arms of the general public within 12 to 18 months. Vaccine in a year?   The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \"I want to make sure people understand, and I've said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\ " NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"We mean it's record time to get it tested. It's going to take a year to a year-and-a-half to really know if it works.\" Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material from the virus in the form of nucleic acid. That tells the human body how to make proteins that mimic viral proteins and this should provoke an immune response. Currently the pandemic coronavirus has infected more than 130,000 people worldwide.  While most people have mild respiratory symptoms, a vaccine would be a safer way to protect people because it would reduce the risk of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Denis Leclerc, an infectious diseases researcher at Laval University in Quebec City, said the advantage of nucleic acid vaccines like Moderna's is that they're much faster to produce than other types. Denis Leclerc and his colleagues at Laval University are hoping to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled in case of future outbreaks.   (Radio-Canada) While relatively safe, nucleic acid vaccines are generally not the preferred strategy, Leclerc said, because they don't have the same safety record as the traditional approach. Leclerc's team has a different approach. They are working with a small part of a protein from the virus that can be synthesized quickly and then attached to a platform to trigger an efficient immune response in humans. \"I was thinking of still using proteins to conserve very high safety and still get speed,\ " Leclerc said. His team has animal data showing this approach might work for coronavirus and for other viruses that emerge in future. Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study revealsAs coronavirus spread speeds up, Montreal researchers will trial an anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 in China Leclerc expects the proof-of-concept experiments for his COVID-19 vaccine will be ready in six months.

  U.S. researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday — leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges. With a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe. \"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\" The Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. Dr. Lisa Jackson is leading the first-stage safety study of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, which was given to the first volunteer in the study by injection on Monday in Seattle. (Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press) \"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\ " Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot. She's the mother of two teenagers, and \"they think it's cool\ " that she's taking part in the study. After the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\" Just the beginning Monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Still, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\ " Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself. The City of Montreal announced it would be adding staff at the Trudeau airport to inform travellers about the risks and measures being taken associated with COVID-19. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) It's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study — in the United States, China and South Korea — next month. The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500. COVID-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, cancelling entertainment and sporting events and encouraging people to stay away from each other. Taking it slow Starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the U.S. struck early and hard by the virus. Still, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there … to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP. Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice. \"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\ " Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\" A security guard opens the door for a person entering a COVID-19 assessment facility on Saturday in Ottawa. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Most of the vaccine research underway globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected. Researchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus's genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine. The idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack — and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus. European nations grapple with a united plan to combat coronavirusNeed help with your errands? Online groups, neighbours are pitching in during coronavirus pandemic That's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it. But because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate. \"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week. The Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centres that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before COVID-19 began spreading widely in Washington state. Kaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of COVID-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 US for each clinic visit in the study.

(CBC News) House of Commons suspended amid COVID-19 aid package negotiations Shortly after House of Commons proceedings began today, the chamber suspended itself while the Liberal government and opposition parties negotiate the finer points of a bill to deliver aid to Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Opposition Conservatives have said they are not willing to vote for the bill as it is written. The Liberal government has already backed away from one controversial proposal in the bill — part 2, which would have given the government sweeping new powers to spend, borrow and tax Canadians for 21 months without parliamentary approval. The negotiations between the parties are still going on and the Commons will be suspended until there is a deal reached to define the powers Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet can use to spend public money during this crisis. Read more     Most premiers don't think Emergencies Act is needed yet, Trudeau says Every province and territory has declared either a state of emergency or a public health emergency, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said most premiers do not think it's necessary \"at this time\" to invoke the federal Emergencies Act. Trudeau said invoking the act would give the federal government special powers to co-ordinate and rearrange logistical supply chains — but most premiers on the call late Monday told the PM they don't think that's needed right now. \"I impressed on them the need to further co-ordinate and provide data on things like how many ventilators they have, so that we can make sure that they are going to the areas — maybe not in their province, but next door — that need them the most and ensure a better level of flow of emergency equipment to the places that need it,\ " Trudeau said today.

Athletes still have unanswered questions despite confirmation from the International Olympic Committee that the 2020 Tokyo Games will be postponed because of the ongoing pandemic. \"The big uncertainty is what does qualification look like?\" said Canadian wrestler Erica Wiebe, who won gold at the Rio Olympics in 2016. \"What is the actual postponement start date? Will international federations set up competitions between now and a 2021 Games to mitigate lost competition opportunities leading into a 2021 Games?

Read more ANALYSIS Why police are reluctant to ticket, arrest COVID-19 rule-breakers So far, the threats of stiff fines and even criminal charges for those flouting COVID-19 measures appear to be mostly tough talk, as authorities opt for persuasion over punishment. \"We're not as concerned with enforcement so much as the priority being getting that message across, because compliance is really our goal here,\" said Les Parker, a spokesperson for the Regina Police Service. A survey of select police forces across Canada finds little evidence that officers are busting up large gatherings or ticketing business owners who defy government calls to shutter non-essential services while the outbreak runs its course. \"We're being given that tool. However, it's the type of tool that we never wish to use, that we don't intend to use,\" said Insp. André Durocher of Montreal's police service. \"The instructions that have been given to our police officers is this is a tool to be used as an extreme last resort.\" There is also the question of whether any of these extraordinary anti-COVID measures would actually stand up in court. Martha Jackman, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said the fines and restrictions may well end up being challenged on constitutional grounds. THE SCIENCE Should healthy people wear masks while in public? No, according to Dr. Mark Loeb, because there's a shortage of masks and healthy people don't need them. Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, said people should be social distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out. \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited,\" he said. Researchers and public health officials say improper use of face masks — such as not changing disposable masks or not handwashing — could potentially increase risk of disease transmission.

  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  The Research Institute at the McGill University Health Centre is looking for volunteers to test how effective the drug hydroxychloroquine is in treating symptoms of COVID-19. The researchers say there is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), already used in Canada in the treatment of malaria and some auto-immune diseases, may be helpful to reduce the symptoms of the disease, but they don't really know yet if it works. \"We don't have any large randomized control trial data to say if it's effective,\ " said Dr. Emily McDonald, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill and the study's co-principal investigator. \"It's incredibly important that we study the safety and efficacy of HCQ in a well-designed placebo-controlled trial.\" Quebec to release COVID-19 projections, despite Horacio Arruda's reluctance to play astrologer McDonald said some studies have shown that HCQ might have antiviral properties, but this study is the first large-scale, randomized clinical study in which some participants will receive the drug and others, a placebo. Dr. Emily McDonald said promising results in earlier studies need to be confirmed in a proper placebo trial.   (Submitted by Dr. Emily McDonald) \"While there are small studies that show promising results in terms of improvement in symptoms of pneumonia,\" McDonald said, \"these results are not conclusive, and must be confirmed in a larger population of people with a proper trial.\" Researchers are hoping to find 3,000 people in Canada and the U.S. willing to take part in the trial. Some would be given the medication as a prophylactic, to try to prevent an infection; others would be using hydroxychloroquine as an early treatment for a coronavirus infection. Researchers are looking for: Adults without symptoms who have been exposed to a COVID-19 case:   You may be eligible if you live with a person known to have COVID-19, and the exposure to that person occurred within the past four days. You may be eligible if you are a health-care worker who has had contact with a patient known to have COVID-19, and the contact occurred within the past four days.   Adults with symptoms of COVID-19 (fever and/or cough and/or shortness of breath):   You may be eligible if you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (from testing), your symptoms began within the past four days, and you are currently self-isolating at home. You may be eligible if you are a health-care worker experiencing symptoms for four days or less and had contact with a patient confirmed to have COVID-19 within the last 14 days.   This study is not open to people who are already receiving hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and acute attacks of malaria. Quebec health institute advises caution in use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 Participants in the study will take the medication or the placebo over the course of five days and then complete as many as five online surveys delivered by email over two weeks. The researchers are working fast: these studies will likely be concluded within the next two months. HCQ already in use Dr. Emily McDonald, with one of the study’s principal investigators, Todd Lee, right, are leading the study into the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. (Submitted by Dr. Emily McDonald) The MUHC is already treating some patients who have COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine but only under very specific circumstances. McDonald said it all depends on how sick a patient is and whether they have underlying conditions which would react badly with the drug. \"We are judging each case, one by one,\ " she said. \"In some people who are taking chronic medications there may be interactions, and the drug can cause heart arrhythmia.\" McDonald said she can't say how the drug is working in these very ill patients. She said a separate clinical trial is underway involving those very sick patients who are given hydroxychloroquine as a last resort. She said it is too early to reveal the findings of that trial.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca   The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan to marshal Canada's scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government's strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials and expanding national testing and modelling.   $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.   In mid-March, the Trudeau government committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan's reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided the number of cases there stays low.   Premier Scott Moe said restrictions will be lifted May 4 for dentists' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers.

(Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.   For the next phases  — for which there are no start dates yet —  officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government's plan doesn't provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. ' Not exactly islands'   Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. \"Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,\ " he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. \"We are going to have to make sure we're on the same page with this.\" ' Failing our parents, our grandparents': Trudeau Trudeau said the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. \"If you're angry, frustrated, scared, you're right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders.\" WATCH | Should long-term care homes be federally regulated? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Thursday. 1:12 The comments today followed requests by Ontario and Quebec on Wednesday for hundreds of soldiers to help long-term care facilities that have been hit hard by COVID-19. The Canadian Armed Forces is now assessing what more it can provide to respond to these requests. Trudeau said the government is sending the military to help in long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec  — 130 troops were sent to help five long-term care facilities in Quebec last week  — but said it should never have come to this, and there are tough questions to be asked once the crisis is over.

(Andrew Milligan/AFP/ Getty Images) Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain was now past the peak of its coronavirus outbreak and promised to set out a lockdown exit strategy next week, despite rising deaths and criticism of his government's response.  The government has been criticized for failing to catch most cases of COVID-19 and now says wide-scale testing will be key to controlling the virus and easing a nationwide lockdown. Earlier this month it vowed to perform 100,000 tests a day by April 30. The number has been climbing steadily, but the highest daily total reached so far is 52,000. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel says authorities will allow religious services to resume and let museums, zoos, galleries and playgrounds reopen as part of the gradual loosening of the pandemic lockdown. Merkel said after meeting with governors of Germany's 16 states that it was important to remain \"disciplined\" to ensure successful efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak aren't undone.   She acknowledged the impact that the lockdown measures have had on the economy and social life, but said officials wanted to wait until next week before considering lifting restrictions on kindergartens and most schools.

The country surged past 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with approximately 1,000 reported deaths. Those are extremely low numbers compared with the experience of western Europe.  Still, many doctors — even those sympathetic to the government — have told CBC News part of the challenge is that Russia's tests return an unusually large number of false negative results.

  Three researchers at Dalhousie University in Halifax have been awarded a total of $1.9 million to help research the coronavirus and its wider societal impacts. The research areas include developing a device to gauge the severity of the illness, examining the role of public health policy and addressing the spread of misinformation. This funding is a portion of a total $27-million government investment in coronavirus research across the country announced Friday by federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu.   Dr. David Kelvin, an immunologist in Dalhousie's Faculty of Medicine, is leading a project to develop a device that would determine whether patients have a mild or severe case of COVID-19. Kelvin said his 26-person international research team will conduct a series of studies used to determine how to categorize patients in the early stages of the disease. He said the aim is to reduce the stress on emergency rooms. \"Our experience in China was that ... they were faced with thousands of people who were lined up requesting medical attention,\ " he said. \"That surge … put tremendous stress on the [emergency] room and also on the hospital, because they have a limited number of hospital beds for admission, and they have even fewer hospital beds for ICU or special treatment.\" Dr. David Kelvin's research team will focus on developing a device that will be able to tell if a person presenting with the disease will have a mild or severe case. (Submitted by David Kelvin) By developing a device or biological marker to quickly identify patients who could develop severe symptoms or require ICU admission, they could be classified and given priority for those beds, said Kelvin. Kelvin is working with the Canadian COVID-19 Research Network, which has researchers from China, Vietnam, Spain, Italy, Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, the U.S. and Canada. The team received $1 million in federal funding. Kelvin added that he's glad the government is investing in coronavirus research. \"We did go through quite a dramatic time in 2002, 2003 with SARS, and I think that taught us valuable lessons to be prepared,\ " he said. \"As far as the seriousness of this, I don't think we should underestimate it at all.\ " Understanding public health policies Not all the research is focusing on clinical response to the disease.   Dr. Scott Halperin, a professor of pediatrics, microbiology and immunology at Dalhousie, is leading a team studying COVID-19's impacts on public policy. \"So, looking at public health policy, how it's formulated, and how it intersects with the population and the people who the policy affects,\" he said. This could include looking at restrictive measures like quarantines, which can harm some people financially and socially more than others. The goal, said Halperin, is to come up with ways to improve the formation of public health policy by understanding how communities and individuals affected by it can get involved. Dr. Scott Halperin's research team will use their federal funding to look at policies around COVID-19. (Brooklyn Currie/CBC) Halperin said he's working with a team of more than a dozen faculty members in Canada, Bangladesh, and China. He said the team will look at health-care providers, policy-makers, people who have been recently infected, people who are at risk of infection, and members of the general public in their research. \"Policy is really one of the main ways that we're going to be able to control the infection — either contain it, or if we can't contain it, to mitigate its responses,\ " he said. \"The general public who have to follow these policies need to be confident that these policies are made with their best interests in mind and that their thoughts and concerns are addressed.\ " He said the team will also look at how the media interacts with policy, and how they strike the balance \"between making people aware and making people overly concerned.\" The research team will have a budget of $500,000. Misinformation and social implications A third Dalhousie researcher will study how to address stigmas and misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Jeanna Parsons Leigh, a medical sociologist and assistant professor at Dalhousie's Faculty of Health, is looking to better understand the factors contributing to public knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19. Parsons Leigh could not be reached for comment, but according to a news release from Dalhousie University, this understanding can help develop strategies to combat fear and misinformation.

How sick Canadian travellers are masking COVID-19 symptoms to get through airport screening Canadians desperate to return home from abroad in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are easily circumventing air travel screening aimed at preventing sick and infected passengers from boarding planes, CBC News has found.   Some people are simply hiding symptoms from officials to ensure they can get back home.  In a number of instances, sick travellers have boarded airplanes back to Canada, no matter the risks of spreading infection. \"Now is just the worst time to be coughing, sneezing or reporting any kind of symptom at an airport,\" said one university student in Toronto, who flew home from Spain on March 14. She admitted she purposely hid her symptoms and the fact she'd been suffering a fever hours before boarding the flight. \"It wasn't information you volunteered. So I just stayed quiet about it.\ "  CBC is withholding her name to shield her from backlash, given that she travelled two days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced anyone with symptoms would be barred from boarding return flights. In addition, she was only officially diagnosed with COVID-19 after she got home.   Her case demonstrates just how weak Canada's screening of air travellers is, given it relies solely on voluntary reporting of symptoms.  Even the \"enhanced screening\" adopted in recent days amounts to a simple series of health questions put to air travellers and does not involve any physical detection, testing or thermal screening now being used in many other countries.   Both Air Canada and WestJet said they have barred some passengers from boarding flights, but the situation has air crews and their unions calling for more safeguards to prevent sick travellers from boarding aircraft.  Read more on this story here.

Last week, nearly a million Canadians applied for EI benefits, according to media reports, after they were left jobless when governments across Canada shut down most non-essential businesses in the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Experts say when it comes to the Herculean task of pushing close to one million employment insurance payments out the door in a short period of time, it's more important to get it done fast than it is to get it done perfectly.  Read more on how the government is trying to cope with the surge in EI claims.   In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatoon.  The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan is a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs.  Read more here about one of the few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19.   Doctors from around the world are facing similar issues: lots of patients, long hours and frustration.  And there's concern that it could lead to some serious mental health concerns, even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study of front-line workers involved in the COVID-19 outbreak in China found that those involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with the disease had a higher risk of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress. Dr. Laura Hawryluck, the critical-care response team lead at Toronto Western Hospital, was on the front line during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. She said she saw the toll it took not only on patients in quarantine, but also on those in the medical field. Some, she said, chose to leave the field altogether.  Read more about the pressures health-care workers are facing.   Now for some good news to start your Wednesday:  After blood donations dropped by 40 per cent across the country amid coronavirus fears and warnings to stay home, political and health leaders issued an urgent appeal for people who can donate blood to continue. Blood products have a shelf life. Plasma can be frozen and red cells last 42 days, but platelets — needed by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy — only last seven days. Cydney Kane, a university student in Halifax, saw the plea on her social media feed. \"Just seeing the call go out and knowing that the need is going on and knowing that I could do something to help was more than enough to get me out and book an appointment,\ " she said shortly after giving blood at a Halifax clinic. Thanks to people like Kane, donations have bounced back across the country, and the hope is donors will keep returning.  Read more on this story here. Front Burner: Trump pushes the economy while experts warn of COVID-19 deaths On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he \"would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,\" which is two and a half weeks from now. But many public health experts say the result could be an increase in COVID-19 deaths. Today on Front Burner, CBC senior correspondent Susan Ormiston on the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. — Trump's hopes to see the economy reopened in mere weeks, and what it could mean for a country the World Health Organization warned could become the new epicentre of COVID-19.   Today in history: March 25 1905: Britain and the United States establish the Canada-Alaska boundary. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt told the British government the boundary must be set his way or troops would be sent to enforce it. Canada was left out of the talks and ended up with no seaports in northern B.C. or the Yukon. As a result, Ottawa decided it must handle its own foreign relations and created the External Affairs Department in 1909.   1958:  The first test flight of the Canadian Avro Arrow fighter plane is carried out. But the Arrow program was cancelled by the federal government nearly a year later.   1982:  North America's first test-tube twins, Colin and Gregory Rankin, are born in Oakville, Ont.    1988:  Canada's Kurt Browning becomes the first figure skater to land a quadruple jump in competition.

He was acclaimed to the job, but lost a November election to Lucien Bouchard's Parti Québécois.   2011:  The federal Conservative minority government is brought down on a historic vote in Parliament, forcing an election. MPs voted 156-145 in favour of a Liberal motion citing Stephen Harper's Tories for contempt of Parliament and expressing non-confidence in the government. The contempt citation marked a first for a national government anywhere in the Commonwealth.  
  Only a few panicked days stand between Donald Trump, the self-declared \"wartime president,\" and Donald Trump, the pre-pandemic president who saw concern over the fast-spreading virus as the latest political \"hoax.\ " Critics are certain that the U.S. president's lethargy in the face of one of the most serious public health threats to sweep the globe will cost lives, and his administration is now scrambling to prepare for a war that's already underway.   The coronavirus crisis in the West, however, is still in its opening salvo, and even without Trump's initial indifference, will constitute a severe challenge to his authority and that of most democratic governments — at home and on the world stage. The days following March 11 — when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic — will be remembered for underscoring the extent of that challenge. There was no better illustration of the waning trust in Western leaders, governments and institutions than people's behaviour as the crisis came concretely closer to home: the run on supplies after March 11, the run on rumour and conspiracy theories — and the run on guns in the United States.   And with people themselves seemingly planning for war, no wonder political leaders from the U.S. to the U.K. to France and beyond came to invoke war metaphors, too. No government has been immune But those metaphors are of limited value when the virus is an invisible enemy, and yet one that has managed to strike at the heart of governments around the world. It has sent civil servants home in the hundreds of thousands, suspended parliaments, felled ministers and even infiltrated the lives of leaders themselves — from Spain's deputy prime minister to Canada's prime minister (both of whom went into self-isolation after their wives fell ill) to a U.K. health minister who actually tested positive for the virus.   British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as he speaks during a coronavirus news conference inside 10 Downing Street on March 19, 2020, in London. (Leon Neal/Getty Images) Royalty isn't immune either: Prince Albert of Monaco has tested positive. Even Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip moved residences for Easter a week early as a precaution. At a time when governments are crucially needed — when public health is at high risk and major economies hang in the balance — they are forced to rule remotely, with parliaments only to be exceptionally recalled, if at all.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 21ExclusivePrepare for multiple waves of COVID-19 over 12 months: military chief to troops Further, there is a yet-unchecked impression of an unsettling lack of control that flies in the face of any call for calm: jammed phone lines, jammed airports, empty shelves, stubborn shortages of masks, sanitizer, ventilators (and yes, toilet paper).   French President Emmanuel Macron appears on the front of newspapers with the words 'stay home' on March 17, 2020, in Paris. (Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images) Then there is the necessary but unsettling undoing of the way we live: the suspension of flights, the cancellation of the NBA season and Eurovision, the virtual closure of the U.S.-Canada border, our necessary and for now, indefinite, banishment to our homes.

The coronavirus has exposed the basic lack of resilience.\" Why it's so difficult to get tested for COVID-19 in Canada With a hand tied behind their backs, governments must marshal and deploy their resources, communication ability, legal and fiscal firepower, carefully skirting the line of doing what's best for the population without abusing personal rights or succumbing to the lure of grabbing power.   People watch as German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivers her first direct TV address to the country in a living room in Oberhausen, Germany, on March 18, 2020. (Fabian Strauch/The Associated Press) They must balance their concerns for corporations suffering the ill-effects of a derailed economy with the well-placed worry about those individuals who won't be able to pay the rent. There's also the challenge of actually voting. Just in this week alone, Ohio postponed its primary because of concerns over coronavirus.   There is a lot of handwringing over how all of this will affect the November election in the U.S. What about other elections planned later this year? Blunt language of war It is still early going. But Western leaders are still finding their way around navigating this crisis, and none have really demonstrated the ability to find the words necessary to soothe rattled nerves and contain the crisis of confidence while fighting the coronavirus.   In the days following the declaration of the pandemic, many of those leaders resorted to declarations of war.   Got questions about physical distancing?

In the words of an economic columnist in the Guardian newspaper, Johnson's response thus far is \"laughable,\" and Britain is \"charging into battle armed only with a peashooter.\ "  But by virtue of the task's proportions, it will all begin to feel like a war effort.

The response has been especially rapid as the virus has spread unchecked across the globe. Still, any treatments are a long way from being proven both effective and safe, and most certainly won't come in time to address the current pandemic. According to some of the top infectious disease experts in the world, even on an accelerated timeline, a vaccine is still likely 12 to 18 months away — and then the challenge will be producing enough to make it readily available. There is currently no drug therapy or vaccine approved anywhere in the world for COVID-19. Here are the latest developments in the research. Old drugs, new tricks May 1: Health Canada announces it has authorized the CONCOR-1 clinical study that will involve soliciting donations of blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients across the country to see if their antibodies can help treat people who are sick. April 15: Japan's Fujifilm announces it is ramping up production of Avigan (favipiravir), a drug approved in 2014 to treat influenza that doesn't respond to other drugs. It's produced and distributed at the discretion of the Japanese government and has never been commercially available anywhere in the world. The drug is in Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan, and in other trials in the U.S., Italy and China. April 9: The University of British Columbia announces that patient enrolment is underway for the Canadian arm of the World Health Organization's global SOLIDARITY trial, called CATCO (Canadian Trials for COVID). Patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 at one of 20 participating hospitals in Canada will be eligible for the trial, which will start by evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir, a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, compared with \"optimized supportive care.\" It will later add two other medications for investigation — the antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria. Made-in-Canada quick, portable COVID-19 test kits approved for use April 3: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announces an \"expanded access\" program to facilitate wider study of convalescent plasma  —  that is, injecting the antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered into patients who are sick — as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. The Mayo Clinic is named lead site to co-ordinate the program among dozens of doctors and scientists who initially self-organized to conduct such research. April 2: Canadian Blood Services (CBS) says it is working with researchers to design a large, national clinical trial on treating the novel coronavirus with convalescent plasma.  Pending Health Canada approval, CBS and Héma-Québec will be responsible for supplying the convalescent plasma to hospitals across the country. WATCH |  Dr. Dana Devine explains how 'convalescent plasma' will be collected and used:   \"We think it's most likely to be effective is when you have a patient who is clearly sick with the virus but whose own immune system hasn't had a chance to make antibodies yet,\ " CBS chief scientist Dr. Dana Devine told CBC Radio's Quirks & Quarks.   Convalescent plasma has been used in a small number of COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began, but not in a study comparing those who receive the therapy with those who don't.   March 26: University of Manitoba researchers begin recruiting participants for a series of trials to test whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can reduce the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 and slow its spread. The trial, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta and McGill University Health Centre, will include participants who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who live with someone who has. Long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, but Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said the short, five-day trial should be \"very safe.\"   Manitoba researchers begin clinical trial with drug they hope can help in COVID-19 fight   \"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the health care system.\ " But experts, including Canada's chief public health officer, warn that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side-effects.  They also say there is a danger that hoarding the medication could hurt the many patients who take it for chronic inflammatory diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.   Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19  March 25: New York's Mount Sinai hospital begins treating critically ill COVID-19 patients via plasmapheresis, a century-old therapy that involves removing antibody-rich plasma from blood and returning it to a patient (the same or another) after either treating it or replacing it. In this case, doctors will transfer antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients into sick ones in the hopes the antibodies will neutralize the disease. .<a href=\"https://twitter.com /MountSinaiNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MountSinaiNYC</a> to begin the transfer of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> antibodies into critically ill patients: <a href=\"https://t.co /bpSB2HuSqR\">https://t.co/ bpSB2HuSqR</a > <a href=\"https://t.co /GpEHoHEEM6\">pic.twitter.com/ GpEHoHEEM6</a>&mdash;@IcahnMountSinai March 24 : The Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton announces a study beginning in April to compare therapy using a combination of the antibiotic azithromycin with malaria drug chloroquine versus the usual \"standard of care\" in COVID-19 patients. The trial will involve some 1,500 participants  —  a mix of patients who have been hospitalized for the virus and others in the community who have tested positive for it. March 23: Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute say they are recruiting up to 6,000 Quebecers over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus to study whether colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat gout, Behçet's disease and familial Mediterranean fever, is effective in treating respiratory complications of COVID-19, like lung inflammation, before patients need ventilators or die. Quebecers who meet the criteria and wish to take part in the study at the Montreal Heart Institute can find out more from their doctor or by calling 1-877-536-6837. (Montreal Heart Institute) \"It's inexpensive , it's widely available and the reason why we think it might very well work is that it's a powerful anti-inflammatory agent,\"  Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, the institute's research director, said in an interview with CBC Montreal's Daybreak.   Montreal Heart Institute launches clinical study into colchicine as potential COVID-19 treatment  March 18: The World Health Organization announces the SOLIDARITY trial, a co-ordinated international study into potential treatments for COVID-19 that will test and compare four different drugs or combinations of drugs either developed or already licensed for use to treat other illnesses: remdesivir, an antiviral; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; interferon beta-1a, used to treat multiple sclerosis, with lopinavir and ritonavir; and anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Canada is among the countries participating. March 11: The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic.   March 6: Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, begins two Phase 3 trials of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola: one in patients with \"severe disease\" and another in patients with \"moderate disease.\" The studies will be conducted in the U.S., U.K., Italy, Hong Kong, Spain and a number of other countries.   List of COVID-19 clinical trials authorized by Health Canada  Feb. 21: The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initiates a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir, which is believed to operate by stopping the virus from replicating. Remdesivir is an investigational drug, meaning it's not currently approved anywhere to treat any condition. It was developed to treat Ebola but was ultimately unsuccessful. Participants in this trial will be COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia.   Immunizing the herd April 30: There are eight vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, and 94 in preclinical evaluation. April 21: U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces that a vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University will begin human trials on April 23. He said the British government was providing £20 million to the Oxford team to help fund their clinical trials, and a further £22.5 million to researchers at Imperial College London, who are working on another potential vaccine that they have been testing in animals. The Oxford research team said one million doses of its vaccine candidate were already being manufactured, in hopes it turns out to be effective.

The companies committed to making any vaccine they develop affordable and accessible. China's Ministry of Science and Technology announces CanSino Biologics is beginning the second phase of testing its vaccine candidate, one of only three in the world currently being tested in humans. April 11: There are three \"vaccine candidates\" in clinical evaluation, including Inovio's INO-4800, and 67 more in preclinical evaluation. ' A race against the disease': Canadian researchers part of global effort to develop COVID-19 vaccine April 6: Pennsylvania-based biotechnology firm Inovio Pharmaceuticals administers its first dose of INO-4800, which it developed with funding in part from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It's the second vaccine candidate to begin human trials in the U.S. March 23:  The Canadian government announces $275 million in funding for a number of Canadian research initiatives into vaccine development and testing.  One of them is a Saskatoon lab that for four decades has been working on coronavirus vaccines primarily for animals, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs.

March 16: Scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin a first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine when they administer the first shot to a volunteer patient.  Code-named mRNA-1273, the vaccine candidate was developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. LISTEN | The CBC News podcast Front Burner looks at the pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine With no clear end in sight, the urgent race for a vaccine is on across the world. This week, hopes for a vaccine grew as some biotech players are seemingly making progress. But, some experts caution that this process cannot be rushed - and that we are still far from seeing a vaccine on the market. 13:25
  Medical researchers are working on multiple approaches to experimental vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The federal government announced $2.7 million in funding for vaccine candidates. Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is investing more than $23 million US in the development of new vaccines against COVID-19. France's president has announced a video summit of G7 leaders on Monday to discuss co-ordinating research on vaccines and treatments as well as an economic response to the pandemic. A vaccine would prevent the pandemic from spreading as fast as it is now, said Charu Kaushic, scientific director of Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Infection and Immunity. \"It's just spreading everywhere,\ " she said. \"If we had a vaccine , we could control it.\ " Kaushic said instead of putting all its eggs in one basket, CIHR is funding multiple projects in the hopes that at least one of them will work. 2 elements to a successful vaccine  To work, a vaccine needs to succeed in getting our immune system to produce antibodies in the blood. The antibodies recognize, remember and defend against the virus if you're exposed to it. Kaushic, an immunologist and HIV vaccine researcher at McMaster University, said because COVID-19 is a lung infection, any vaccine needs to protect specifically against the virus getting into the lungs. \"Vaccines can fail because you can get very good antibodies and other things that work great in the blood, but not in the lungs. \"You may not get protective immunity at all.\" An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute in  northern Israel this month, where efforts are underway to produce a vaccine against COVID-19.   (Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty) Viruses, especially new ones, are particularly difficult because they aren't well understood. For SARS-CoV2, the virus at the centre of the pandemic, scientists are still learning about how it is transmitted. Even though multiple researchers are working on the problem, it is rare to get a new vaccine in under a year. A top U.S. health official told a House committee that human trials for a potential vaccine could begin within a few weeks with the goal of going into the arms of the general public within 12 to 18 months. Vaccine in a year?   The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \"I want to make sure people understand, and I've said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\ " NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"We mean it's record time to get it tested. It's going to take a year to a year-and-a-half to really know if it works.\" Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material from the virus in the form of nucleic acid. That tells the human body how to make proteins that mimic viral proteins and this should provoke an immune response. Currently the pandemic coronavirus has infected more than 130,000 people worldwide.  While most people have mild respiratory symptoms, a vaccine would be a safer way to protect people because it would reduce the risk of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Denis Leclerc, an infectious diseases researcher at Laval University in Quebec City, said the advantage of nucleic acid vaccines like Moderna's is that they're much faster to produce than other types. Denis Leclerc and his colleagues at Laval University are hoping to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled in case of future outbreaks.   (Radio-Canada) While relatively safe, nucleic acid vaccines are generally not the preferred strategy, Leclerc said, because they don't have the same safety record as the traditional approach. Leclerc's team has a different approach. They are working with a small part of a protein from the virus that can be synthesized quickly and then attached to a platform to trigger an efficient immune response in humans. \"I was thinking of still using proteins to conserve very high safety and still get speed,\ " Leclerc said. His team has animal data showing this approach might work for coronavirus and for other viruses that emerge in future. Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study revealsAs coronavirus spread speeds up, Montreal researchers will trial an anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 in China Leclerc expects the proof-of-concept experiments for his COVID-19 vaccine will be ready in six months. Even though it's fast to develop, it may come too late for the current pandemic of COVID-19. That's what happened with Canada's Ebola vaccine. The experiments happened years previously, but the vaccine wasn't manufactured in time for the 2014 epidemic that ravaged West Africa. The Ebola vaccine is being used now to control Congo's outbreak. These Quebec professors are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccineFrom test strips to llama antibodies, U of O researchers take on COVID-19 Elsewhere in Quebec City, the biotech firm Medicago is producing another potential COVID-19 vaccine that uses particles that mimic the virus. Researchers will mass produce that vaccine candidate quickly in plants instead of the slower traditional way of using animal cells or eggs. The company is using the same approach to produce seasonal flu vaccines, in an effort under review by Health Canada. 
  Blood-sucking bats may have something to teach humans about self-isolation.   New research suggests vampire bats living in virus-plagued colonies cut back on interactions with sick acquaintances but they continued to care for their closest relatives. \"Interestingly, strong family bonds were less affected by the appearance of this simulated disease than weaker social relationships,\" said Sebastian Stockmaier, a PhD student at the University of Texas and the study's lead author. \"Sick moms kept taking care of their young and healthy moms kept taking care of their sick young, too.   \"Whereas social interactions between unrelated individuals decreased, social interactions between related individuals were maintained.\" Much like humans, bats are social creatures living in large, highly interconnected communities. The nocturnal hunters live in colonies numbering in the hundreds to thousands, sleeping wing to wing on cave walls. When illness strikes, it spreads quickly within the population. While the study was conducted long before the pandemic hit, and didn't involve any strain of coronavirus, Stockmaier can't help drawing parallels between the behaviour of sick bats and the human effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.   \"It's very interesting because it's kind of similar to what we observe with self-isolation or social distancing right now,\" Stockmaier said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.   \"We're often still around close friends or family even if we social distance. And they would still take care of us if we fall ill and we would do the same.\" Highly social blood sippers Stockmaier, working with researchers from Texas and Panama, has been studying a small captive population of bats in Panama. Bats are the perfect case study, he said. They develop bonds that many have compared to human friendships.  Highly concerned with hygiene, bats groom each other, preening family members and unrelated neighbours.   More importantly, bats share food to prevent starvation in the colony. Bats returning from successful hunts regurgitate bites of their blood meals into the mouths of their hungry friends. Their survival strategies are reciprocal and help create a social structure within the colony. Lazy bats who continuously freeload off their friends and beg for meals by licking the mouths of successful hunters are eventually cut off from the free food. Grooming sessions also stop if not returned. The behaviours ensure the survival of the colony but can also make them susceptible to communicable disease.   They're always eating blood and blood is not very nutritional.- Sebastian Stockmaier To study these interactions, Stockmaier and his team at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama baited wild bats with cattle blood and captured them in nets.   The bats were injected with a bacterial extract that stimulated their immune systems and mimicked the symptoms of a virus without actually making them ill. The bats became too lethargic to hunt or clean themselves. \"This immuno-stimulant triggers this very common set of sickness behaviours,\ " Stockmaier said. \"They're triggered by our own immune system and they make you lethargic and make you sleep more, they make you socially disconnected, all these feelings you have when you're sick.\"  To simulate a night of missed hunting and encourage food sharing, some bats were periodically removed from the colony for 24-hour stints and denied food.   Sick bats continued to socialize but their social interactions changed. Grooming time with bats outside the family circle declined, but sick bats begging for a meal would be fed. Familial structures remained intact. Mothers continued to feed their young no matter who was sick.   \"They would groom each other less, but food sharing didn't change and that's presumably because food sharing is a much more important social interaction for them in terms of survival,\" Stockmaier said.   \"They're always eating blood and blood is not very nutritional. And so if they can't get this food shared from others, then they run the risk of starvation.\"     Their bonds are very similar to human friendship.- Sebastian Stockmaier Not all diseases are created equal and further research is needed, Stockmaier said.   But he's hopeful the work can help conservationists better predict how pathogens move through bat populations, and shed light on the spread of disease among some equally social, albeit much larger mammals. \"It's important to focus on these species that have these social structures that have some similarities to ours,\" he said. \"Their bonds are very similar to human friendship. I think that's what makes them so so interesting.\"    How vampire bats survive on an 'extreme' diet of just blood 'Worse' pandemic on horizon unless world deals with wildlife markets
  Albertans who have been exposed to the coronavirus are being asked to join a clinical trial into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-viral drug that's been used for decades to treat malaria and some auto-immune diseases. It's one of the drugs that U.S. President Donald Trump has touted as a \"game changer.\" Albertans who have been exposed to COVID-19 will form one part of the study, while those who have tested positive for the disease are being asked to join a separate trial.   Researchers are hoping to recruit as many as 600 people across the province. \"For now, this is going to be for people living with somebody who's known to be COVID positive or somebody who's a health-care worker that's been looking after someone who's known to be positive,\" said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an associate professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta's faculty of medicine.   The study is being led by McGill University with participants from Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta expected to include as many as 1,500 people from Canada. Another 1,500 people are enrolled in a similar study in the United States.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 8   McGill team seeks Quebecers exposed to COVID-19 for hydroxychloroquine study    At a time of physical distancing, participants will have no contact with medical researchers conducting the study. It means that more Albertans who live outside Calgary and Edmonton and away from the province's major universities will be able to participate. Anyone who's been exposed to the virus is being asked to visit COVID-19research.ca to see if they qualify for the study. If accepted, they'll receive a five-day course of either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo. \"We're going to be giving medication to people after they've been exposed and possibly infected to see if we can prevent that infection from taking hold,\" said Schwartz. \"No medication has proven to be effective in either preventing or treating COVID-19. And that's why we need to do these studies.\ " Evidence lacking  The head of the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious disease at the University of Calgary's Cumming school of medicine says the results from three, small studies into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 have been mixed. Two studies showed positive results, while the third was negative.   Dr. Chris Mody says the three trials involved a total of 120 patients and their outcomes following a six-day course of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Watch | Be wary of online information claiming to 'cure' COVID-19: Misinformation about so-called miracle cures for COVID-19 are spreading online. Can you really buy your way to a better immune system? We ask an expert: UBC professor Bernie Garrett, who studies deception in healthcare, including alternative medicine. 5:27 One of the trials showed virtually no difference between those who took the drug and those who didn't. Another trial showed more people who took HCQ recovered from pneumonia compared with those who received the usual care. The third trial showed more people who didn't take HCQ converted from a positive test for COVID-19 to a negative one.   \"I wouldn't say on the basis of that number of patients and two trials that look positive and one that looks negative, that we should be using hydroxychloroquine as the standard of care,\" said Mody. \"I would describe the evidence for hydroxychloroquine is that it indicates it should be studied further. That's about as far as I would go with the evidence there.\" Controversy, warnings, hoarding HCQ has received a lot of attention since President Trump touted it as a \"game changer\" in a tweet last month. He suggested hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin, an anti-biotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia, would change the world of medicine. Since the March 21 tweet, a number of people have expressed enthusiasm for the still-unproven claims.   Alberta talk radio host Danielle Smith apologized and deleted a tweet that claimed HCQ cured 100 per cent of coronavirus patients within six days of treatment.    Talk radio host deletes tweet with false claim that there's a 100% cure for coronavirus   Kathy Macdonald, a University of Calgary senator, said in a recent tweet that HCQ is \"the most effective drug!\" while retweeting an article that suggested physicians shared the same view.   University of Calgary senator Kathy MacDonald retweeted an apparent survey of physicians who praised an unproven therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The tweet has since been deleted.   (Twitter) The University of Calgary distanced itself from Macdonald's tweet. \"The University of Calgary is committed to developing solutions that are evidence-based and backed by scientific rigour. The views expressed were posted on a personal social media account and do not reflect those of the University of Calgary.  We encourage Albertans to look to Alberta Health Services for guidance on best practices in the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation. In a separate tweet, Macdonald questioned why the Alberta government has such a narrow view on potential remedies. Both tweets have since been deleted. Kathy MacDonald has since deleted a tweet that questioned the Alberta government's 'narrow view of potential remedies' for COVID-19. (Twitter) In a statement to the CBC, Alberta Health said in part: \"While different research projects are underway to assess the effectiveness of various therapies, there is no robust evidence yet on any treatment. We are closely monitoring the emerging evidence across Canada and around the world. If that changes, we will alert Albertans and take action accordingly.\ "  However, the ministry acknowledged that more information regarding research studies will be made available as early as this week. \"We know that many Albertan physicians are interested in enrolling patients in research studies underway on experimental therapies,\ " it said in a statement.  \"We will be sending information out in the coming days so physicians who want their patients to have access to these therapies can put them in touch with the appropriate people.\ " There's also been concern about the supply of HCQ since it's been touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada   The governing bodies for Alberta's physicians and pharmacists issued a joint warning about prescribing behaviours, misuse and stockpiling of the drugs. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and the Alberta College of Pharmacy said there are \"serious concerns about shortages\" that could affect patients with chronic conditions who rely on the drugs.   Schwartz says all of the headlines around HCQ and some of the other drugs is a concern, and that it's important for the research to get underway to safely monitor patients who qualify for the trials. \"We want to avoid people taking this medication until it is proven to be both safe and effective for this purpose,\ " he said. Health Canada says so far eight clinical trials have been approved.   Schwartz says just as fast as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, they're hoping to get preliminary results from their trials in a matter of weeks.    Bryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

  A Winnipeg-based researcher is playing a key role in a national effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. University of Manitoba scientist Dr. Brian Mark is studying the molecular biology of novel coronavirus to find weakness that can be targeted for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines. \"What has to happen now is to reduce the rate of the spread so that the health-care system can cope with the number of infected people,\ " he told CBC's Janet Stewart. Mark, a professor in the university's department of microbiology, is part of one of 47 research teams across the country that received money through several agencies, non-profits and the federal government for studying coronavirus. Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced last week the federal government is spending $27 million on research with the goal of mitigating the outbreak and preventing misinformation. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the global spread of the virus a pandemic. Hours later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1-billion package — including another $275 million for more research such as vaccine development — to help Canadians cope with the outbreak. Trudeau announces $1B COVID-19 package as WHO calls global outbreak a pandemicManitoba plans to purchase $35M worth of masks, sanitizer and other gear to protect against COVID-19 Half a million dollars over two years is going to Mark and his team of two Ontario researchers, lead investigator Dr. Sachdev Sidhu of University of Toronto and Dr. Roman Melnyk of the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Mark's prior work on coronavirus is being applied to target antiviral drug strategies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. He has been trying to uncover what role proteins and enzymes play in disease, and how they can help in antibiotic drug resistance, viral immune evasion and human genetic disorders. Dr. Brian Mark of the University of Manitoba's microbiology department is examining the molecular structure of coronavirus to identify weakness that can be targeted with an antiviral drug or vaccine. (Submitted by University of Manitoba) Mark said the novel coronavirus is about 90 per cent similar to the SARS coronavirus that emerged in 2003 — except it is more infectious and less lethal. \"In fact, coronarviruses are quite well understood as far as how they're comprised and how they replicate, but there's still a significant amount of research that needs to go into developing a strategy to routinely make vaccines against them.\" Both branches of the immune system need to be tapped  — an antibody-based immune response, in which the body produces antibodies to bind onto the surface of the virus and neutralize it, and the cell-mediated response, which trains the immune system to recognize cells that are infected with the virus so they can be destroyed  — he said. Mark said he is not optimistic there will be a vaccine developed to counter this active outbreak. \"It takes time, and activating both branches of the immune system … is particularly challenging, so I would have to say the chances are lower.\" Manitoba government promises 'emergency-ready' 2020 budgetTrump sharply restricts travel between Europe and U.S. for 30 days amid coronavirus pandemic In the meantime, the research team is trying to identify a protein that the virus needs to replicate in hopes of reducing its duplication rate. Others are trying to repurpose existing drugs to treat COVID-19. \"We'll have to wait and see how that pans out,\ " he said. If successful, he said it would likely be reserved for the most vulnerable people who are extremely ill. \"If you start giving it to too many people, the virus can develop resistance quite easily to it.\" Watch what we actually know about the coronavirus: Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness? CBC News medical contributor and family physician Dr. Peter Lin breaks down the facts about what it is, where it came from, how it spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. 5:10 As of early Wednesday, Canada had 101 reported cases of COVID-19. Manitoba has no confirmed cases to date. Mark's advice for riding it out: distance yourself from people, limit travel, and postpone or limit large gatherings. \"If everybody gets infected all at once , then the health-care system will struggle, so it's social distancing and changing behaviour which can help reduce spread.\"
  Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are aiming to develop a vaccine that could help address an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed six people in China.   On Monday, Chinese health officials on the frontline of the outbreak confirmed to state media that human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred and the number of cases has more than tripled, according to the Associated Press. The outbreak is believed to have started in a seafood market in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan, but it has since spread to Beijing and Guangdong. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television that 258 cases had been confirmed in the city, with six deaths. The outbreak has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003. U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airportsChina confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus Now, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) have requested to work with the virus through the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.   \"In house now we're designing strategies of how we can vaccinate for the disease and how we could test such a vaccine,\" said Volker Gerdts, executive director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac. Volker Gerdts, CEO and executive director of VIDO-InterVac on the University of Saskatchewan campus, says the lab is in the early stages of developing a vaccine to treat a strain of coronavirus that is currently spreading throughout China and nearby countries.   (Submitted by Debrah Marshall) Gerdts said researchers at VIDO-InterVac have extensive experience with coronavirus, as the first vaccine for the virus in cattle was developed at the lab, with research around the virus continuing today. However, Gerdts said they're now looking to develop a vaccine specifically for the virus affecting China, which has come to be known as the Wuhan strain. Since the sequence of the virus was just released last week, they're still in the very early stages of research. \"It's really driving innovation, driving technology, but it's not something that can happen overnight,\ " he said. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, screening measures have been implemented at ports of entry in some neighbouring countries for passengers arriving from Wuhan.   \"The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners to gather additional information,\" said the agency on its website.   It's also initiated new screening measures at Canadian airports in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, which will remind residents travelling from Wuhan to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health question will also be added to electronic immigration kiosks. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakScreening measures initiated at Vancouver airport for China coronavirus outbreak Gerdts said right now, the risk to Canadians is low, but noted if you develop flu-like symptoms, after flying to the affected areas, you should contact a public health office. \"There are a number of steps that we'll take from there, but really the chances are very, very low and so there's no reason at the moment to panic.\ "
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV.

The provinces and territories that list information about recovered cases have reported 2,296 cases as resolved or recovered. There have also been two reported COVID-19 related deaths of Canadians abroad — one in Japan and one in Brazil.   Public health officials caution that reported case numbers don't provide a complete picture of the scale of the outbreak as that data doesn't capture people who haven't been tested and cases that are still under investigation. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has urged people nationwide to practise physical distancing and behave as though there is COVID-19 in their community, even if there is no known case.   There is also evidence that asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 are helping to drive the spread of the virus.   Self-assessment: Alberta Health Services has an online self-assessment tool that you can use to determine if you have symptoms of COVID-19.

  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca   Canada hit another grim milestone in the COVID-19 crisis today, with the number of deaths exceeding 3,000. As of early evening, there were 3,133 deaths, and 51,597 cases.   The news came just after Manitoba became the latest province to release details on how it plans to lift COVID-19 restrictions and restart some sectors of the economy, with Premier Brian Pallister saying people will be dealing with a new normal as officials try to prevent a \"COVID comeback.\ "  Pallister said some restrictions will be lifted beginning May 4.  Non-urgent health care, ranging from dentistry and physiotherapy to elective surgery, will be allowed to operate again. Rules around outdoor recreation will also be loosened, though physical distancing will still be important, the premier said.   Some retail businesses — including clothing stores, restaurant patios and hair salons — will also be allowed to reopen.   \"We must remain vigilant, and we must remain committed — we do not want a COVID comeback.\ " In all cases, Pallister said, businesses will need to follow public health guidelines and ensure a safe experience for both staff and customers. WATCH |  Manitoba premier details reopening plans: Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister outlines the province's reopening plan which is set to begin May 4. 1:18 Pallister said health officials may look at the cap on group gatherings, but he cautioned that large-scale events like festivals and concerts aren't likely anytime soon. As for schools, Pallister said Manitoba is in the \"early days\" of the COVID-19 recovery and the presence of a large number of kids in a school makes social distancing a challenge. The province \"isn't entertaining\" the idea of opening schools at this time, he said. The second phase, which would include more personal services and indoor dining rooms, doesn't have a firm date attached, but the province said it would be no sooner than June 1.   Members of the Canadian Armed Forces take part in a training session before deploying to seniors residences Wednesday in Montreal. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Pallister's move came a day after Quebec announced that some businesses in the hard-hit province will be reopening in May, with Premier François Legault saying the challenge is to \"gradually restart the economy without restarting the pandemic.\" Canada has more than 50,000 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases, with more than 3,000 COVID-19-related deaths, according to a CBC News tally based on provincial data, local health information and CBC's reporting.  Quebec accounts for 26,594 of the cases and 1,761 deaths. Legault outlined a plan that would allow some retail, construction and manufacturing operations to resume at some point next month. But the premier emphasized that the reopening of some businesses doesn't mean that people should be congregating in groups or ignoring public health guidelines. He also stressed the importance of continuing to protect the vulnerable, particularly those living in the province's long-term care homes, which have seen devastating and deadly outbreaks.   ANALYSIS | Why Legault feels it's safe to reopen economy, even though Quebec hit hardest MPs meet in House to debate emergency COVID-19 aid for students   At their daily briefing Wednesday, federal health officials stressed that the virus is still spreading, and that people need to keep following the guidelines for lowering the risk, such as physical distancing and hand washing.   Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam also urged workplaces to have \"good plans\" for when they start to reopen and employees return.   WATCH | 'We need to do better,' says Dr. Theresa Tam: Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the COVID-19 virus has pointed out deficiencies in workplaces' health and safety practices. 1:38 Prince Edward Island, which has just 27 cases (with 24 considered recovered) also outlined its initial reopening plan on Tuesday. The small province is taking a phased approach — and like Saskatchewan and Quebec, it has attached specific dates to some early stages.   On May 1, P.E.I. will allow non-urgent health care to resume, a move that covers everything from cancer screenings to optometrist visits. There will also be some loosening of social restrictions, as non-related groups of up to five people will be allowed to visit — provided they are outside and at least two metres apart.   Phase 2, which allows small indoor and slightly larger outdoor gatherings, as well as more business openings, is set for May 22. Phase 3, which allows even larger gatherings and reopens some personal services, recreation facilities and restaurants in a limited way, is set for June 12. There's no date attached to Phase 4, which the province describes as the \"new normal\" for P.E.I. \"We need to be cautious, we need to be careful and we need to be methodical,\" P.E.I. Premier Dennis King said. \"There are no programs to bring people back from the dead.\ "   Alberta is expected to outline its reopening plan later this week, though the precise timing is not yet clear. \"Some of this we're going to have to make final decisions as we get closer to them, based on how well we do,\" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Tuesday.  \"But I do hope that we will be able to begin reopening aspects of social and economic life that have currently been suspended in the month of May.\"   Alberta meat processing plant linked to largest COVID-19 outbreak in Canada to reopen in early May   Ontario's recently revealed plan has a detailed framework outlining what needs to happen before restrictions can be lifted, but Premier Doug Ford has repeatedly described the plan as a roadmap, not a calendar.    ANALYSIS | People are getting COVID-19 by community transmission, but Ontario knows little about how  WHO defends its response The novel coronavirus, which was first reported in China in late 2019, causes an illness called COVID-19.

However, the wearing of masks will be mandatory in shops and on public transport.   Public health officials in India have shelved their plan to administer hydroxychloroquine or HCQ, an untested anti-malarial, to thousands in Mumbai's crowded slums as a way of preventing infections in healthy people.  Health officials in Mumbai said that the plan to \"conduct a test\" was still on the cards but had not yet been approved by the Indian government.     How COVID-19 symptoms develop, and how long they last    The United Nations humanitarian chief says there have been 44 cases of COVID-19 and four deaths in Syria. Mark Lowcock told the UN Security Council that a health-care system decimated by nine years of war can't be expected \"to cope with a crisis that is challenging even the wealthiest nations.\ " He says \"testing capacity remains very limited,\" and measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 are already hurting the most vulnerable. South Korean infectious disease experts have downplayed concerns that patients could get reinfected with the new coronavirus after fully recovering.  While hundreds in South Korea have tested positive again after their release from hospitals, Oh Myoung-don, who heads the country's central clinical committee on new infectious diseases, told a news conference on Wednesday there was a \"high possibility\" that such test results were flawed.

(Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) Sri Lanka will reimpose a 24-hour countrywide curfew as part of the country's stringent measures designed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, effective Thursday night and continuing until May 4. The government's decision to go for a blanket curfew across the island comes after a surge of confirmed cases in the last three days. There are now 630 COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka, including seven deaths.   WATCH | Vaccine development aided by intense global focus, says Toronto respirologist: 'This is an effort like no other we've ever seen,' says Dr. Samir Gupta, who believes that could help shorten the vaccine development cycle.   1:30 
  Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are aiming to develop a vaccine that could help address an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed six people in China.   On Monday, Chinese health officials on the frontline of the outbreak confirmed to state media that human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred and the number of cases has more than tripled, according to the Associated Press. The outbreak is believed to have started in a seafood market in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan, but it has since spread to Beijing and Guangdong. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television that 258 cases had been confirmed in the city, with six deaths. The outbreak has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003. U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airportsChina confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus Now, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) have requested to work with the virus through the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.   \"In house now we're designing strategies of how we can vaccinate for the disease and how we could test such a vaccine,\" said Volker Gerdts, executive director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac. Volker Gerdts, CEO and executive director of VIDO-InterVac on the University of Saskatchewan campus, says the lab is in the early stages of developing a vaccine to treat a strain of coronavirus that is currently spreading throughout China and nearby countries.   (Submitted by Debrah Marshall) Gerdts said researchers at VIDO-InterVac have extensive experience with coronavirus, as the first vaccine for the virus in cattle was developed at the lab, with research around the virus continuing today. However, Gerdts said they're now looking to develop a vaccine specifically for the virus affecting China, which has come to be known as the Wuhan strain. Since the sequence of the virus was just released last week, they're still in the very early stages of research. \"It's really driving innovation, driving technology, but it's not something that can happen overnight,\ " he said. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, screening measures have been implemented at ports of entry in some neighbouring countries for passengers arriving from Wuhan.   \"The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners to gather additional information,\" said the agency on its website.   It's also initiated new screening measures at Canadian airports in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, which will remind residents travelling from Wuhan to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health question will also be added to electronic immigration kiosks. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakScreening measures initiated at Vancouver airport for China coronavirus outbreak Gerdts said right now, the risk to Canadians is low, but noted if you develop flu-like symptoms, after flying to the affected areas, you should contact a public health office. \"There are a number of steps that we'll take from there, but really the chances are very, very low and so there's no reason at the moment to panic.\ "
 Speeding up research into drugs and vaccines for coronavirus is a priority for the World Health Organization's efforts to contain the outbreak centred in China. An advanced team from the United Nations's global public health organization met in Beijing on Wednesday. They're aiming to learn more about the virus itself as well as China's unprecedented response. At a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the development of therapies is an important public health priority, but not the only one. \"We have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus,\ " he said. Current weapons include standard hygiene measures like frequent handwashing. Who's the Canadian leading WHO's coronavirus investigation in China? Doctors and other health-care workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak in China don't have any specific treatments to use against this new virus. When they try to treat severe cases, they're walking a tightrope aiming to find just the right level of immune response to kill the virus without setting off other problems.   China has had more than 1,000 deaths and 40,000 cases of the illness, now called COVID-19. The rest of the world has less than 400 cases with one death confirmed outside China. It will be important to determine which patients need higher levels of care compared with those who are best off isolating themselves at home to limit the number of exposures, said Dr. Jerome Leis. (CBC) The virus causes respiratory symptoms, such as cough and fever. Dr. Jerome Leis and his team treated Canada's first case at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto last month. The man in his 50s initially had some X-ray findings that clinicians were concerned might worsen. \"After they were admitted, they did gradually improve and eventually their symptoms resolved completely,\ " said Leis, referring to the man. \"I think this story highlights, although we have seen poor outcomes related to this infection, including fatalities, those are the exception, not the rule.\" A key difference from flu The man received blood tests and fluids. Doctors were prepared to give oxygen, but he didn't need it. As with his patient, Leis said chest X-rays of the lungs of patients hospitalized in China were usually abnormal. \"The novel coronavirus is a lot like influenza in terms of how it presents,\ " Leis said. \"And yet a key difference is we don't have an antiviral that can really be used … to treat patients, which is useful in limiting the spread of influenza in hospitals. This is definitely an area of very active research.\" Medical staff move a coronavirus patient into the isolation ward in a hospital in Wuhan last week. (Barcroft Media/Getty) For Leis, another critical area for medical researchers to try to determine is which patients will need higher levels of care compared with those who are best off isolating themselves at home to limit the number of exposures. That's particularly important for those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, where health-care workers seem to be hard hit. In a case series published last week on 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, more than a quarter needed to be treated in intensive care and many needed invasive ventilator support. Dr. Preeti Malani is a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan and a journal editor who wrote a JAMA viewpoint offering a snapshot on the outbreak for clinicians. Malani said doctors and scientists are getting data from China about the cases but more context is needed. \"Are those previous diagnoses that are [just] now being confirmed?\" Malani said. \"Same thing with the deaths. Are those people who've recently become ill, or are those people who've been ill for some time?\" CBC IN BEIJING'A whole country locked inside': China struggles with coronavirus, and a new normal Sometimes symptoms, such as cough and fever, can be mild initially and then the more severe pneumonia develops a few days later, she said. You don't want immune response 'to go crazy' Estimated coronavirus death rates of three to four per cent are probably based on the sickest individuals, with the risk of hospitalization and death likely higher for those aged 50 and higher, she said. There is no specific treatment or vaccine approved for use in the outbreak. For now, doctors in China use a trial-and-error process, reserving existing antiviral medications and other treatments such as corticosteroids for the sickest patients. Canadian infectious disease specialist Dr. John Conly says scientists don't yet understand the virus's transmission. 8:55 \"The tendency is to say, 'Well, let's give it a try,'\ " Malani said. \"Among people who get better, it's hard to say how much of that was from the antiviral versus just people's own bodies.\" Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, didn't work to fight two other coronavirus infections, SARS and MERS, and WHO doesn't recommend it for COVID-19. Matthew Miller, who studies viruses and immune responses to viruses at McMaster University, called corticosteroids a blunt sledgehammer often used to treat inflammation. A patient surnamed Jia, centre, who was cured of pneumonia from the new coronavirus infection, walks out of the ward with medical staff in Zouping City in China's Shandong province.   (Costfoto/Barcroft Media/Getty) Normally, when someone is infected with a respiratory virus, the patient's immune system kicks in to fight off and kill the virus. But data from early cases in China suggest that the culprit in people who were severely sickened in the coronavirus outbreak is often an overactive immune response.   \"You need your immune response to still be functional because you want your immune response to kill the virus,\ " Miller said. \"You just don't want it going crazy.\ " When there's a massive immune response, the patient can suffer more damage than healing, and problems such as breathing difficulties can be exacerbated. Similar overactive immune responses were reported during the H1N1 flu pandemic.   In a tight balancing act, some of the experimental antivirals target inflammatory proteins that help get rid of excess inflammation can lead to severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulty, he said. Second Opinion'We're opening everything': Scientists share coronavirus data in unprecedented way to contain, treat diseaseTreating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon In China, scientists are researching and developing a potential vaccine, as well as looking at a specific immunoglobulin or blood product to use in critically ill patients and screening antiviral drugs. Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs against the new coronavirus, and preliminary clinical trial results are weeks away, Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a former WHO virologist who co-chaired the meeting, said on Wednesday. Kieny said a number of patients have already been dosed with a combination of the antiviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir. The combination is available in generic form to treat HIV.   Attending day 2 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com /WHO?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a> ’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> < a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavairus?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavairus</a > meeting on research priorities.

He recovered, but it's not known if the antiviral helped him.    \"We will have to wait for a few weeks whether this [remdesivir] gives any positive signal,\" in Chinese research, Kieny said. 
  A million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by British scientists are already being manufactured and will be available by September, even before trials prove whether the shot is effective, the team said on Friday. The Oxford University team's experimental product, called \"ChAdOx1 nCoV-19,\" is a type known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine, and is one of at least 70 potential COVID-19 candidate shots under development by biotech and research teams around the world. At least five of those are in preliminary testing in people. The Oxford scientists said Friday they were recruiting volunteers for early stage — Phase 1 — human trials of their shot, and large-scale production capacity was being put in place \"at risk.\ " This means the shots will be produced in large numbers at risk of being useless if trials show they do not work. \"We have started at risk manufacturing of this vaccine not just on a smallish scale ... but with a network of manufacturers in as many as seven different places around the world,\" Adrian Hill, a professor and director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, told reporters in an online briefing. Oxford University professor Adrian Hill said his team plans to have 'at least a million doses' of the vaccine ready by September. (Eddie Keogh/Reuters) \"The aim is to have at least a million doses by around about September, when we also hope to have efficacy [trial] results.\ " He said three of the manufacturing partners were in Britain, two in Europe, one in India and one in China. The scientists said initial manufacturing costs would be in the \"tens of millions\" of pounds and acknowledged the investment risk of pressing ahead with production before verification. They did not give details of their financing. Vaccine trials to begin within weeks By 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, more than 2.18 million people had been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally, according to a Johns Hopkins tally. There have been nearly 150,000 deaths. Hill's team said it plans to start safety and then mid-stage efficacy trials of the potential COVID-19 vaccine in adults aged between 18 and 55 within weeks. They then plan to expand the trial group to older ages later, and hope to run a final phase trial with around 5,000 volunteers in the late summer. 117 million children risk missing measles vaccines due to COVID-19 pandemic'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Hill and his co-researchers acknowledged that many other research teams worldwide were also working on potential vaccines, with only a proportion likely to be fully successful. Asked when the shot — if proven to work — might be able to be made widely available to the public, Hill said the best-case scenario would be for regulators to grant it \"emergency use  approval.\ " That could be achieved within six weeks beyond the point at which data shows whether it is effective. That, he said, could mean around six weeks from September, when the team hopes to have positive trial data.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on April 17
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a massive $82-billion aid package to help Canadians and businesses cope with the global COVID-19 pandemic, including income supports, wage subsidies and tax deferrals. The package includes $27 billion in direct supports and another $55 billion to help business liquidity through tax deferrals. Combined, the package represents more than three per cent of Canada's GDP.  Trudeau said the deep spending and delayed federal revenue will not drive the country into recession, insisting \"prudent\" decisions made over the last five years have put Canada on a strong economic footing to weather the crisis. \"We will be able to make sure our economy gets back up to speed very quickly,\" he said. Parliament could be recalled as early as next week to pass legislation to bring in the fiscal measures. The supports aim to help Canadians pay for rent and groceries, to help businesses continue to meet payroll and pay bills, and to stabilize the economy. Supports could start flowing in weeks, Trudeau said. \"No matter who you are or what you do , this is a time where you should be focused on your health, and that of your neighbours, not whether you're going to lose your job, not whether you're going to run out of money for things like groceries and medication,\ " he said. The emergency aid plan includes:   A temporary boost to Canada Child Benefit payments, delivering about $2 billion in extra support. A new Emergency Care Benefit of up to $900 biweekly, up to 15 weeks, to provide income support to workers, including the self-employed, who have to stay home and don't qualify for paid sick leave or employment insurance. The measure could disburse up to $10 billion. A new Emergency Support Benefit to provide up to $5 billion in support to workers who are not eligible for EI and who are facing unemployment.    A six-month, interest-free reprieve on student loan payments. Doubling the homeless care program.   Extending the tax filing deadline to June 1. Allowing taxpayers to defer until after Aug. 31 tax payments that are due after today and before September. $305 million for a new Indigenous Community Support Fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation communities.   Other measures include a GST credit for low-income Canadians and special support for the homeless and shelters helping people escaping gender-based violence. Trudeau said there is a \"real\" desire among opposition political parties to help Canadians, and he is confident that the measures can pass quickly in Parliament. House leaders from all parties held a conference call today.  Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez said his counterparts from the other parties expressed a desire to work collaboratively and in a responsible way to pass legislation to help Canadians as quickly as possible. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the economy will recover PM Justin Trudeau announced a $82 billion aid package to help individuals and businesses during the COVID-19 crisis and assured Canadians the economy will recover quickly.   1:06 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party will cooperate with the government because it supports measures that put money directly into the hands of Canadians. He said Conservatives would press the government to make sure that nobody who needs support falls through the cracks.   \"We believe that in this time frame, when people are going through hardship in real time, that Parliament must react very quickly,\ " Scheer told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos. However, Scheer criticized the finance minister for running budget deficits in previous years, which he said limits the government's fiscal capacity during an economic downturn. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said he's encouraged by some of the Liberal proposals, but is concerned about the length of time it will take for people to access the funds. \"There's people that we know right now are not able to work, don't have the ability to earn any income, and have bills to pay,\" said Singh. \"People need help right away.\ " Singh said New Democrats are willing to fast-track any legislation that will ensure money flows to people who need it most. Watch: Scheer reacts to the federal government's COVID-19 economic aid package Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says the federal government has reduced capacity to act during the COVID-19 pandemic because of previous budget deficits. 1:36 Virus will 'be around for a while' The number of confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada has risen above 700, with nine deaths — seven in B.C, one in Ontario and one in Quebec. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said today the country has seen a \"sharp rise\" in the number of cases and that indicates community spread. She said Canadians should not invite others into their homes at this time and should work from home wherever possible. Tam also warned that the virus will be around for a while and will not be eradicated from the world within months. People need to prepare for another \"wave\" that could come after an initial containment period, she said. \"You're going to have to prepare as though this virus is going to have more than one wave. I think that's the only prudent thing to do,\" she said. Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, P.E.I., Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon and the Northwest Territories have all declared either a state of emergency or public health emergencies in order to unlock resources and government powers to ensure access to critical supplies. Late Wednesday, Saskatchewan also declared a state of emergency. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam says there are now 598 cases in Canada and eight related deaths. She says indicates a \"sharp rise\" in the number of cases and indicates community spread. 2:15 Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the impact of the pandemic is \"profound\" but assured Canadians the government will do \"whatever it takes\" to help them through the crisis. He described today's package as the \"first phase\" of planned measures. \"Usually, my job is to ensure we maintain our fiscal track, but right now as minister of finance, my only job is to make sure that Canadians can keep food in the fridge, that they can keep a roof over their heads, that they can afford the medicine that they need,\ " he said. \"We've entered this challenge in a very strong fiscal position. Canada's balance sheet is the envy of the world and it means we have the fiscal firepower to respond. We're now prepared to use it.\ " Finance Minister Bill Morneau outlines the details of the government's $82B financial aid package, aimed at helping Canadians and businesses during the COVID-19 crisis.   20:48 More information about applying for EI sickness benefits is available on the government's website. Applications for the new benefits will open in April and will require Canadians to attest that they meet the eligibility requirements, and to re-attest every two weeks. When the new benefits are available, Canadians can apply through the CRA My Account secure portal, through a My Service Canada Account or by calling a toll-free number the government plans to introduce, which will be equipped with an automated application process. The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global economy, sending stock prices diving and forcing businesses to shut their doors as governments institute lockdowns and other social distancing measures to slow its spread. Today, Canada and the United States reached an unprecedented deal to close their shared border to non-essential travel, as both countries try to restrict the spread of the coronavirus. Canada, U.S. border temporarily closing to non-essential traffic to slow COVID-19Ottawa announces $10 billion business credit line, plans to roll out stimulus package as COVID-19 spreads Trudeau announced Monday the government was closing Canada's border to all travellers except for Canadian citizens, permanent residents and Americans, with exceptions for flight crew members, diplomats and some immediate family members of Canadians. Canadian businesses of all sizes are feeling the pain from shutdowns, cancellations and public fear as the number of confirmed cases rises each day. Trudeau said Tuesday that Parliament could be recalled to pass emergency economic measures. Minister of Finance Bill Morneau says the government will do \"whatever it takes\" to respond to the global pandemic. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) The government is also considering invoking the Emergencies Act, which would grant it extraordinary powers to restrict movement and regulate and distribute critical supplies during the pandemic. Today, Trudeau said invoking the act would be a \"significant step, not one that we feel we need today, but not one that we are closing the door to in the future, if necessary.\ " Government set to announce $25B aid package to help Canadians through COVID-19 crisis Today's announcement is in addition to a $1 billion COVID-19 response package and supports for business already announced by the government. Last week, Trudeau pledged $1 billion for increased public health measures. The package includes $275 million for additional research, such as vaccine development, and $200 million for federal medical supplies, supports for Indigenous communities and education efforts.   Another $500 million is going to support provincial and territorial governments. The federal government has also waived the one-week waiting period for employment insurance claims related to COVID-19. Morneau also announced last Friday the establishment of a $10 billion credit fund to lend money to businesses to help them continue operations.   (CBC) 
  A University of Saskatchewan research team and scientists from across the country have been awarded $1 million over two years to develop animal models and test vaccine candidates to find a vaccine for COVID-19. The project is being led by the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac), and is part of a rapid research funding initiative, designed to contribute to efforts to contain COVID-19.   PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccineSask. researchers aiming to develop a vaccine for coronavirus outbreak in China Volker Gerdts, director of VIDO-InterVac, said a race is underway to find the best animal for replicating the disease.   \"Is it mice, hamsters, or ferrets? Whichever model works best is the one we're going to use,\ " he said in a statement provided by the university.   \"Once the model is developed, we will then be able to test our vaccine candidates for effectiveness.\"   He said the virus is already being grown in VIDO-InterVac labs and the process of developing an animal model is already underway. The lab has already infected some ferrets with COVID-19. The lab's vaccine is also already being generated; Gerdts said with the money in hand, the lab can now begin testing the vaccine on animals and study the safety of the vaccine. He said once the vaccine has passed safety tests on animals, it will need to be studied in humans. Researchers also hope to better understand issues like transmission between animals, impact of age on disease and susceptibility of agricultural animals like chickens or pigs.   \"The goal is to develop a disease in these animals that is similar to humans, so that we then can use that as a read-out to show that our vaccine works, or it doesn't,\ " Gerdts told CBC News. The 12-member team is led by Darryl Falzarano. He said the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine that provides protection against multiple coronaviruses. 
  Good morning! This is our daily news roundup with everything you need to know in one concise read. Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every morning. Will it really take 'weeks' to ease physical distancing? Maybe not With increasing evidence that Canada is flattening its COVID-19 curve, the next challenge is when and how to begin easing the country's physical distancing rules. Take it slow and steady, say some experts, who note that it might be possible to start the easing sooner than you think.   There might well have been collective discouragement when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday that our isolation must continue for \"weeks.\"  But will it really take that long? It's a debate that is just beginning, with some pushing for faster easing and others — especially those on the front lines in hospitals — begging for more time. Watch |  How to physical distance in tricky situations    \"I believe we're at the peak but not through the peak,\ " said Dr. MIchael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and veteran of the SARS epidemic and H1N1 influenza pandemic. He has been bracing for the COVID-19 surge for months as chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in Toronto. \"I thought it would be much worse. I was thinking about battlefield triage and who would get ventilators.\"   Gardam is not expecting Canada to face the nightmare scenarios of New York City and northern Italy,  \"as long as we keep being intelligent and keeping a lid on things.\"  Opening up health care depends on a steady supply of protective equipment.  So far, Dr. Matthew Muller, the medical director of infection prevention and control at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, is not confident that support is in place. \"We've already depleted a lot of our supplies that have not been replenished yet, so there's a number of pieces to the puzzle,\ " he said.   As CBC's Kelly Crowe writes, the bottom line is that physical distancing was never intended to prevent people from catching COVID-19.  The goal was to keep everybody from getting sick at once.   \"We want the epidemic to simmer, not to boil.  The cases are going to happen, but if they happen at a simmer, we'll be able to handle them,\" said Gardam, noting that discussions of how to begin easing up have already started.  Read more on this story here. Checking on family   (Christinne Muschi/Reuters) Pierre Boule and his brother Sylvain look in a window to see their 96-year-old mother, Georgette Larame, yesterday at Centre d'hebergement Yvon-Brunet, a seniors' long-term care centre, in Montreal. In brief Oversight of infection control measures — key to keeping long-term care homes free of illness — plummeted when Ontario scaled back comprehensive annual inspections last year, a CBC News investigation has found. Infection control violations would typically be caught during so-called resident quality inspections (RQIs), but CBC News found that the number of violations dropped off along with the number of inspections in 2019.  Read more about the drop in infection control oversight here. Watch |  Comprehensive long-term care inspections found critical shortcomings before they were cancelled  With most shelters full and operating at a lowered capacity to adhere to physical distancing rules, some cities, such as Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto, are putting up the homeless in hotels.  But advocates say there are too few beds and not enough being done.  The executive director for the Native Women's Shelter in Montreal says she's frustrated that the homeless are being left out in the cold — figuratively and literally — during this pandemic.  Read more about advocates urging governments to provide more shelters and amenities for the homeless amid the pandemic.    At least 50 per cent more people died in China's virus epicentre of Wuhan than previously counted, with state media on Friday attributing the initial undercount to how overwhelmed the health system was coping with thousands of sick patients. The addition of 1,290 victims raised Wuhan's death toll to 3,869, the most in China, and may confirm suspicions that far more people died in the city where the illness began than has been previously announced.  Read more on the revised death toll in Wuhan here.   Fans around the world — and now two members of the U.S. Congress — are demanding Live Nation, the world's largest entertainment company, refund tickets for all events cancelled or postponed by the COVID-19 crisis.  The company, which owns Ticketmaster and took in $11 billion US in concert and ticket revenue last year, is under pressure from customers to return their money immediately. The company announced this week that while it honours refunds for shows that have been officially cancelled, 90 per cent of its shows are simply being postponed for future dates that have yet to be set. That means it won't reimburse most of its customers right now as it awaits an end to the pandemic in the hope of one day rescheduling events.  Read how the pandemic has left Live Nation scrambling for cash.   Just days after saying he had total authority to reopen states, U.S. President Donald Trump yesterday sounded more deferential as he released a set of guidelines and said governors could \"call their own shots.\"  But with legal authority and public support already on their side, Trump's reversal changes little. Before Trump's pivot, states were already well ahead in the discussion of what comes next. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said he would begin slowly reopening on May 1, when current shutdown orders expire. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on the other hand, extended his state's stay-at-home orders until May 15.  Read more about the reopening debate in the United States.   Watch |  Some states extend COVID-19 restrictions, Trump reveals reopening plan   One of the world's foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators.  \"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation. The technique was first met with ridicule before being widely adopted.  Read more about Gattinoni's concerns here.   Now for some good news to start your Friday:  Worried she would expose her family to the deadly COVID-19 virus, London, Ont. , nurse Barbie Allen was in need of a solution. Someone suggested she rent an RV to park in her driveway so she'd have a place to sleep near her family, but not so close as to risk infection. That's where brothers Andy and Kirk Thomson, who own Can-Am RV Centre, came into the picture. Allen called Kirk about renting an RV. Two days later, he was backing one into her driveway. There was only one problem: he wouldn't take payment at all. \"He said 'Oh no, this is the least I could do.'\ " Andy said his family felt compelled to help after seeing stories about front-line health-care workers treating COVID-19 patients while putting themselves, and their families, at risk of infection.

Front Burner: Could COVID-19 survivor blood keep people safe? As scientists worldwide scramble for COVID-19 treatments and cures, some see promise in antibody-rich plasma of survivors. In Canada and beyond, survivors are donating their blood for new, fast-tracked clinical trials.  Today, CBC senior correspondent Susan Ormiston joins us from Washington, D.C., to explain why antibody-rich plasma could be useful in the fight against the coronavirus.   Today in history: April 17 1610: Explorer Henry Hudson sails from England. Two months later, he reached what is now the Hudson Strait in the Canadian Arctic.   1855:  The city of Charlottetown is incorporated. In September 1864, it played host to the Charlottetown Conference on Atlantic Union, which turned into the discussions that led to Confederation.   1961:  About 1,500 Cuban exiles, trained by the CIA, launched the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in a failed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government.   1967 : Prime Minister Lester Pearson announces the creation of the Order of Canada, a decoration to honour outstanding citizens.   1982: Years of political wrangling end when Queen Elizabeth signs the royal proclamation of Canada's Constitution in a Parliament Hill ceremony.    1998 : Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce announce plans to merge. The decision came nearly three months after a similar announcement by the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal. The federal government rejected both mergers at the end of the year. 
  Scientists around the world are racing to find novel ways to treat, mitigate or prevent infection from the novel coronavirus. The response has been especially rapid as the virus has spread unchecked across the globe. Still, any treatments are a long way from being proven both effective and safe, and most certainly won't come in time to address the current pandemic. According to some of the top infectious disease experts in the world, even on an accelerated timeline, a vaccine is still likely 12 to 18 months away — and then the challenge will be producing enough to make it readily available. There is currently no drug therapy or vaccine approved anywhere in the world for COVID-19. Here are the latest developments in the research. Old drugs, new tricks May 1: Health Canada announces it has authorized the CONCOR-1 clinical study that will involve soliciting donations of blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients across the country to see if their antibodies can help treat people who are sick. April 15: Japan's Fujifilm announces it is ramping up production of Avigan (favipiravir), a drug approved in 2014 to treat influenza that doesn't respond to other drugs. It's produced and distributed at the discretion of the Japanese government and has never been commercially available anywhere in the world. The drug is in Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan, and in other trials in the U.S., Italy and China. April 9: The University of British Columbia announces that patient enrolment is underway for the Canadian arm of the World Health Organization's global SOLIDARITY trial, called CATCO (Canadian Trials for COVID). Patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 at one of 20 participating hospitals in Canada will be eligible for the trial, which will start by evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir, a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, compared with \"optimized supportive care.\" It will later add two other medications for investigation — the antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria. Made-in-Canada quick, portable COVID-19 test kits approved for use April 3: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announces an \"expanded access\" program to facilitate wider study of convalescent plasma  —  that is, injecting the antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered into patients who are sick — as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. The Mayo Clinic is named lead site to co-ordinate the program among dozens of doctors and scientists who initially self-organized to conduct such research. April 2: Canadian Blood Services (CBS) says it is working with researchers to design a large, national clinical trial on treating the novel coronavirus with convalescent plasma.  Pending Health Canada approval, CBS and Héma-Québec will be responsible for supplying the convalescent plasma to hospitals across the country. WATCH |  Dr. Dana Devine explains how 'convalescent plasma' will be collected and used:   \"We think it's most likely to be effective is when you have a patient who is clearly sick with the virus but whose own immune system hasn't had a chance to make antibodies yet,\ " CBS chief scientist Dr. Dana Devine told CBC Radio's Quirks & Quarks.   Convalescent plasma has been used in a small number of COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began, but not in a study comparing those who receive the therapy with those who don't.   March 26: University of Manitoba researchers begin recruiting participants for a series of trials to test whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can reduce the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 and slow its spread. The trial, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta and McGill University Health Centre, will include participants who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who live with someone who has. Long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, but Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said the short, five-day trial should be \"very safe.\"   Manitoba researchers begin clinical trial with drug they hope can help in COVID-19 fight   \"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the health care system.\ " But experts, including Canada's chief public health officer, warn that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side-effects.  They also say there is a danger that hoarding the medication could hurt the many patients who take it for chronic inflammatory diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.   Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19  March 25: New York's Mount Sinai hospital begins treating critically ill COVID-19 patients via plasmapheresis, a century-old therapy that involves removing antibody-rich plasma from blood and returning it to a patient (the same or another) after either treating it or replacing it. In this case, doctors will transfer antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients into sick ones in the hopes the antibodies will neutralize the disease. .<a href=\"https://twitter.com /MountSinaiNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MountSinaiNYC</a> to begin the transfer of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> antibodies into critically ill patients: <a href=\"https://t.co /bpSB2HuSqR\">https://t.co/ bpSB2HuSqR</a > <a href=\"https://t.co /GpEHoHEEM6\">pic.twitter.com/ GpEHoHEEM6</a>&mdash;@IcahnMountSinai March 24 : The Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton announces a study beginning in April to compare therapy using a combination of the antibiotic azithromycin with malaria drug chloroquine versus the usual \"standard of care\" in COVID-19 patients. The trial will involve some 1,500 participants  —  a mix of patients who have been hospitalized for the virus and others in the community who have tested positive for it. March 23: Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute say they are recruiting up to 6,000 Quebecers over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus to study whether colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat gout, Behçet's disease and familial Mediterranean fever, is effective in treating respiratory complications of COVID-19, like lung inflammation, before patients need ventilators or die. Quebecers who meet the criteria and wish to take part in the study at the Montreal Heart Institute can find out more from their doctor or by calling 1-877-536-6837. (Montreal Heart Institute) \"It's inexpensive , it's widely available and the reason why we think it might very well work is that it's a powerful anti-inflammatory agent,\"  Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, the institute's research director, said in an interview with CBC Montreal's Daybreak.   Montreal Heart Institute launches clinical study into colchicine as potential COVID-19 treatment  March 18: The World Health Organization announces the SOLIDARITY trial, a co-ordinated international study into potential treatments for COVID-19 that will test and compare four different drugs or combinations of drugs either developed or already licensed for use to treat other illnesses: remdesivir, an antiviral; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; interferon beta-1a, used to treat multiple sclerosis, with lopinavir and ritonavir; and anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Canada is among the countries participating. March 11: The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic.   March 6: Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, begins two Phase 3 trials of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola: one in patients with \"severe disease\" and another in patients with \"moderate disease.\" The studies will be conducted in the U.S., U.K., Italy, Hong Kong, Spain and a number of other countries.   List of COVID-19 clinical trials authorized by Health Canada  Feb. 21: The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initiates a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir, which is believed to operate by stopping the virus from replicating. Remdesivir is an investigational drug, meaning it's not currently approved anywhere to treat any condition. It was developed to treat Ebola but was ultimately unsuccessful. Participants in this trial will be COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia.   Immunizing the herd April 30: There are eight vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, and 94 in preclinical evaluation. April 21: U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces that a vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University will begin human trials on April 23. He said the British government was providing £20 million to the Oxford team to help fund their clinical trials, and a further £22.5 million to researchers at Imperial College London, who are working on another potential vaccine that they have been testing in animals. The Oxford research team said one million doses of its vaccine candidate were already being manufactured, in hopes it turns out to be effective.

LISTEN | The CBC News podcast Front Burner looks at the pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine With no clear end in sight, the urgent race for a vaccine is on across the world. This week, hopes for a vaccine grew as some biotech players are seemingly making progress. But, some experts caution that this process cannot be rushed - and that we are still far from seeing a vaccine on the market. 13:25
  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca   The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan to marshal Canada's scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government's strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials and expanding national testing and modelling.   $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.   In mid-March, the Trudeau government committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan's reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided the number of cases there stays low.   Premier Scott Moe said restrictions will be lifted May 4 for dentists' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers. Golf courses will reopen May 15 and retail shops selling clothing, books, flowers and sporting goods might be allowed to open their doors on May 19.

(Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.   For the next phases  — for which there are no start dates yet —  officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government's plan doesn't provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. ' Not exactly islands'   Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. \"Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,\ " he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. \"We are going to have to make sure we're on the same page with this.\" ' Failing our parents, our grandparents': Trudeau Trudeau said the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. \"If you're angry, frustrated, scared, you're right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders.\" WATCH | Should long-term care homes be federally regulated? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Thursday. 1:12 The comments today followed requests by Ontario and Quebec on Wednesday for hundreds of soldiers to help long-term care facilities that have been hit hard by COVID-19. The Canadian Armed Forces is now assessing what more it can provide to respond to these requests. Trudeau said the government is sending the military to help in long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec  — 130 troops were sent to help five long-term care facilities in Quebec last week  — but said it should never have come to this, and there are tough questions to be asked once the crisis is over.

The report cited draft documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization. In a statement on Friday, Gilead said the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study and that the study was terminated early due to low enrolment and, as a result, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions. Here's what's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 7:30 p.m. ET European Union leaders edged forward on Thursday toward joint financing of an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by agreeing to ask the European Commission to work out the details of such common support.

(Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images) Still, a decision is likely months away as member countries disagree on how much financial aid should be given out.   Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands all opposed recovery aid through grants, while a broader northern camp — including Germany — were in favour of linking a new Recovery Fund to the bloc's next long-term budget for 2021-27, sources said.    EU holds critical virtual summit on setting yearslong budget in a time of pandemic   Hard-hit Italy called for a Recovery Fund of 1.5 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion Cdn) as well as grants to member states, while French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe's response required financial transfers to the hardest-hit states, and not just loans. Macron also said the European project had no future if member states failed to respond to the \"exceptional shock.\"     The World Health Organization said it would announce a \"landmark collaboration\" on Friday to speed development of safe, effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19. The Geneva-based agency, in a brief statement issued late on Thursday, said the initiative with partners aims to make technologies against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus \"accessible to everyone who needs them, worldwide,\" but gave no details. With more than 22,000 officially recorded deaths, officials in Spain are now preparing for rolling back some of the strict lockdown restrictions. The confinement has helped slow the daily contagion rate increase from more than 20 per cent to less than two per cent, although Spain has not been testing widely and the real contagion is believed to be higher.

China also said on Thursday it would donate a further $30 million US to the World Health Organization, about a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that U.S. funding would be halted while Washington reviewed the WHO's role \"in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\"  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to return to work as early as Monday after being hospitalized earlier this month with COVID-19, the Telegraph reported, even as the U.K. economy is crumbling under the strain of the coronavirus lockdown.

(Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images) North Korea has told the World Health Organization it tested 740 people for the new coronavirus as of April 17 but that all came out negative.  That claim is being questioned by many outside experts. South Korea's health authorities are planning to soon begin antibody tests to learn how widespread the coronavirus infection is within the population. They are also researching how long people maintain immunity after recovering from COVID-19.   South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government will allow a partial reopening of the economy on May 1, with travel restrictions eased and some industries allowed to operate under a five-level risk system. International borders will remain closed while travel will be only allowed for essential services. COVID-19 cases surged 43 per cent in the past week across Africa, reaching 26,000 according to the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in the continent and push 30 million into desperate poverty.   Ecuador's health minister said on Thursday the country's coronavirus case total was twice as high as previously confirmed, as authorities added 11,000 new infections that resulted from delayed testing. With 560 confirmed deaths, the outbreak has ravaged the economy of the oil-producing country and overwhelmed sanitary authorities in the largest city of Guayaquil, where corpses remained in homes or for hours on the streets. 
  The federal government is committing an additional $20 million in funding for research into the COVID-19 outbreak after previously pledging nearly $7 million in February; several B.C.-based researchers are among those receiving grants.   Researchers from the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, the University of the Fraser Valley, and Royal Roads University had projects selected to receive the two-year grants, which can amount to $1 million for medical countermeasures, and $500,000 for social and policy countermeasures.   \"I think this whole collection of researchers makes for a vibrant community and a lot of knowledge sharing,\" said Dr. Srinivas Murthy, a UBC associate professor in pediatrics, who is leading a project in search of a treatment. Murthy is organizing randomized clinical trials in Canada for patients infected with COVID-19 to see which medication works best to combat the disease.    Flight attendants wear masks while travelling through Vancouver International Airport on Jan. 28. (Ben Nelms/CBC) \"The first drug we're testing is a medication that we use for HIV, which is the virus that causes AIDS so it's a medication that we've had for 20 years now and it's been proven very safe, and a bunch of people have thought that it would be effective against coronavirus,\" said Murthy. \"It works on it in a lab setting, but we don't know if it works in a real life patient setting, and so what we're hoping to do is run a study to see if it does work in that real life setting.\" Murthy says regulatory approvals for their clinical trials are happening right now, and they hope to operate in 30 to 40 hospitals across Canada. Social scientists examine other aspects But it's not just laboratory doctors who will receive federal funding in the global response against COVID-19. Social scientists and researchers will be looking at completely different aspects of the outbreak. Cindy Jardine, a Canada Research Chair in health and community at University of the Fraser Valley, and Yue Quian, an associate professor of sociology at UBC are two researchers who received funding for their projects.   Quian's project will look at how people and communities react to and cope mentally with quarantine by studying a group of people affected by the quarantine in the city of Wuhan, China, which has effectively been shut down since Jan. 23.   The shutdown of the city — which has a population of 11 million and is considered the epicentre of COVID-19 — is thought to be the largest quarantine in human history.   The research has a personal resonance for Quian. She was born and raised in Wuhan, and her father is living alone in the city under quarantine.    \"I try to contact him very regularly to provide some virtual company to him,\" she said. \"[But] the people in Wuhan now ... they seem to have developed some daily routine to cope with these quarantine lifestyle.\" Jardine's project will look at the role of travel in the transmission of COVID-19, specifically people travelling back to their countries of origin, and potentially what kind of communication is necessary to adequately confer risk.   B.C. ramps up coronavirus response, activates provincial pandemic co-ordination plan \"We're focusing on how people ... decide to act on information and that's very much determined by the cultural lens in which they view information and decide what's important to them or not,\ " Jardine said.    Quian says projects like these provide important context to the headlines. \"A lot of times when we think about these contagious disease epidemics, we think about how many people died, how many new confirmed cases we have, but as the WHO has pointed out, we need to remember those are people not numbers,\ " she said.

  The latest:   Alberta has 49 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province's total to 195 cases. Two confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the University of Calgary have been linked to an event involving more than 50 doctors. Some Alberta daycares will reopen next week for kids of health-care and 'critical' staff, Premier Jason Kenney announced Friday. Alberta homeless shelters, like the Mustard Seed and Drop-In Centre, will receive a financial boost from the province to help implement social distancing measures. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi is encouraging anyone who sees an individual or business that is violating orders under the local state of emergency to report it to 311.   Grade 12 diploma exams have been cancelled, but students can request an exam if there are special circumstances.   The Alberta government said it would provide front-line medical staff and funding to help shelter the homeless during the pandemic.   Alberta's first COVID-19 death was announced Thursday afternoon. As of Thursday, there have been 146 confirmed cases in the province. The province's credit rating has been downgraded in light of a budget that is \"no longer valid\" as the price of oil continues to batter the bottom line. Truckers continue to deliver goods across the province, but are facing stress and reduced services. A doctor in Edmonton who tested positive for the virus was seeing patients prior to diagnosis, but that wasn't revealed to the public. The City of Calgary will delay its 2020 census and set up a new fund to help maintain essential social services. Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson declared a state of local emergency on Friday.   What you need to know today in Alberta: The curve of new cases continues to rise in the province and it's not expected to peak until mid-April. If that's the case, measures to halt the spread will likely be in place until May. The province is urging everyone to take the outbreak seriously and practise social distancing.

  The World Health Organization has issued a blunt assessment of the coronavirus outbreak in Saudi Arabia, acknowledging for the first time that there are concerns the virus may be spreading from person to person, at least in a limited way. The statement called for urgent investigations to find the source of the virus and how it is infecting people. And it reminded countries they have a duty to the international community to rapidly report cases and related information to the WHO. Saudi Arabia has reported its 41st case of the coronavirus. (Beth Fischer/Canadian Press) The worrying appraisal of the situation was echoed in a revised risk assessment issued Friday by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). It warned hospitals in Europe to be on the lookout for coronavirus cases coming in by air ambulance, saying the numbers of such patients may rise if the public in affected countries are afraid to seek care in their own hospitals. The warnings come as health leaders from around the world are gathering in Geneva for the World Health Assembly, the annual general meeting of the WHO. The eight-day meeting begins Monday. Though other nations have not publicly pressed leaders of coronavirus-affected countries for more transparency to date, it is likely that concerns about the virus and the opaque way investigations into it are being handled will be aired during the meeting. \"There is no formal agenda for novel coronavirus but I would be surprised if it didn't come up,\ " WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in an interview. Saudi Arabia, after all, is the home of Mecca. The holy site draws roughly three million Muslims from around the world every year to the Hajj, a mass pilgrimage Muslims are meant to perform at least once in their lifetimes. As well, nearly one million international tourists travel to Mecca during Ramadan — the Muslim month of fasting — to take part in another pilgrimage called Umrah. Potential spread during Ramadan Ramadan starts in the second week of July this year. And the 2013 Hajj will take place in mid-October, only five months from now. Experts watching the coronavirus situation are already worried about the potential for spread of the new virus, both within Saudi Arabia and internationally. \"I don't think anyone necessarily knows for certain what is or isn't happening,\" said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious diseases specialist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. In his research, Khan tracks global travel patterns as a tool to predict and interpret spread of diseases.   Learn how the WHO is tracking this new virus   \"I'm not sure that there's an easy way to get at this information unless it's more forthcoming from within Saudi Arabia or any of the partners that are working with Saudi Arabia inside the country.\ " To date, the WHO has been notified of 40 confirmed infections with the virus, which has been recently named MERS, for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Of those cases, 20 have been fatal. The bulk of the infections have occurred in Saudi Arabia, which is investigating a large and potentially ongoing outbreak in the eastern part of the country, near the Persian Gulf.   WHO statement Human-to-human transmission of nCoV has now been documented in several clusters of cases, including among family members and in health care facilities.   All confirmed cases have had respiratory disease and most have had pneumonia. Half of all confirmed cases have died. So far, there has been no evidence of sustained transmission beyond the immediate clusters. All cases have had some link to the Middle East, although local transmission from recent travelers has been observed in France and the United Kingdom.   In its statement, the WHO said two of the cases in that outbreak have no links to either other coronavirus patients or a hospital where some transmission is known to have occurred. These unconnected cases suggest two possibilities. They could have contracted the virus from its as-yet unidentified reservoir, which is thought to be one or more animal species. Or these cases could be a signal that undetected human transmission is happening there. \"The continued appearance of cases that are not part of larger clusters, and who do not have a history of animal contact, increases concerns about possible community transmission. This possibility is being investigated by authorities in Saudi Arabia,\" the WHO statement revealed. Other countries that have reported cases are Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Britain and France. But the infections in the European countries all had their origins in the countries on the Arabian Peninsula. The statements from the WHO and the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)  both underscored how little the world has learned about the new virus since its existence was first publicly announced last September. \"It is unusual to have such a degree of uncertainty at this stage in an outbreak,\" the European health agency's statement noted. It called the information that has been shared about the cases, including the current Saudi outbreak, \"insufficient.\"  How the 10th anniversary of the SARS outbreak was marked   Illustrating the problem, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health changed the count on its coronavirus website Friday, adding another case — which brings the global total to 41. The ministry revealed only that an infected person had been found in the eastern region and was receiving care. The ECDC statement also said at this point it cannot exclude the possibility that the virus is acting in a SARS-like manner, especially given that outbreaks in hospitals have now occurred in several instances. ' This is not being handled' Hospitals played a key amplifying role during the 2003 SARS outbreak, with undetected cases infecting other patients, visitors and health-care workers. The MERS virus is from the same family as the SARS virus. The criticisms and concerns embedded in the two statements might appear mild but in the world of public health diplomacy, they are unusually frank.   One expert called the WHO statement a shot across the bow for the countries that have been the sources of MERS infections. \"When you see those words you realize that this is not being handled,\" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"The WHO statement and the ECDC both — they're really important statements.\ " But even at that, Osterholm fears the time for carefully worded warnings may be running out. \"You've got to kind of call the code,\ " he said. \"Either there is going to be an intensive effort made to understand what's going on in the Middle East and appropriate control measures brought to bear or potentially we're going to be asking a lot of questions one day as to why we didn't do more.\ " Neither the WHO nor the ECDC is currently calling for the type of travel advisory the WHO levied on Toronto during the SARS outbreak. At the height of SARS, the WHO urged world travellers to stay away from afflicted areas, including Toronto. But the ECDC said European travellers to the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries should be informed of the infection risk. And companies that operate medical evacuations should be reminded of their responsibility to try to prevent transmission of infections across borders. It suggested that mapping the medical evacuation routes from that region would help to identify which centres in Europe might be at greatest risk of receiving unidentified coronavirus cases. 
  The world we'll live in — post-pandemic. What will change when the COVID-19 pandemic ends? Will our world return to its old ways, or emerge retooled, revised, or perhaps even changed for the better? In this second instalment of a series looking at life after the coronavirus pandemic, CBC Manitoba looks at the historic treatment of vaccines, vaccine research and the science behind it — and whether lessons learned from COVID-19 will be heeded into the future.   A team of researchers has been given the green light — and money — to help science our way out of another pandemic. That's the good news. But history has revealed that the world has a short memory, and once the worst of the bad is over, interest in a preventative vaccine tends to die down, scientists say. That's the bad news.   Only time will tell whether lessons learned from this COVID-19 pandemic will sink in a little longer, but at least one researcher isn't optimistic. \"Maybe in the short term? I'm not sure about the long term,\" said research scientist Darryl Falzarano, laughing as he answered.   \"Sorry. I guess you caught me on a pessimistic day.\" 'There'll still be anti-vaxxers' Falzarano knows his coronaviruses. It's his job.   The former Manitoban (a graduate from both the University of Winnipeg and University of Manitoba) is now with the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, or VIDO-InterVac, at the University of Saskatchewan.   For years, he and his colleagues have done animal research on the potential for vaccines against coronaviruses that came along prior to COVID-19, like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For years, they've envisioned completing the next phase of this — a vaccine-manufacturing facility to support further vaccine research and, eventually, clinical trials on humans. Then came COVID-19. And now comes the money for VIDO-InterVac. How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine In March, the federal government committed $23 million to the academic research lab. Some of it — $11 million — was money already in the works prior to the outbreak, Falzarano says. The other $12 million is in direct response to the pandemic, and will go toward completing the vaccine-manufacturing facility, he says. And that, in return, will get them one step closer to beginning small, first-phase clinical vaccine trials on humans. \"It's been a work in progress for years,\ " Falzarano said. \"This will allow us to move things quicker.\" 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds upScience summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe Still, Falzarano knows there are some who'd just as soon they take their time. \"I'm sure there'll still be anti-vaxxers,\" he said, laughing again. He's right. Already, some in the anti-vaccination movement are pushing back against COVID-19. Some even allege the illness is a viral version of smoke and mirrors, created in a lab by those who want to score more money by creating a vaccine that pharmaceutical companies will pay for, but that no one really needs. Health policy professor Bruce Y. Lee says history has long predicted the world is not prepared for pandemics like COVID-19. ' None of what's happening is a surprise,' he says. (Submitted by Bruce Y. Lee) \"A lot of anti-vaxx efforts have an agenda behind them,\" said Bruce Y. Lee, a Forbes Magazine health reporter and professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. \"And those agendas don't stop during a pandemic.\ " This is despite the fact that COVID-19 should be the pandemic eye-opener that's long been predicted, Lee says.    If the world heals itself without COVID vaccination, then vaccine skepticism will likely increase.- Gregory Mason In a 2017 article he wrote for Forbes, Yee noted that Microsoft founder Bill Gates, citing leading scientists, cautioned of a pending pandemic that the world was not prepared for.   In 2009, Lee himself, with other leading scientists, had come to a similar conclusion while researching global responses to the H1N1 pandemic.   \"None of what's happening [with COVID-19] is a surprise,\" said Lee. \"And the fact that there's still pushback is not surprising either.\ " Which is why, Lee says, while he's happy to hear about Canada's new financial commitment to Falzarano and his colleagues, he's guarded in his enthusiasm. \"I think we need to be cautious about this. We've seen this repeat situation in an emergency, but then funding dried up.\" Lessons from the past University of Manitoba health economist Gregory Mason doesn't like the odds.   Mason uses risk analysis to understand the motivations of people who are anti-vaccination (or the \"vaccine hesitancy\" movement, \"as I politely call them,\" he says). The basic concept of risk analysis is simple — assess the probable impact of an action taken (or not), and act accordingly the next time around. \"Part of me wants to believe that COVID-19 is scaring the pants off everyone,\" he said. \"But [even] some family members are anti-vaxxers and I see their attitude to the present virus. I am less hopeful.\" 'If we see no repeat cycle ... this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly' after the coronavirus pandemic, says the University of Manitoba's Gregory Mason. (Warren Kay/CBC) History could be a lesson to us.  And it's tried, Mason says — but those lessons have been lost on us. Think back to SARS. In 2003, scientists came close to developing a SARS vaccine to test on humans.   It never made it to trial. As memories of the virus faded, so did public pressure, Mason says, \"because that pandemic just seemed to die out.\" Or think ebola. In 1999, scientists at Canada's then-new National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg began probing the deadly virus, and soon they realized they could develop a vaccine. But it took close to two decades before interest — and funds — led to a vaccine.   And that only happened after a 2014 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.   We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event.'- Bruce Y. Lee And even when a vaccine is created, there's backlash. If a virus is out of sight, it's out of mind.   Take the 2017 measles outbreak. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported a 31 per cent rise in worldwide measles cases that year, estimating 110,000 deaths due to the disease. The reason? A decrease in voluntary vaccinations. The reason for the decrease? The perception that no one gets the measles anymore. ' Immunity can wear off over time': Doctors highlight undervaccination in adultsMarketplaceNearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why. That's why, Mason says, he's doubtful about lessons learned from COVID-19. It might be a better teacher, but its students might soon forget the lesson; especially if the anticipated \"second wave\" of the virus wanes, he says. \"If we see no repeat cycle in the late fall, this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly,\ " Mason said. \"In fact, if the world heals itself without COVID vaccination, then vaccine skepticism will likely increase.\ " What's more, others say, history may not be done with us. \"We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event,'\" Lee says. \"The question is not 'if' but 'when' another pandemic occurs.\" And he poses an even more worrying question. \"Is this pandemic a warning for an even bigger one?\" However, VIDO-InterVac's Falzarano, and his colleagues across the country, are determined to be part of the global effort to prevent that. \"I would hope that [this pandemic] leads people to see that vaccinations are important,\ " he said. \"If we'd had a vaccine ready to go … you could see how impactful that would be.\"  Read more from this series: Post-pandemic, advocates hope to see 'new appreciation,' support for gig workers

We've seen this repeat situation in an emergency, but then funding dried up.\" Lessons from the past University of Manitoba health economist Gregory Mason doesn't like the odds.   Mason uses risk analysis to understand the motivations of people who are anti-vaccination (or the \"vaccine hesitancy\" movement, \"as I politely call them,\" he says). The basic concept of risk analysis is simple — assess the probable impact of an action taken (or not), and act accordingly the next time around. \"Part of me wants to believe that COVID-19 is scaring the pants off everyone,\" he said. \"But [even] some family members are anti-vaxxers and I see their attitude to the present virus. I am less hopeful.\" 'If we see no repeat cycle ... this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly' after the coronavirus pandemic, says the University of Manitoba's Gregory Mason. (Warren Kay/CBC) History could be a lesson to us.  And it's tried, Mason says — but those lessons have been lost on us. Think back to SARS. In 2003, scientists came close to developing a SARS vaccine to test on humans.   It never made it to trial. As memories of the virus faded, so did public pressure, Mason says, \"because that pandemic just seemed to die out.\" Or think ebola. In 1999, scientists at Canada's then-new National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg began probing the deadly virus, and soon they realized they could develop a vaccine. But it took close to two decades before interest — and funds — led to a vaccine.   And that only happened after a 2014 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.   We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event.'- Bruce Y. Lee And even when a vaccine is created, there's backlash. If a virus is out of sight, it's out of mind.   Take the 2017 measles outbreak. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported a 31 per cent rise in worldwide measles cases that year, estimating 110,000 deaths due to the disease. The reason? A decrease in voluntary vaccinations. The reason for the decrease? The perception that no one gets the measles anymore. ' Immunity can wear off over time': Doctors highlight undervaccination in adultsMarketplaceNearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why. That's why, Mason says, he's doubtful about lessons learned from COVID-19. It might be a better teacher, but its students might soon forget the lesson; especially if the anticipated \"second wave\" of the virus wanes, he says. \"If we see no repeat cycle in the late fall, this will all pass as a bad dream, and life will resume quickly,\ " Mason said. \"In fact, if the world heals itself without COVID vaccination, then vaccine skepticism will likely increase.\ " What's more, others say, history may not be done with us. \"We can't sit here and say 'this is a once in a generation event,'\" Lee says. \"The question is not 'if' but 'when' another pandemic occurs.\" And he poses an even more worrying question. \"Is this pandemic a warning for an even bigger one?\" However, VIDO-InterVac's Falzarano, and his colleagues across the country, are determined to be part of the global effort to prevent that. \"I would hope that [this pandemic] leads people to see that vaccinations are important,\ " he said. \"If we'd had a vaccine ready to go … you could see how impactful that would be.\"  Read more from this series: Post-pandemic, advocates hope to see 'new appreciation,' support for gig workers
  A Winnipeg-based researcher is playing a key role in a national effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. University of Manitoba scientist Dr. Brian Mark is studying the molecular biology of novel coronavirus to find weakness that can be targeted for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines. \"What has to happen now is to reduce the rate of the spread so that the health-care system can cope with the number of infected people,\ " he told CBC's Janet Stewart. Mark, a professor in the university's department of microbiology, is part of one of 47 research teams across the country that received money through several agencies, non-profits and the federal government for studying coronavirus. Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced last week the federal government is spending $27 million on research with the goal of mitigating the outbreak and preventing misinformation. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the global spread of the virus a pandemic. Hours later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1-billion package — including another $275 million for more research such as vaccine development — to help Canadians cope with the outbreak. Trudeau announces $1B COVID-19 package as WHO calls global outbreak a pandemicManitoba plans to purchase $35M worth of masks, sanitizer and other gear to protect against COVID-19 Half a million dollars over two years is going to Mark and his team of two Ontario researchers, lead investigator Dr. Sachdev Sidhu of University of Toronto and Dr. Roman Melnyk of the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Mark's prior work on coronavirus is being applied to target antiviral drug strategies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. He has been trying to uncover what role proteins and enzymes play in disease, and how they can help in antibiotic drug resistance, viral immune evasion and human genetic disorders. Dr. Brian Mark of the University of Manitoba's microbiology department is examining the molecular structure of coronavirus to identify weakness that can be targeted with an antiviral drug or vaccine. (Submitted by University of Manitoba) Mark said the novel coronavirus is about 90 per cent similar to the SARS coronavirus that emerged in 2003 — except it is more infectious and less lethal. \"In fact, coronarviruses are quite well understood as far as how they're comprised and how they replicate, but there's still a significant amount of research that needs to go into developing a strategy to routinely make vaccines against them.\" Both branches of the immune system need to be tapped  — an antibody-based immune response, in which the body produces antibodies to bind onto the surface of the virus and neutralize it, and the cell-mediated response, which trains the immune system to recognize cells that are infected with the virus so they can be destroyed  — he said. Mark said he is not optimistic there will be a vaccine developed to counter this active outbreak. \"It takes time, and activating both branches of the immune system … is particularly challenging, so I would have to say the chances are lower.\" Manitoba government promises 'emergency-ready' 2020 budgetTrump sharply restricts travel between Europe and U.S. for 30 days amid coronavirus pandemic In the meantime, the research team is trying to identify a protein that the virus needs to replicate in hopes of reducing its duplication rate. Others are trying to repurpose existing drugs to treat COVID-19. \"We'll have to wait and see how that pans out,\ " he said. If successful, he said it would likely be reserved for the most vulnerable people who are extremely ill. \"If you start giving it to too many people, the virus can develop resistance quite easily to it.\" Watch what we actually know about the coronavirus: Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness? CBC News medical contributor and family physician Dr. Peter Lin breaks down the facts about what it is, where it came from, how it spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. 5:10 As of early Wednesday, Canada had 101 reported cases of COVID-19. Manitoba has no confirmed cases to date. Mark's advice for riding it out: distance yourself from people, limit travel, and postpone or limit large gatherings. \"If everybody gets infected all at once , then the health-care system will struggle, so it's social distancing and changing behaviour which can help reduce spread.\"
  Alberta researchers are hopeful that an antiviral drug engineered to treat the deadly Ebola virus will prove a viable treatment in the ongoing fight against the coronavirus. The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies began enrolling patients in early March. Gilead Sciences — an American biotechnology company with a production facility in Edmonton — developed the drug in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed that several other treatments were more effective against Ebola and remdesivir was discontinued as a treatment. However, testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. ' A very potent compound' The first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States received remdesivir for compassionate use, which allows the use of an unapproved drug to treat a seriously-ill patient when no other treatments are available. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit and received the drug on the seventh day of illness. The next day the patient showed a marked improvement and his symptoms eventually disappeared altogether. If proven effective, remdesivir would be one of the few available remedies for a respiratory illness which has killed thousands of people around the world.   Anecdotal evidence and promising results in animals trials make the drug a strong candidate for clinical trials, said Matthias Götte, chair of the medical microbiology and immunology department at the University of Alberta. Götte has been working with his team to find out how the drug may be used to treat coronaviruses. An attack from the inside His study, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in late February, was among the first in Canada to examine the COVID-19 strain, and explore why remdesivir might be an effective treatment. \"We know the drug works against different coronaviruses, like MERS and SARS, and we know the novel coronavirus is very similar to SARS,\" Götte said. \"The pre-clinical data looked very good. It was a very potent compound so we were interested in the actual mechanism, how that drug actually works against Ebola. \"We created a synthetic version of this enzyme and, in a test tube, we were able to study the mechanism of remdesivir against this Ebola target.\ "   Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world Wednesday   Götte's research shows that the drug stops the virus from replicating. It disrupts the viruses biochemistry by masquerading as a part of the virus itself.    \"Remdesivir essentially mimics one of the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis necessary for genome replication of the virus,\ " Götte said. \"Enzymes within the virus are synthesizing the viral RNA genome with these building blocks, but they mix up the bits they need with the drug. Once the drug is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the virus can no longer replicate.\"   Last week, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will begin this month in countries across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers.   This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.- Matthias Gotte. Götte said no matter the results of the studies, his team will continue to examine how the drug interacts with the new virus. The results of the clinical trial will be only the first step in finding an effective treatment, and one drug will likely not be enough.    \"Ideally, we will have a couple of drugs because certain strains could be resistant to certain treatments,\ " Götte said. He will be anxiously awaiting the results of the ongoing clinical trials which could be available as early as May. \"One thing is clear. This is not a cure,\ " Götte said. \"We have to wait for the clinical trial results. That's the gold standard and we have to be patient.\ "     \"This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.\"  Overwhelming demand     Meanwhile, Gilead, overwhelmed by demand for the experimental treatment, abruptly shut down its emergency access program this week.   The company said it was setting up a broader access program that could try to help more sick people but its current program is unprepared to handle the current health crisis.    \"We recognize that there are severely ill patients who are unable to enrol in clinical trials and for whom no approved treatment options are effective,\ " reads a statement from the company. \"Gilead has been working with regulatory agencies to provide remdesivir to these patients where feasible.\"  Treating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon   To date, the company said it has provided emergency access to remdesivir for several hundred patients in the United States, Europe and Japan. Health Canada had also been considering special access requests for the drug on a patient-by-patient basis. \"In recent weeks, there has been an exponential increase in compassionate-use requests for emergency access to remdesivir, related to the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States,\" reads the statement from Gilead. \"This has flooded an emergency-treatment-access system that was set up for very limited access to investigational medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic.\"  'A fundamental shift': Nearly half of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada now from community spread
  Albertans who have been exposed to the coronavirus are being asked to join a clinical trial into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-viral drug that's been used for decades to treat malaria and some auto-immune diseases. It's one of the drugs that U.S. President Donald Trump has touted as a \"game changer.\" Albertans who have been exposed to COVID-19 will form one part of the study, while those who have tested positive for the disease are being asked to join a separate trial.   Researchers are hoping to recruit as many as 600 people across the province. \"For now, this is going to be for people living with somebody who's known to be COVID positive or somebody who's a health-care worker that's been looking after someone who's known to be positive,\" said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an associate professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta's faculty of medicine.   The study is being led by McGill University with participants from Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta expected to include as many as 1,500 people from Canada. Another 1,500 people are enrolled in a similar study in the United States.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 8   McGill team seeks Quebecers exposed to COVID-19 for hydroxychloroquine study    At a time of physical distancing, participants will have no contact with medical researchers conducting the study. It means that more Albertans who live outside Calgary and Edmonton and away from the province's major universities will be able to participate. Anyone who's been exposed to the virus is being asked to visit COVID-19research.ca to see if they qualify for the study. If accepted, they'll receive a five-day course of either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo. \"We're going to be giving medication to people after they've been exposed and possibly infected to see if we can prevent that infection from taking hold,\" said Schwartz. \"No medication has proven to be effective in either preventing or treating COVID-19. And that's why we need to do these studies.\ " Evidence lacking  The head of the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious disease at the University of Calgary's Cumming school of medicine says the results from three, small studies into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 have been mixed. Two studies showed positive results, while the third was negative.   Dr. Chris Mody says the three trials involved a total of 120 patients and their outcomes following a six-day course of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).

Can you really buy your way to a better immune system? We ask an expert: UBC professor Bernie Garrett, who studies deception in healthcare, including alternative medicine. 5:27 One of the trials showed virtually no difference between those who took the drug and those who didn't. Another trial showed more people who took HCQ recovered from pneumonia compared with those who received the usual care. The third trial showed more people who didn't take HCQ converted from a positive test for COVID-19 to a negative one.   \"I wouldn't say on the basis of that number of patients and two trials that look positive and one that looks negative, that we should be using hydroxychloroquine as the standard of care,\" said Mody. \"I would describe the evidence for hydroxychloroquine is that it indicates it should be studied further. That's about as far as I would go with the evidence there.\" Controversy, warnings, hoarding HCQ has received a lot of attention since President Trump touted it as a \"game changer\" in a tweet last month. He suggested hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin, an anti-biotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia, would change the world of medicine. Since the March 21 tweet, a number of people have expressed enthusiasm for the still-unproven claims.   Alberta talk radio host Danielle Smith apologized and deleted a tweet that claimed HCQ cured 100 per cent of coronavirus patients within six days of treatment.    Talk radio host deletes tweet with false claim that there's a 100% cure for coronavirus   Kathy Macdonald, a University of Calgary senator, said in a recent tweet that HCQ is \"the most effective drug!\" while retweeting an article that suggested physicians shared the same view.   University of Calgary senator Kathy MacDonald retweeted an apparent survey of physicians who praised an unproven therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The tweet has since been deleted.   (Twitter) The University of Calgary distanced itself from Macdonald's tweet. \"The University of Calgary is committed to developing solutions that are evidence-based and backed by scientific rigour. The views expressed were posted on a personal social media account and do not reflect those of the University of Calgary.  We encourage Albertans to look to Alberta Health Services for guidance on best practices in the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation. In a separate tweet, Macdonald questioned why the Alberta government has such a narrow view on potential remedies. Both tweets have since been deleted. Kathy MacDonald has since deleted a tweet that questioned the Alberta government's 'narrow view of potential remedies' for COVID-19. (Twitter) In a statement to the CBC, Alberta Health said in part: \"While different research projects are underway to assess the effectiveness of various therapies, there is no robust evidence yet on any treatment. We are closely monitoring the emerging evidence across Canada and around the world. If that changes, we will alert Albertans and take action accordingly.\ "  However, the ministry acknowledged that more information regarding research studies will be made available as early as this week. \"We know that many Albertan physicians are interested in enrolling patients in research studies underway on experimental therapies,\ " it said in a statement.  \"We will be sending information out in the coming days so physicians who want their patients to have access to these therapies can put them in touch with the appropriate people.\ " There's also been concern about the supply of HCQ since it's been touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada   The governing bodies for Alberta's physicians and pharmacists issued a joint warning about prescribing behaviours, misuse and stockpiling of the drugs. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and the Alberta College of Pharmacy said there are \"serious concerns about shortages\" that could affect patients with chronic conditions who rely on the drugs.   Schwartz says all of the headlines around HCQ and some of the other drugs is a concern, and that it's important for the research to get underway to safely monitor patients who qualify for the trials. \"We want to avoid people taking this medication until it is proven to be both safe and effective for this purpose,\ " he said.

  Younger Canadians represent one in three of all reported COVID-19 cases, and experts say they could be unknowingly accelerating the spread of the virus in Canada and around the world. Of the 4,186 COVID-19 cases for which the Public Health Agency of Canada has provided epidemiological data, 29 per cent are aged 20 to 39 and four per cent are under 19 — meaning one-third of cases in Canada involve people who are younger than 40. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Sunday that those under 40 made up about 12 per cent of hospitalized cases.   \"This statistic is important because it shows that younger age groups are also experiencing illness severe enough to require hospitalization,\ " Tam tweeted.   Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a global health law professor at York University, said that while the rates of hospitalization and death for younger Canadians are lower than older age groups, they're not insignificant. \"It's not even close to zero,\" he said. \"Twelve per cent is still a significant number that should make any younger person stop and pause to recognize that this represents a threat not only to elder members of our society, but to everyone.\"   Hoffman said communicating the risks of dangerous activities to young people who think they're \"invincible\" is always a challenge, but the damage in ignoring containment measures like physical distancing and self-isolation can have devastating effects. \"It's just amplified during a pandemic because usually it's young people who, in ignoring understanding of risk, are endangering themselves and themselves alone,\ " he said.   \"In this context, young people's actions also can put other people at risk, especially the more older people that they come in contact with.\ "  All age groups at risk of COVID-19 Dr. Raywat Deonandan, a global health epidemiologist and an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, said it's important for younger people to remember  we've never encountered this new coronavirus, so we've built up no immunity to it. \"Everybody is susceptible,\" he said. \"Everybody.\ "  A man wearing a mask to protect against COVID-19 is seen in downtown Toronto on March 26, 2020. Canadians under 40 make up about 12 per cent of COVID-19 cases in hospital.   (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Deonandan said a misconception that older age groups are solely susceptible to serious complications from COVID-19 came from early data on China's cases, which showed elderly people — particularly those who smoked — were more likely to have bad outcomes. \"But by the time it made it to Europe, it was shifting dramatically,\" Deonandan said. \"In Europe, we're seeing people being hospitalized a lot in their 30s, 40s and 50s and dying in that age group as well.\ "  Young people have no 'bulletproof' protection from COVID-19 — particularly smokers and vapers Deonandan said one of the key underlying vulnerabilities that puts every age group at risk is respiratory impairment, especially in people with conditions such as obesity, diabetes and asthma. \"That's almost everyone,\ " he said. \"I know people in their 20s and 30s who are a little overweight, who smoke, who vape, who enjoy inhaling marijuana — all of these things compromise your lung function sufficiently to make you vulnerable.\"   What role do children play in the spread of COVID-19?   Hoffman said that while youth under 19 only make up about four per cent of COVID-19 cases in Canada, they may be catalysts for spreading infection more widely because they interact with more people on a daily basis than the general population. \"There is a reason why school closures are one of the first things that happen in a pandemic,\ " he said. \"Schools are a place where social networks collide.\"  Hoffman said students from different social circles come into close contact with peers and teachers daily, meaning that if a virus were to spread in a school it would quickly jump to many different groups. What happens if a case of coronavirus emerges at a  Canadian school? \"Young people actually play a disproportionate role in infectious disease spread,\" he said. \"And the expectation is that that trend would continue for COVID-19.\" Hoffman said teenagers and young adults may also be driving the spread of the virus to older age groups in places like Italy, which has been hit particularly hard in the pandemic, with more than 100,000 cases and 12,000 deaths. \"Of course, in Italy, the big story has been about the elderly because it's the second-oldest country in the world after Japan and we've seen that toll in Italian hospitals,\ " he said. \"But another part of that story is how has it spread so quickly? And there's been a lot of discussion and hypotheses about the role that young people have played in actually transmitting it even though they themselves haven't been as severely affected.\ "  Dr. Alyson Kelvin says research shows children may pose a significant risk in the spread of COVID-19 to older age groups. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press) One peer-reviewed study released early in the journal Pediatrics this month looked at 731 confirmed cases and 1,412 suspected cases of COVID-19 among children aged two to 13 in China. Researchers concluded that 50.9 per cent of the children had mild symptoms, 38.8 per cent had moderate symptoms and 4.4 per cent were completely asymptomatic. Second Opinion'They were completely unaware': Why mass COVID-19 testing is key to stopping spread Another smaller study published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases retroactively tested 36 children in the same households of confirmed adult COVID-19 cases in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang. Researchers found that more than half of the cases were mild — seven had respiratory symptoms while 10 showed no symptoms at all.   \"The data suggests that because children aren't developing as severe disease, they could be the facilitators of transmission,\" said Dr. Alyson Kelvin, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \"So  bringing it into their homes and infecting their parents where their parents are more susceptible to getting sick.\"  Older Canadians are at significant risk of serious cases of COVID-19, but younger age groups may be putting them at more risk unknowingly.   (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Kelvin, who is also a member of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology and part of a research team for a clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine, wrote about the significant risk children play in spreading the virus in a commentary on the study.   \"They actually have a higher percentage of being asymptomatic. We don't know if they have it, so parents should stop sharing food with the kids,\ " she said, \"and make sure there are no quarantine playdates.\" 'Need to scale up testing'   Even though some children in the study were asymptomatic, Kelvin said one important finding was that they still presented evidence of pneumonia in their lungs —  something she thinks is particularly significant for parents.   \"If you had a child that had maybe some health issues, they could be more susceptible to hospitalization because their friends might not show that they're infected,\ " she said.  \"But interaction might lead to something more severe in certain children.\" Hoffman said that because young people are more likely to show milder symptoms of COVID-19, they're likely not going to hospital, being tested or being added to the daily confirmed cases in Canada and around the world. Second OpinionHow deadly is COVID-19? Why it's different in every country \"We need to scale up testing of whether someone has this virus,\ " he said, \"but also whether someone had the virus and whether they've developed immunity.\"  Hoffman said serological testing — blood testing that can detect if someone has been infected and detect antibodies  — is the next key factor in determining the true spread of COVID-19 and developing an effective treatment. \"We're not there yet. We'll be there soon,\ " he said. \"And then youth will become a very important part of that.\"
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV.

  The Public Health Agency of Canada is denying any connection between the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, two scientists who were escorted out of the building last summer, and the coronavirus outbreak in China.   Read this story in Chinese 中国科学家从温尼伯实验室中窃取 冠状病毒的网络传言'没有事实根据'   Baseless stories claiming that the two scientists are Chinese spies and that they smuggled the coronavirus to China's only Level 4 lab in Wuhan last year have been spreading on all major social media platforms and on conspiracy theorist blogs. One article from a conspiracy blog was shared more than 6,000 times on Facebook on Monday.   The story even made its way on Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, where a video pushing these claims was watched more than 350,000 times. \"This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,\ " Eric Morrissette, chief of media relations for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada said in response to queries by CBC News. The conspiracy theory seems to be based on a distorted reading of reporting from CBC News published last summer. One of the first mentions occurred Saturday on Twitter, where businessman Kyle Bass claimed that \"a husband and wife Chinese spy team were recently removed from a Level 4 Infectious Disease facility in Canada for sending pathogens to the Wuhan facility.\ " This photo of medical staff attending to patients was uploaded to the Weibo social media platform by the Central Hospital of Wuhan on Saturday. The city of Wuhan is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. (The Central Hospital of Wuhan via Weibo/Reuters) In the tweet, which was shared over 12,000 times, he linked to a story CBC News broke in July, revealing that a researcher, her husband, and some of their graduate students, were escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what's being described as a possible \"policy breach\" and \"administrative matter.\ "  The RCMP and Health Canada have both stressed that there was no danger for public safety. CBC reporting never claimed the two scientists were spies, or that they brought any version of the coronavirus to the lab in Wuhan. Experts say the disinformation is creating a \"social panic\" online. \"We've seen already on Twitter and Reddit and other platforms that there have been calls to ban travellers from China from entering North American or Europe — that there have been individuals targeted to be supposedly pulled off flights or stopped at the Canadian border or the U.S. border,\" says Fuyuki Kurasawa, director of the Global Digital Citizenship Lab at York University.    \"The broader damage is that there grows a mistrust toward both government authorities, public health officials, the media, authoritative sources of media, and there there becomes a social media environment where speculation, rumour and conspiracy theories take over and wash out the factual information that is being promoted online.\" Kurasawa is already seeing that spread from the online world to the real world. \"Individuals will take it on themselves to become vigilantes, where they'll try to spot someone who supposedly is either holding the truth about some hidden truth about the coronavirus or a person who may be a carrier or supposed carrier of the virus because they appear to have certain symptoms, and then they'll ask the general public to take matters into own hands,\" he says. Experts like Fuyuki Kurasawa, director of the Global Digital Citizenship Lab at York University, say disinformation about the coronavirus is creating a 'social panic' online. (Derek Hooper/CBC) Kernels of truth in disinformation Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is a medical doctor and virologist from Tianjin, China, who came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Qiu is still affiliated with the university there and has brought in many students over the years to help with her work. She helped develop ZMapp, a treatment for the deadly Ebola virus which killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa between 2014-2016. Her husband Keding Cheng works at the Winnipeg lab as a biologist. He has published research papers on HIV infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), E. coli infections and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.   One month later, CBC discovered that scientists at the NML sent live Ebola and Henipah viruses to Beijing on an Air Canada flight March 31. The Public Health Agency of Canada says all federal policies were followed. PHAC will not confirm if the March 31 shipment is part of the RCMP investigation.   Contrary to posts on Twitter, the coronavirus was not part of this shipment. And there is no confirmation Qiu or Cheng were the scientists behind the shipment. In another followup story using travel documents obtained in Access to Information requests, CBC reported that Qiu made at least five trips to China in 2017-18, including one to train scientists and technicians at China's newly certified Level 4 lab. She was invited to visit the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences twice a year for two years, for up to two weeks each time. The lab does research with the most deadly pathogens. PHAC has denied any connection between the RCMP investigation, Qiu's visits to Wuhan or any Canadian research, with the coronavirus outbreak.   However, PHAC would not comment on the current status of Qiu and Cheng, citing privacy reasons.   Communicate more effectively Heidi Tworek, assistant professor in international history at the University of British Columbia, says governments and public health authorities need to do a better job of communicating facts at times like this, including in the languages of the communities impacted. Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor in international history at University of British Columbia, says governments and public health agencies have to be more effective at communicating to the public because disinformation will spread faster than facts. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC) \"It's incredibly challenging during fast-moving outbreaks of any disease to balance between information to keep the public safe and prevent something from becoming a massive epidemic and also trying to provide truthful information and also providing enough so you don't end up with a vacuum, which is where disinformation can flourish,\ " Tworek says. \"We've seen in previous outbreaks it's been difficult to get this right, but I'd emphasize this is actually a crucial element of what we need to be thinking about into the future —  how do we actually communicate well and swiftly with general public with all types of health scares? This will not be the last time we face disinformation during a potential epidemic.\ "
  Researchers at McMaster University have developed a set of \"fish hooks\" capable of isolating the new coronavirus and have quickly released the new tool to the international community to help battle the outbreak. The innovation will help health scientists determine how the COVID-19 is spreading and track whether it's evolving. \"The reason we want to look at the genome of the virus is to make sure it's not changing as it passes through people and populations and possibly becoming more infective or more dangerous,\" explained Andrew McArthur, an associate professor and computational biologist at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research. Those \"hooks\" allows scientists to do the \"detective work\" to find out how it transmits between people and how well it survives outside the body, as well as learn more about its properties using next-generation sequencing, he added. The urgency of the outbreak and the fact McMaster doesn't have a sample of the cornoavirus led McArthur and his team to skip the typical peer-review and clinical evaluation stages and instead release their sequences publicly right away. \"Right now we just don't have that kind of time,\ " he explained in an interview with CBC. Ontario's 7th case of coronavirus reported in man who travelled to Iran ' We're at a decisive point': Hospitals ramp up pandemic plans for COVID-19 Instead the researchers are planning to work with Sunnybrook Hospital for future testing and are relying on scientists around the world to perform their own experiments. \"I'm hopeful someone in China or Italy maybe will be the first one,\" explained McArthur.  \"As long as someone does it I'll be content.\"   The \"hooks\" aren't aimed at diagnosing patients. They work by attaching with the virus's DNA, allowing them to cherry pick virus from among the other types of DNA included in biological samples. And that's not any easy task. \"The molecules you're after like the virus are really rare. It's a tiny fraction. It's really much worse than a needle in a haystack,\" said McArthur. Typically a virus is isolated using costly and time consuming processes such as culturing it in cells at contained labs by trained specialists  — an option that isn't always available or affordable in countries that have more limited resources. \"Not every municipality or country will have specialized labs and researchers, not to mention that culturing a virus is dangerous,\ " he stated in a media release from the university. \"This tool removes some of these barriers and allows for more widespread testing and analyses.\" From stocking up on supplies to changing travel plans, The National looks at how Canadians can prepare for a coronavirus outbreak and what may be unnecessary. 1:52 The team was able to put together the \"hooks\" so quickly because Jalees Nasir, a PhD candidate in biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, was already working with Sunnybrook to develop a tool to isolate respiratory viruses when the outbreak began. Nasir immediately pivoted his project, creating a \"sequence recipe\" to isolate COVID-19 specifically. \"When you have samples from a patient, for example, it can consist of a combination of virus, bacteria and human material, but you're really only interested in the virus,\ " Nasir said in the release. \"It's almost like a fishing expedition. We are designing baits that we can throw into the sample as hooks and pull out the virus from that mixture.\ " Now David Speicher, a postdoctoral fellow in McArthur's lab, is sharing details of the technology with the clinical epidemiology community around the globe. Wash hands, sneeze into sleeves, disinfect surfaces to reduce COVID-19 risk: WECHU McArthur and his team aren't just sharing their tool. They're also making behind the scenes work that went into it available to the public so that a sort of mass peer-review is possible. \"We designed this tool and are releasing it for use by others,\ " he said. \"In part, we're relying on our track record of knowing what we are doing, but we're also relying on people who have the virus samples in hand being able to do the validation experiment so that it's reliable.\"
  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  The United States on Friday declared a public health emergency and announced significant entry restrictions because of a new virus that hit China and has spread to other nations. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is co-ordinating the federal response, announced that U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an order that will temporarily bar entry to the U.S. of foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days. The new restrictions take effect at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday. \"It is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmissions,\ " Azar said. \"The American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.\" Americans returning from China will be allowed into the country, but will face screening at select ports of entry and required to undertake 14 days of self-screening to ensure they don't pose a health risk. Those returning from Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine. Beginning Sunday, the U.S. will also begin funnelling all flights to the U.S. from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened for illness. A public health emergency in the U.S. allows the government to tap additional resources to send to states, such as emergency funding and if necessary drugs or equipment from the national stockpile, and to suspend certain legal requirements. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakU.S. issues 'do not travel' warning as coronavirus death toll in China rises Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that while the risk in the U.S. is low, \"I want to emphasize that this is a significant global situation and it continues to evolve.\" The U.S. confirmed a seventh case of the virus on Friday. All were travellers except for a Chicago man who caught it from his wife, who had been in China. The total number of deaths from the coronavirus in China had reached 259 by the end of Friday, state broadcaster CCTV said, citing numbers from the country's National Health Commission. It said 45 of the new deaths were in Hubei province, and one in the municipality of Chongqing. It also said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China, bringing the total accumulated number to 11,791.

  As Canadian public health agencies prepare to deal with a new viral illness, a specialized lab in Saskatoon is using its research on different strains of the coronavirus to help develop a vaccine. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, also known as VIDO-InterVac, has received permission from the Public Health Agency of Canada to focus on the threat. \"People need to work together and collaborate and share the information,\" said its executive director, Volker Gerdts. The deadly coronavirus, first linked to a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has been connected to 26 deaths and infections in hundreds of people. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States have each reported at least one case of the virus. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada and officials say the risk of an outbreak remains low. CBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? About five or six people in Canada are being monitored, including those with a travel history to the Wuhan area and with symptoms of the illness. Respiratory samples are being sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. \"Emerging diseases arrive and, because of all the travel we do and the connectiveness we have right now, the world becomes smaller and smaller and there's a better chance for these pathogens to quickly spread around the globe,\ " Gerdts said. ' We have expertise' The Saskatchewan lab was developed in the wake of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2003 to ensure that Canada could be prepared for emerging disease and illness, he said. Researchers there have spent a significant amount of time focusing on pathogens like coronaviruses. Gerdts said they've successfully developed a vaccine for coronavirus strains in cattle and pigs. \"We have expertise in working with them.\ " While coronaviruses are relatively small, they are known for mutating and jumping species, which is why they cause so many problems. Gerdts explained the coronavirus strain in pigs had not been seen in North America until two years ago. But within a year it had affected 10 million of the animals. ' Just incredible:' Mass quarantines take China into uncharted territory Colleagues in China have made the outbreak-specific coronavirus genome sequence available to researchers around the world, Gerdts said. His lab is now using it to hopefully find a way to help. The lab also has clearance to handle samples of the pathogen and is attempting to get samples from China or the U.S. If that's not possible, it will order synthetic gene fragments. The goal is to have the first vaccine candidates ready for testing in animals within six to eight weeks, Gerdts said. But human trials are at least a year away. Gerdts said Canada has taken a leading role in developing vaccines, including one for the Ebola virus, and there's a need to have more capacity to manufacture them here. If his lab had a manufacturing facility that he's been advocating for, he said production of a coronavirus vaccine for human testing could happen quicker. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Canadian research is part of a global effort and will be shared with the World Health Organization. \"We currently do not have a specific vaccine against this novel coronavirus,\ " she said. \"With a global effort on preparedness, I think that's something that we need to strive for.\"
  Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are aiming to develop a vaccine that could help address an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed six people in China.   On Monday, Chinese health officials on the frontline of the outbreak confirmed to state media that human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred and the number of cases has more than tripled, according to the Associated Press. The outbreak is believed to have started in a seafood market in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan, but it has since spread to Beijing and Guangdong. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television that 258 cases had been confirmed in the city, with six deaths. The outbreak has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003. U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airportsChina confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus Now, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) have requested to work with the virus through the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.   \"In house now we're designing strategies of how we can vaccinate for the disease and how we could test such a vaccine,\" said Volker Gerdts, executive director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac. Volker Gerdts, CEO and executive director of VIDO-InterVac on the University of Saskatchewan campus, says the lab is in the early stages of developing a vaccine to treat a strain of coronavirus that is currently spreading throughout China and nearby countries.   (Submitted by Debrah Marshall) Gerdts said researchers at VIDO-InterVac have extensive experience with coronavirus, as the first vaccine for the virus in cattle was developed at the lab, with research around the virus continuing today. However, Gerdts said they're now looking to develop a vaccine specifically for the virus affecting China, which has come to be known as the Wuhan strain. Since the sequence of the virus was just released last week, they're still in the very early stages of research. \"It's really driving innovation, driving technology, but it's not something that can happen overnight,\ " he said. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, screening measures have been implemented at ports of entry in some neighbouring countries for passengers arriving from Wuhan.   \"The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners to gather additional information,\" said the agency on its website.   It's also initiated new screening measures at Canadian airports in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, which will remind residents travelling from Wuhan to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health question will also be added to electronic immigration kiosks. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakScreening measures initiated at Vancouver airport for China coronavirus outbreak Gerdts said right now, the risk to Canadians is low, but noted if you develop flu-like symptoms, after flying to the affected areas, you should contact a public health office. \"There are a number of steps that we'll take from there, but really the chances are very, very low and so there's no reason at the moment to panic.\ "
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV. 
  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"
  Researchers in Ottawa are now part of the worldwide race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, and they're using what they've learned on their hunt for a cancer cure as their road map.   The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute team received a $250,000 grant from the Thistledown Foundation, a charity founded by the Ottawa entrepreneur and Shopify founder Tobi Lütke and his wife Fiona McKean. The effort is a joint project between researchers John Bell and Carolina Ilkow. Bell is senior scientist in the cancer therapeutics program at the institute and a professor at the University of Ottawa. He spoke to Robyn Bresnahan on CBC's Ottawa Morning. Their interview is edited for length. What does it feel like to be working on a vaccine right now for COVID-19? It's really exciting. We want to be part of the solution to this problem that's affected the whole world. My team has been working on this for about a month and a half now, 24 hours a day, trying to get something that will be a useful vaccine to help stop this pandemic. Researchers at work at The Ottawa Hospital's Biotherapeutics Manufacturing Centre. (The Ottawa Hospital) Where do you start? It's a good question. My group, along with my colleague, Dr. Carolina Ilkow, has worked for many years to try to develop virus-based therapeutics to treat cancer. One of the things we've learned is that you can use these viruses to stimulate the immune system of a cancer patient.  So our thinking when this pandemic broke was maybe we can use the same ideas and the same technology to generate immune responses against the virus that's causing the COVID-19 pandemic.   So you can fight a virus with a virus? That's basically it. We take a very benign virus and we use that as a vaccine. We paint that virus with proteins that come from the virus which is causing the pandemic in the first place, and so it basically vaccinates the person and makes them think they're infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, but they're not. They've actually just been treated with a very benign virus. And so their immune system then responds, and if the COVID virus comes by [their immune system] recognizes it right away and eliminates it. Does the virus that you might treat COVID-19 with — does it have to be stronger or weaker than the COVID-19 virus? It's actually a virus which doesn't really cause any pathology or sickness in people at all. It's a very benign virus that's been used for hundreds of years to vaccinate people and prevent them from getting other diseases. It's a bit of a Trojan Horse. It goes in there and convinces the immune system that [the body] is being infected with a more potent virus.  It's really just a matter of disguising that virus to make it look like the one that causes COVID-19.  You then develop an immune response against it, and if the COVID-19 virus comes by you're already immune to it.   Carolina Ilkow is a key member of the Ottawa research team, using lessons learned in the hunt for cancer cures to seek a potential vaccine for COVID-19. (The Ottawa Hospital) There are so many scientists around the world that are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. As far as you know, are you the first team that's using what you know about cancer to translate this onto COVID-19? Yes, I think we're probably the only ones who are using exactly the kinds of technology that we've developed to try to make a vaccine. But as you point out, lots of people are racing toward this. It's a great thing actually, because we're going to come to the solution eventually, whether it's from us or from the group in the U.K. or elsewhere. We're all learning from each other about what's working and what's not working. In some ways it's united scientists around the world in a common cause. It doesn't matter if it's our vaccine or someone else's — whatever works   — that's what we're going to be happy about .   ' A race against the disease': Canadian researchers part of global effort to develop COVID-19 vaccine ' We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up COVID-19 vaccine research takes on new urgency   Now that you and your team are focusing on this what does that mean for your cancer research? We're learning from what we're doing with making a vaccine for COVID-19 and we're applying that back to our cancer research. So although in a way we've had to step back a little bit, it's the same people working hard and learning as we go along.  I'm hoping that we'll get more information from this approach and that will hopefully accelerate what we're doing to try to develop cures for cancer. The OHRI COVID-19 research team received a $250,000 grant from the Thistledown Foundation, a charity founded by the Ottawa entrepreneur and Shopify founder Tobi Lütke, pictured here, and his wife, Fiona McKean. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) You couldn't do this without funding. What was your reaction on learning it was coming from people within your own city? That was very cool. A shout out to  Tobi and Fiona for stepping up and putting money into a large pot that was really available to everybody around the world. We had to compete for this and it was a process that involved experts from around the world looking at our proposal. So we feel very fortunate to have gotten it. But I think it's great they stepped up and said, \"Here's something we can do.\ " If your team succeeds in helping to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 what would that mean to you? Anybody would be totally thrilled, if that's how it turns out. The people on my team really deserve a shout-out for all the work they do every single day in a very difficult situation. I would be very proud of what they've done to actually achieve this goal, if we get there. 
  HIV and malaria medications are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 in B.C. as nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus provincewide. According to provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral Remdesivir — at one point used to to treat Ebola — are currently being tested on patients inside at least one facility in B.C. Outbreaks have occurred inside 12 long-term care homes in the province. \"There has been some experimental use [of the medications] all within the protocols of the international trials that we in Canada are part of,\ " Henry said at her latest coronavirus briefing on Saturday. Since mid-March, the federal government has been working with international regulators to fast track clinical trials for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says more therapeutics will be tested in the coming days and weeks as researchers look for ways to treat COVID-19 before a vaccine is produced. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) A vaccine won't be ready for up to 18 months, so researchers have been focused on using existing medications to treat COVID-19. While some patients have been undergoing the experimental treatment, the bulk of the research in B.C. has been taking place inside labs at the University of British Columbia and the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, Henry said. B.C. records 1 new death and 92 new cases on Saturday, bringing provincial total to 884 Touted by Trump, cautioned by Canada Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir have been tested overseas, particularly in China, Henry said. Early progress prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to tell a crowd of reporters that anti-malaria medications were showing \"very, very encouraging early results.\" President Donald Trump listens to coronavirus response co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx speak during a briefing on March 20. He later told reporters anti-malaria medication was showing very encouraging results for treating COVID-19 although public health officials caution citizens against taking the drugs.    (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press) Public health officials were quick to temper expectations — and urge caution — following his remarks.   Earlier this week, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Therese Tam urged Canadians not to take medication without the scientific evidence. Q&A'This isn't Halloween candy': Infectious disease specialist cautious over drugs touted as COVID-19 treatment \"It can be quite dangerous. These drugs are not without side effects.

Tam said part of Canada's participation in the network includes making sure patients will receive drugs supported by research.   Chief public health officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam warned Canadians that there is still no definitive scientific proof that anti-malaria medication is effective in treating COVID-19.

More therapies on the way Hydroxychloroquine is also being tested on COVID-19 patients by researchers at the University of Manitoba — a joint trial in conjunction with researchers in Alberta and Minnesota. Other labs across Canada and the U.S. have ramped up testing on a swath of new drugs in hopes of quelling the widening outbreak. CBC InvestigatesDoctors face sanctions for prescribing unproven COVID-19 drugs to friends and family, regulators warn Dr. Henry says B.C. will continue to do its part in helping determine which medications might be effective. \"Our critical care physicians are watching the data of course that's going on around the world,\ " she said. \"So there will be more use of all the potential therapeutics.\"
  U.S. researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday — leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges. With a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe. \"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\" The Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. Dr. Lisa Jackson is leading the first-stage safety study of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, which was given to the first volunteer in the study by injection on Monday in Seattle. (Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press) \"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\ " Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot. She's the mother of two teenagers, and \"they think it's cool\ " that she's taking part in the study. After the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\" Just the beginning Monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Still, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\ " Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself. The City of Montreal announced it would be adding staff at the Trudeau airport to inform travellers about the risks and measures being taken associated with COVID-19. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) It's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study — in the United States, China and South Korea — next month. The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500. COVID-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, cancelling entertainment and sporting events and encouraging people to stay away from each other. Taking it slow Starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the U.S. struck early and hard by the virus. Still, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there … to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP. Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice. \"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\ " Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\" A security guard opens the door for a person entering a COVID-19 assessment facility on Saturday in Ottawa. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Most of the vaccine research underway globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected. Researchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus's genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine. The idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack — and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus. European nations grapple with a united plan to combat coronavirusNeed help with your errands? Online groups, neighbours are pitching in during coronavirus pandemic That's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it. But because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate. \"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week. The Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centres that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before COVID-19 began spreading widely in Washington state. Kaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of COVID-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 US for each clinic visit in the study. 
  The new Middle East coronavirus doesn't spread between patients often enough at this point to reach pandemic potential, a mathematical study suggests. In Wednesday's online issue of the medical journal The Lancet, French researchers analyzed data on 55 of 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide as of June 20. The number of people infected by a single case of MERS coronavirus varies, without secondary infections, makes it harder to assess its pandemic potential. (National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Canadian Press) \"Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential,\" concluded Arnaud Fontanet of the Pasteur Institute in Paris and his co-authors. Their statistical analysis helps determine whether each infected person will infect more than one person, said Chris Bauch, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Waterloo who wrote a journal commentary on the study. The measurement is called the basic reproduction number or R value. \"If each infected person infects one person on average then it will die out,\ " Bauch said. If the R value is greater than 1.0, then cases can grow exponentially and cause a full-blown pandemic. In the worst case scenario in Fontanet's study, the MERS coronavirus had an R value of 0.69 compared with 0.80 when SARS was prepandemic. The SARS coronavirus infected more than 8,000 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003 and 774 deaths were linked to it.   When SARS reached an epidemic level in many widespread countries  —  a pandemic — its R value was estimated at between 2.2 and 3.7. SARS also reached that level in months, while the MERS coronavirus has been circulating for more than a year. SARS, MERS and a few common colds are coronaviruses with similarities and differences in how they seem to infect human airways and cause illness in humans. Part of the problem in assessing the pandemic potential of MERS is that the number of secondary infections, or how many people are infected by a single case, is so variable, Bauch said. \"The conclusion of this study is that the MERS Co-V virus as we currently understand it, as we currently know it, does not have the potential to cause a pandemic. However, we need to continue being vigilant, continue refining our mathematical calculations and, of course, public health needs to continue doing the great job it's doing to stay on top of this,\ " Bauch said. It is also possible that milder causes of MERS have gone undetected, which would raise estimates of the R value, the French researchers said. Public health experts and researchers also need to consider factors such as how viruses can mutate to enter the body more easily or not, and how different seasonal conditions could affect transmission. MERS patient dies in London On Wednesday, a British hospital announced that a man infected with MERS had died in hospital. \"Guy's and St Thomas' can confirm that the patient with severe respiratory illness due to novel coronavirus sadly died on Friday 28 June, after his condition deteriorated despite every effort and full supportive treatment,\ " the hospital said in an emailed statement. The man was flown to St Thomas' Hospital in London from Qatar in September last year, BBC News reported. The World Health Organization says more than 40 people have died from MERS.

  New COVID-19 modelling released today shows that public health measures are working to slow the spread of COVID-19 — but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that easing pandemic restrictions too quickly could lead to a dangerous setback. Provinces released new guidelines on how to safely reopen business and schools and loosen physical distancing rules this afternoon, just hours after federal health officials delivered positive projections on expected new cases and deaths. Trudeau urged Canadians to stay the course. \"The measures we have taken so far are working. In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened. But we are not out of the woods yet,\ " Trudeau said during his daily briefing. \"We are in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen, and if we lift measures too quickly, we could lose the progress we've made.\" As of Tuesday morning, Canada had recorded more than 49,000 reported cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,700 deaths. Watch: Trudeau on the long-term need for pandemic restrictions Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says public health measures are working to slow the spread of COVID-19, but cautioned that easing restrictions too fast could reverse the progress made to date. 3:25 Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, cited some positive pandemic news in the new modelling data. Caseload growth is slowing across the country and Canada has experienced slower growth than many other countries, she said. The number of new cases of COVID-19 was doubling every three days previously, and is now doubling every 16 days. Short-term projections predict between 53,191 and 66,835 cases by May 5, and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths by that date. LIVE BLOG RECAPCOVID-19 April 28 update: PM, Health Canada officials present updated COVID-19 projections | Special coverageINTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Sunday Tam said the revised projections reflect the \"heavy toll\" the virus is taking on vulnerable populations. Right now, most of the deaths — about 79 per cent — are occurring in long-term care facilities and seniors' homes. The virus is also proving difficult to contain in other environments, such as homeless shelters, prisons and jails and group homes. Watch: Trudeau asked whether he would send his kids back to school in two weeks, as Quebec is proposing: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Tuesday. 1:54 There are also regional differences. While the number of cases has levelled off in several provinces, the caseload in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta is \"driving\" the epidemic's growth in Canada, Tam said. There are no cases in Nunavut and no community spread in Prince Edward Island, Northwest Territories or Yukon. For the virus to die out, the average number of people to whom an infected individual passes the virus has to drop below one. Tam said that, right now, strong controls such as physical distancing and self-isolation have limited the average number of people each case infects to slightly more than one. Avoiding future 'waves' Tam warned that public health measures will need to remain in place until there is a high level of immunity or a vaccine to avoid \"future epidemic waves.\ " To stay on course, she said, Canadians must continue physical distancing, contact tracing and quarantine measures. \"It is critical to remember that once we are on the downside of the slope, we must absolutely remain vigilant and continue our public health measures,\ " she said. Watch: Dr. Theresa Tam on the pandemic 'marathon' Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, says Canadians will not be going back to what life was like before January until there is enough immunity in the population to protect against the COVID-19 virus. 3:27 Tam said that while she recognizes the impact of pandemic measures on the economy, Canadians' mental health and gender-based violence, no one should expect to resume their former daily routine for some time yet. \"It is a very delicate balance that we all have to really manage very well,\ " she said.   \"We all understand that if the virus accelerates again, that would be a massive setback to the gains that we've already had. So we've got to keep going at it. This is absolutely still a marathon.\" Tam first released the federal government's COVID-19 modelling on April 9. Those projections included a number of scenarios and long-term forecasts, including a death toll of between 11,000 and 22,000 over the course of the pandemic — even with ongoing physical distancing and other disease control measures. The long-term projections did not change today, but Tam warned that there could be a significant \"second wave\" of infections if Canadians drop their guard. Testing, contact tracing are keys to easing social restrictions. But is Canada ready?COVID-19 deaths surpass federal projections due to outbreaks in long-term care homes, Trudeau says A guiding framework on reopening economies — jointly agreed to by the federal, provincial and territorial governments — was released today. The document says first ministers have agreed on a \"gradual and phased approach\" to lifting restrictions to protect the health of Canadians, shield high-risk groups and ensure the health care system retains the capacity to respond to future outbreaks. They also agreed the plan must support a broad range of economic sectors. The plan's preconditions for easing restrictions and reopening economies include:  COVID-19 transmission coming under control, so that health care systems can manage the number of new cases with \"substantial\" clinical care capacity and a stabilized number of hospitalizations, with the possible exception of isolated outbreaks. Public health capacity that's sufficient to test, trace and isolate cases. Supports to help vulnerable groups and communities. Measures to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in workplaces. A plan to limit the risk of importing the virus by easing and managing restrictions on non-essential domestic travel in a coordinated manner, while recognizing that reopening international borders may happen only in later stages.   Trudeau said Canadians' actions going forward will decide whether the progress continues. ' It all depends on us' \"It all depends on us. You've already stepped up to help your family, friends and neighbours stay safe, and your governments across the country are stepping up as well,\" he said. \"We are a big country, and we don't always agree on everything. But right now, the premiers and the federal government are working together to fight this crisis.\ " Watch: Full press conference to release updated COVID-19 projections Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam and Canada's deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo provided updated projections on the number of potential cases and deaths in Canada from COVID-19. 1:01:48 Some provinces, such as Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Ontario, already have released tentative plans to ease those restrictions. Quebec Premier François Legault has announced plans to begin reopening schools, businesses and day cares in the coming weeks. Ontario Premier Doug Ford is taking a more cautious approach. He released a plan for a staged reopening process but stressed it is a \"roadmap, not a calendar.\" Ontario's framework says the province must see a \"consistent two-to-four-week decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases\" before the government begins loosening restrictions.

  Researchers are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, but new data suggests that some people wouldn't get vaccinated even if that option became available.   Gordon Asmundson, a psychology professor at the University of Regina, is studying how psychological factors affect COVID-19's spread. The study involves three waves of surveying and is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) as part of their COVID-19 Rapid Response Initiative. Asmundson received $400,000 in funding for his research project COVID-19: The Role of Psychological Factors in the Spreading of Disease, Discrimination, and Distress, undertaken in collaboration with Steven Taylor from the University of British Columbia. \"About 20 per cent of individuals indicated [in the first wave of surveying] that should a vaccine become available, they won't be likely to take it,\ " Asmundson said. \"That's concerning given all of the push and efforts to find that vaccine.\"  The sample size for the first wave was just shy of 7,000 people in Canada and the United States. The data was collected through an internet self-report survey done by data-gathering company Qualtrics between March 21 and April 1. \"If one in five people are not going to take it, that's going to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of [stopping] the virus, of mitigating spread.\" Dr. Gordon Asmundson is a professor at the University of Regina, a mental health scientist and a registered clinical psychologist. He studies the psychological factors of epidemics and pandemics. (University of Regina Photography) Last year, WHO named \"vaccine hesitancy\ " — people unsure about the safety or efficacy of vaccines — a Top 10 threat to global health.   Asmundson said data on vaccine hesitancy will be published within the next month, following the second wave of collection.   Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab was not available for an interview, according to the Ministry of Health. He has previously said restrictions like physical distancing will be in place until a vaccine, a treatment or significant immunity is in place.   Nearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why. How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine   Other factors assessed  Asmundson said they are conducting two more waves of surveying so they can measure potential changes in attitude. This will offer insight into how people are emotionally responding to COVID-19, which is \"not a one-size fits all stressor.\ "  For example, some questions look at dreaming and sleep patterns.   \"Those who are most anxious are coping by sleeping more but they're also reporting more trouble sleeping,\ " Asmundson said based on the first survey results. People reported more intrusive thoughts while awake and more bad dreams featuring bad outcomes while asleep.    Maintaining mental health and mindfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic   Asmundson said it's no surprise the virus is lurking in people's dreams because of the \"constant barrage of media attention,\" changes to daily life and a rising global death toll. Intense emotions like fear often fuel dream content, he added, as the brain uses dreams to process information.   \"This is having a huge toll on people,\ " he said. \"It's really important for people to stop and check how they're doing in terms of their mental health.\"   He said the data collection has also shown that there is a group of people who appear extraordinarily overwhelmed by the virus. In contrast, there is another group of people who aren't particularly concerned by it and might not adhere to public health advice, which could affect how the virus spreads. The end goal of the research is to develop a \"rapid assessment system that can be used to assess, for any pandemic or major epidemic, infection-related excessive anxiety and xenophobia, and risk factors for these problems.\" 
  We're answering your questions about the pandemic. Send yours to COVID@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday online, and also put some questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network. So far we've received more than 30,000 emails from all corners of the country. Your questions have surprised us, stumped us and got us thinking, including a number about restaurant reopenings including this one from Eli R: Why are restaurant and kitchen staff not wearing masks? Another sector that's getting the go-ahead to reopen, with restrictions, in several provinces is the restaurant industry, although in Manitoba and Quebec, restaurants will be open for take-out, delivery, patio and walk-up service only. So why aren't kitchen and other restaurant staff wearing masks or other protective gear if they're serving the public?   Many are wearing masks, but it's not mandatory. The coronavirus is not food-borne, and the chance of transmission through food preparation is quite low. Frequent hand-washing, particularly before or after handling food and containers, can further mitigate the risks.   You can read more about COVID-19 and food in earlier editions of the FAQ.   INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday Dr. Peter Lin, CBC medical specialist and family doctor, suggests kitchen staff should keep two metres apart and customer-facing personnel should also maintain physical distancing and wear masks.   Health Canada also has tips for restaurants which include using masks when available. The national organization Restaurants Canada says it's working to ensure that food service operators are kept up to date on guidance from the government.   Read more about how restaurants across Canada are handling COVID-19. Why is it okay to get a haircut, but not visit with friends and family? As some provinces start reopening next week, Oreleen L., from Manitoba, wonders why it's safe to get a haircut, but not to visit with friends and family. As far as hair salons go, yes, as of May 4 you can get a haircut in Manitoba; however, hair stylists and barbers must follow restrictions before they can open. These include:  Staff and clients must use the self-screening tool before booking an appointment.   Employees must stay home when ill with COVID-19 symptoms. Clients are screened by telephone before an appointment is booked and are not seen if they have COVID-19 symptoms. Appointment times are staggered to allow for physical distancing, and clients should attend alone, without friends or family.   In provinces like New Brunswick, where hair stylists are still waiting for the go-ahead to reopen, some salons are putting up plexiglass barriers to comply with physical distancing rules, in the hope that they will be able to see customers again soon.    Coronavirus: The latest in drug treatment and vaccine development Oreleen L. also wants to know why she can't visit family and friends. According to a Manitoba provincial spokesperson, visiting with family has never been prohibited in the province, but limited contact with others helps flatten the curve. \"Social distancing guidelines remain in place and work by limiting the number of people that you and your family come into close contact with,\ " the province says.   Is Canada looking into using remdesivir? The U.S. is fast-tracking approval of a drug to help treat COVID-19 called remdesivir, which top health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said, has a \"clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\" after favourable results of a clinical trial. We've had several people, including JP L., ask whether Canada will be using this antiviral drug as a treatment. Remdesivir, which impairs the coronavirus's ability to replicate, was initially used to treat Ebola, but is not officially approved for use in Canada. Yet, some hospitals are getting access to it through \"individual compassionate use.\" COVID-19 vaccine research takes on new urgency What does this mean?  Health Canada has a program, which allows particular, unapproved drugs to be used in unique cases. Health Canada states the makers of remdesivir, Gilead, is transitioning to this \"provision of emergency access\" but can no longer accept more requests due to \"an overwhelming demand.\ " In an email to CBC News, Gilead said it is ramping up production but did not specify how much remdesivir would be sent to Canada.   WATCH | Vik Adhopia on The National about remdesivir's clinical trial:   The antiviral drug remdesivir is showing promise as a COVID-19 treatment in early U.S. clinical trials, though other research hasn’t seen as much success. 1:59 Can I move during the pandemic?    Today is May 1, meaning rent and moving are on the minds of many, including Pauline B., who wonders if she can change residences during the pandemic.   The short answer is yes, there are no rules preventing it. But remember, the less you stay at home, the more your risk to potential exposure climbs. \"It's a tough time to be undertaking a move,\" said Dr. Samir Gupta, respirologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto. 1 in 3 Canadians worry they'll miss rent or mortgage payment due to COVID-19 — survey He explains that moves often require a lot of exposure to various surfaces, such as door knobs and handles, which are some of the riskiest forms of transmission of the coronavirus. He urges those moving to be aware of how many surfaces they touch and to maintain good hand hygiene. \"Be very cognizant of handwashing,\ " he said. \"We say it again and again but it really is the very best way for someone to protect themselves.\" Some of the movers we contacted are also taking extra precautions, including giving crews hand sanitizer and instructing them to physically distance whenever possible.

  Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are aiming to develop a vaccine that could help address an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed six people in China.   On Monday, Chinese health officials on the frontline of the outbreak confirmed to state media that human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred and the number of cases has more than tripled, according to the Associated Press. The outbreak is believed to have started in a seafood market in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan, but it has since spread to Beijing and Guangdong. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television that 258 cases had been confirmed in the city, with six deaths. The outbreak has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003. U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airportsChina confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus Now, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) have requested to work with the virus through the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.   \"In house now we're designing strategies of how we can vaccinate for the disease and how we could test such a vaccine,\" said Volker Gerdts, executive director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac. Volker Gerdts, CEO and executive director of VIDO-InterVac on the University of Saskatchewan campus, says the lab is in the early stages of developing a vaccine to treat a strain of coronavirus that is currently spreading throughout China and nearby countries.   (Submitted by Debrah Marshall) Gerdts said researchers at VIDO-InterVac have extensive experience with coronavirus, as the first vaccine for the virus in cattle was developed at the lab, with research around the virus continuing today. However, Gerdts said they're now looking to develop a vaccine specifically for the virus affecting China, which has come to be known as the Wuhan strain. Since the sequence of the virus was just released last week, they're still in the very early stages of research. \"It's really driving innovation, driving technology, but it's not something that can happen overnight,\ " he said. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, screening measures have been implemented at ports of entry in some neighbouring countries for passengers arriving from Wuhan.   \"The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners to gather additional information,\" said the agency on its website.   It's also initiated new screening measures at Canadian airports in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, which will remind residents travelling from Wuhan to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health question will also be added to electronic immigration kiosks. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakScreening measures initiated at Vancouver airport for China coronavirus outbreak Gerdts said right now, the risk to Canadians is low, but noted if you develop flu-like symptoms, after flying to the affected areas, you should contact a public health office. \"There are a number of steps that we'll take from there, but really the chances are very, very low and so there's no reason at the moment to panic.\ "
  A viral video by an American doctor who is on disciplinary probation claims that the coronavirus pandemic was caused by 5G technology.   However, it contains many false claims and inaccuracies that are easily debunked by virologists, CBC News has found. In the video, Dr. Thomas Cowan claims viruses are the waste from cells that are poisoned. Some of the poisoning, he said, comes from electromagnetic fields. How did the video go viral?   The original video was uploaded to YouTube on March 12. It quickly went viral and racked up 16,000 shares and 390,000 views within a week. Many more copies of the video exist online, some with translations in different languages. At least five other YouTube users have uploaded it to their channels.   The video has also been uploaded by more than a dozen Facebook pages, as well as on Instagram and Twitter. It was notably shared on Instagram by American singer Keri Hilson to her 2.3 millions followers. After it sparked controversy, Hilson deleted her post. A media aggregate app shows how the 5G video has been shared in numerous languages and countries.   (CrowdTangle) It's impossible to measure how many shares and views this video garnered in total, but it has been viewed by at least several hundreds of thousands of people.   Debunking the claims In the video, Cowan claims that viruses are simply the byproduct of a cell that has been poisoned.    One of Canada's top virologists says that isn't so. \"Viruses are not just debris,\" said Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist and Canada research chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba. \"Viruses don't just get created as a way to deal with poison.\ " WATCH |  A virologist explains why he is certain the pandemic was caused by a virus and not 5G : Kindrachuk explains why he is certain the global pandemic has been caused by a virus and not 5G. 0:42 Viruses, Kindrachuck said, are small pieces of genetic material surrounded by a protein coat.    \"The virus basically is essentially inert until it basically binds specifically to certain types of cells,\ " Kindrachuck said. \"Once it gets inside of our cell, it releases its genomic material and then it uses basically our host cell machinery to create more and more and more copies of itself.\ "  As proof that the cause of the global pandemic is not debris, Kindracuk points to various scientific investigations into the coronavirus, including the fact researchers have been able to take it apart physically and put the virus sequence back together and use it to infect primates.   Prepare to see COVID-19 cases rising. That doesn't mean social distancing has failed The data-driven pandemic: Information sharing with COVID-19 is 'unprecedented'  \"We've been able to put that virus into rhesus macaques, which are a non-human primate and are very similar to humans in terms of how they respond to many different pathogens and illnesses,\" said Kindrachuk.   \"Those animals get sick with something that looks kind of like mild COVID-19. So I think the data is so overwhelmingly valid.\ " Kindrachuk also said he has seen variations of the theory that 5G causes illness emerge long before the COVID-19 outbreak. \"It's actually been something that the anti-vax community has used fairly frequently as part of their argument against vaccination. So I'm not surprised. I'm disenchanted by the fact that even during a pandemic and a global health crisis, that this stuff keeps resurfacing,\ " Kindrachuck said. Other inaccuracies and fabrications Many other claims made by Cowan in the video don't hold up to scrutiny. For example, he said the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic coincided with the worldwide introduction of radio, proving that radio waves caused the outbreak. However, the first commercial radio station, XWA from Montreal, started broadcasting in 1920. He also claims that the Boston health department tried to experiment with the 1918 flu virus by purposefully infecting healthy people with the mucus of infected patients, and that the result was that the healthy people didn't get sick. There is no proof this ever happened. The only mentions of this story we found on the internet were either on Cowan's site or on forums mentioning Cowan's newsletter. Indeed, health authorities at the time, in Boston and elsewhere, were quite aware that the outbreak was caused by a virus that could easily spread. For example, authorities in Boston asked women who were dating sailors, one of the first groups to introduce the outbreak to the U.S. mainland, not to kiss them so as not to catch the disease. Nurses care for victims of a Spanish influenza epidemic during an outdoor fresh air cure in Lawrence, Mass., in 1918. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Boston health department was even lauded in 1990 in the American Journal of Public Health for using open-air hospitals to slow down the spread of the 1918 virus.   According to a review of public health records, the journal found that \"a combination of fresh air, sunlight, scrupulous standards of hygiene and reusable face masks appears to have substantially reduced deaths among some patients and infections among medical staff.\"  COVID-19 vaccine research takes on new urgency   Cowan claims that Wuhan, the location where the COVID-19 outbreak began, was the first city to be covered by 5G. He insists that this is proof that these two things are linked. However, cities in South Korea and the U.S. had 5G networks before Wuhan did.   Also of note, Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network, alongside other countries like Japan and Malaysia, also hit hard by the pandemic.   Who is the man in the video? Cowan is an American holistic medical practitioner who trained as a physician.   He is currently operating on probation with the medical board in California and has limits on his practice after a 2017 complaint to the state medical board that, among other things, he had offered an unlicensed drug to a breast cancer patient without informing her it wasn't approved for use.   He also never saw the patient in person nor did he review her full medical file, according to documents from the Medical Board of California detailing why Cowan was to be disciplined. Cowan has authored several books that promote ideas contrary to conventional medical wisdom including one that argues against the immunization of children.   What you need to know about social distancing Interactive - Tracking the coronavirus   Cowan's viral theory on 5G and the spread of coronavirus was recorded earlier this month in Tucson, Ariz., at a conference put on by a group called the Humans for Humanity Coalition. That event was also attended by people opposed to vaccines, including discredited researcher Andrew Wakefield, whose study linking the MMR shot to autism in children was retracted in 2010.   Cowan did not respond to CBC News's request for comment.

  From tinkling harmonies as the virus disarms cells to clashing and stormy as it replicates, U.S. scientists have translated the novel coronavirus' spiked protein structure to music in an effort to better understand the pathogen. Professor Markus Buehler at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his team used artificial intelligence to transform a model of the protein structure of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus is formally called, into interwoven melodies in a classical musical composition. Researchers assigned each amino acid — the building blocks of the protein — a unique note. An algorithm then converted these notes into music. Buehler believes the tune offers a more intuitive way for people to comprehend the protein. \"You would need many different images, many different magnifications to see with your eyes, what your ears can pick up with just a couple of seconds of music,\ " Buehler said. Listeners call music 'soothing, ' 'scary' The composition runs nearly an hour and 50 minutes and has been uploaded to the SoundCloud website. The early part of composition has been described by several SoundCloud listeners as \"soothing\" and \"beautiful.\" Buehler said this reflects the ease of the spiked protein entering the human cell, making it so contagious. \"It's very efficient in tricking the cell to open up the doors, infecting you and propagating itself,\" Buehler explained. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 21Second OpinionWhy COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think As the virus replicates and the spiked protein binds to more cells, the music turns dramatic and tumultuous. One SoundCloud user noted that this section reflects when the coronavirus triggers a fever. Others described the part as \"scary\" and \"sad.\ " Several likened the composition to a single, called Virus, from Icelandic artist Björk's 2011 album Biophilia.   Buehler said the music might help researchers design an antibody. Researchers could take a musical counterpoint to the virus' melody and rhythm and, using artificial intelligence again, try to find an antibody that matches it. The rapid spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, has made it important to \"open our brains to other ways of processing information,\ " Buehler said. \"The traditional approach, where you make a bunch of proteins and you do clinical trials and you keep repeating them —that maybe takes a couple of years. We don't have the luxury of time,\" Buehler said. 
  A Dalhousie University researcher at the forefront of Canada's quest to find a treatment for COVID-19 says human trials for a new vaccine could be only weeks away. Dalhousie's COVID-19 rapid response team is moving forward with testing a vaccine that uses a genome of DNA from SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"We're beginning to evaluate this in animal models and we can even bring this into people for Phase 1 clinical trials as soon as three weeks from now,\ " virologist Alyson Kelvin told CBC's Information Morning on Wednesday. \"Right now, DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in people, so we hope that this will help expedite the process of vaccine development.\" How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine But Kelvin, an assistant professor in Dalhousie's department of microbiology and immunology, also cautioned that it typically takes a year for vaccines to be developed, tested and distributed to the general public. Alyson Kelvin is working with three vaccines developed by a Halifax molecular virologist and a vaccine developed by a scientist at the centre. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press) \"We're working as hard as we can to move this as fast as possible,\ " she said. \"We have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this isn't the best vaccine that we can put forth.\ " There are now 68 cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, which has been under a state of emergency since Sunday. Halifax father-daughter duo researching 'rapid response' tests, vaccines to combat COVID-19 Unlike a typical flu vaccine that's created using protein from a virus, Kelvin said the vaccine her team is testing uses a piece of the virus's DNA. \"And it uses your own cells to produce protein that will teach your immune system what the virus looks like,\ " she said.   Kelvin said the DNA vaccine was developed by her colleague, Roy Duncan, and is one of three types of vaccines the team is evaluating right now.   How long will it take? Kelvin said SARS CoV-2 is a good candidate for a vaccine because coronaviruses don't mutate as quickly as the influenza virus does.   The virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its DNA when it replicates and infects a host, she said.   \"Which means that the virus and its proteins are a bit more stable so we can target it better.\" VIDO-InterVac, the Saskatoon-based lab where Kelvin is working as a visiting professor, began researching a vaccine in January, and just received $23 million from the federal government to keep doing that work.   But even with an influx of funding, and with scientists around the world working feverishly, vaccine development can be a long and complicated process. Kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time COVID-19 returns. \"There's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus. If this is the case, we'll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back,\ " Kelvin said.   In the meantime, stay home As researchers spend long days in the lab, Nova Scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning, Kelvin said. Stay home, and if you must go out, stay away from other people.   \"Social distancing is now the best weapon for fighting this virus,\ " she said.   Dal researchers sending medical supplies to heart of coronavirus outbreak Kelvin will be part of an online panel about COVID-19 on Wednesday night hosted by the MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance at Dalhousie University.

  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation.

  B.C. could ease some COVID-19 restrictions next month if active cases and hospitalizations continue to fall, based on new projections.   Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made the announcement Friday morning, after the release of statistics showing B.C. has so far succeeded in reducing the number of cases and avoided overwhelming the health-care system. \"We have flattened that curve,\ " Henry said. Activities that could return in a few weeks include elective surgeries. Other changes would help reactivate sectors of the economy that aren't contingent on large gatherings of people. Some activities in schools could resume, but no decision has been made on whether that will happen before the end of the academic year.   \"I believe this summer, we will have the opportunity to have way more social opportunities … but we're not quite there yet. So I'm asking for patience,\ " Henry said.    However, Henry cautioned that significant restrictions would still be in place for some time — likely until a vaccine has been developed for the virus — and that B.C.'s continued success in avoiding a large outbreak would continue to rely on public health measures rather than developing herd immunity.   \"We are going to develop an evidence-based and thoughtful plan for our way forward,\ " Henry said. \"It is essential for everyone in B.C. to maintain what we have been doing … [but] it is perhaps, maybe, the end of the beginning.\" New modelling Originally, B.C. relied on comparisons with Italy, South Korea and China's Hubei province to develop models of what worst-case scenarios for hospitalizations could look like. However, the province says it will no longer rely on comparisons with Italy and Hubei.    \"B.C.'s cases have begun to plateau,\" Health Minister Adrian Dix said. \"We have cautious optimism about a downward trend, but only cautious optimism.\" COVID-19 in British Columbia by the numbersGet the latest news on COVID-19 in B.C. with our daily roundup Henry said the province is developing two new models to help with decision-making — one predicting new cases in the short term, assuming no change in current measures; and one simulating what could happen if levels of physical distancing change.   Using data collected in a partnership between the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and Google Mobility Reports, the province estimates current contacts between British Columbians are around 30 per cent of normal. They currently estimate that COVID-19 hospitalizations could remain relatively stable if B.C. went to between 40 and 60 per cent of regular contacts — but anything more would likely result in a new outbreak.    Preparing for the fall Health officials also are concerned about the virus returning in the fall, and have begun ordering more ventilators and adding to its number of acute care spaces as a precautionary measure.   Much like the province's first release of modelling information three weeks ago, officials did not release projections for the number of deaths in B.C. Henry has argued that would not be \"useful\" to officials' planning. Dix said finding a balance where British Columbians could resume some activities while containing the virus would be a huge task for officials in the weeks ahead.   B.C. could be reaching the 'maintenance phase' of its COVID-19 pandemic. Here's what that means \"We must find a healthy way forward for the next 12 to 18 months … a healthy new normal that sustains us and keeps us safe,\ " he said.    \"We need to find a way forward that allows us to socialize. Whatever actions we take, we know there's a significant human cost if we get it wrong.

  Alberta talk radio host and former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith is being criticized for promoting an article claiming there is a 100 per cent cure for coronavirus on Twitter. There is no known cure or targeted treatment for coronavirus and research is ongoing. \"BREAKING: New controlled clinical study conducted by doctors in France shows that hydroxychloroquine cures 100 per cent of coronavirus patients within six days of treatment,\ " she wrote on Saturday, with a link to a blog that reports on technology startups.  That tweet was deleted after it received a flood of criticism.

As the pandemic unfolds, I have many experts on the air to discuss potential treatment options,\ " she said. Radio host Danielle Smith has apologized and deleted a tweet that claimed a cure has been found for coronavirus but has left up other tweets making similar, unproven claims. (Danielle Smith/Twitter) The blog post in Smith's tweet references a French study of 26 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Six patients dropped out of the non-randomized study — one died, one developed nausea, three were transferred to intensive care, and one left — and of those who remained, they were tested for COVID-19 under a more relaxed definition than that used by most health authorities.   If there really was something that worked and it was clear and the evidence supported it, I promise you we would know​​​​.- Timothy Caulfield The study gained prominence after being touted by U.S. President Donald Trump, but was largely denounced by doctors including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying while potentially promising the science is largely anecdotal.   Other doctors have cautioned that the combination of drugs could be harmful if taken without proper medical supervision, and The Washington Post reported those touting the unproven cure have caused shortages of the drugs which are needed to treat lupus and arthritis patients.   Smith also shared a link to another blog, which primarily publishes anti-climate science writing, suggesting the same drugs and tonic water could be effective against coronavirus. She also tweeted that she would be doing her part in stopping COVID-19, as per President Trump's comments on anti-malarials, by drinking tonic water. One of those two tweets was deleted later Sunday, after this article was originally published. The other tweet has not been deleted. Global News said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, two days after this article was published, that it took action in response to Smith's tweet. \"Global News took immediate action when the tweet from our talk radio personality came to our attention. We do not support posting information that does not come from credible sources and remain steadfast in our commitment to being a responsible, trustworthy source for all Canadians,\" an emailed statement read. ' We need to be really careful' Timothy Caulfield, a Canada Research Chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta who focuses on debunking pseudoscience and unproven health advice, said Smith's tweets are disappointing. \"It really misses all the really crucial context and with a situation like this where there's so much uncertainty, so much fear, I think we need to be really careful how we represent the science,\ " he said. Caulfield said it's important to think of the multiple consequences that can stem from misinformation, like shortages of resources and that if we are going to talk about possible cures, media personalities do so in a careful way. \"I do think that if the public is hungry for information about the ongoing research, let's talk about it … the science has to be good. It has to be proven safe. So I think we need to represent the science in as accurate a manner as possible. We can still make science stories engaging, but let's make sure they're accurate,\ " he said.   Calgary clinic 'leveraging fear' with claim supplement helps prevent COVID-19, health expert says Clinic apologizes for claiming its supplement could prevent or treat COVID-19 Caulfield reminded people that it's important to look to trusted sources like the World Health Organization for information. \"There are no magical preventative steps beyond what we already know, wash your hands, social distancing. Those are the things that are really going to have an impact,\ " he said. \"If there really was something that worked and it was clear and the evidence supported it , I promise you we would know and we would hear about it from those respected voices.\" Smith's coronavirus comments are not the first time the former politician has been criticized for making an unproven health claim on Twitter. In 2012, the then Opposition leader tweeted that thorough cooking can kill E. coli bacteria, suggesting tainted meat could be fed to those in need, as the province was in the midst of a massive beef recall due to E. coli contamination. Research has shown that some E. coli bacteria can survive past the recommended temperatures for cooking meat.   There are more than 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada.

  A return to normal life may still be a long way off for B.C. and it will depend on people staying at home, washing their hands and maintaining physical distances, according to the provincial health officer. Dr. Bonnie Henry said Wednesday that while B.C. has managed to hold COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations to manageable levels, \"we are not at the end of our beginning yet.\ " She said she doesn't foresee any lifting of the restrictions on daily life within the next two weeks or even three weeks. \"Normal is going to look quite different for some time,\ " Henry said. \"There are some measures that we are not going to be able to stop doing until we have enough immunity in our community ... to prevent transmission and to prevent a lot of people from becoming sick in a short time.\ " That immunity can only come one of two ways — through infection or through development of a vaccine. Until then, physical distancing and frequent handwashing will remain the norm. B.C. extends state of emergency for another 2 weeks Henry said she doesn't foresee any changes to how British Columbians go grocery shopping or visit the pharmacy in the near future. \"It's important for us to be patient and to be kind to each other. It is going to be some weeks before we can let up even a little bit,\ " she said. ' So many people have sacrificed so much' But planning is underway for how certain restrictions could be loosened, beginning with things like restarting certain parts of the health-care system that have been put on hold and reopening some businesses that can operate with safe distances between people. Henry said any major changes will depend on things like ensuring there's enough personal protective equipment for health-care workers and enough capacity in the health-care system. It will also mean implementing broader COVID-19 testing in the community, and potentially bringing in serological testing to determine who has developed immunity through infection. Despite COVID-19, 'it is safe to go to the hospital,' B.C.'s top doctor says Health Minister Adrian Dix emphasized that the only way B.C. can begin opening up again is if the curve of infection is truly flattened. \"When so many people have sacrificed so much, sometimes by choice, sometimes not by choice, we really have to be 100 per cent all in now,\" he said.

  An old ebola drug being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 is capable of tricking the virus responsible for the deadly respiratory disease, a new University of Alberta study suggests.   The drug remdesivir is capable of halting the coronavirus from replicating, according to new research published Monday in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The study, led by Matthias Götte, chair of medical microbiology and immunology at U of A, demonstrates how the antiviral drug disrupts the virus by attacking enzymes known as polymerases. When viruses infect our body, they hijack our cells to replicate themselves, making more viruses that can go on to infect other cells or people, Götte said in a news release Monday. Remdesivir takes advantage of the coronavirus' natural life cycle, infiltrating the virus' genome and effectively shutting down its ability to make copies of itself, he said.   Replication of the virus relies on the polymerases, enzymes which synthesize the virus' genome by assembling sequences of RNA molecules. Remdesivir inhibits this process by masquerading as a part of the virus itself and damaging it from the inside, Götte said.     The drug has proven a \"very potent inhibitor,\" he said.   \"If you target the polymerase, the virus cannot spread, so it's a very logical target for treatment,\ " Götte said. \"These coronavirus polymerases are sloppy and they get fooled, so the inhibitor gets incorporated many times and the virus can no longer replicate.\"  ' A very potent inhibitor' The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies involving hundreds of patients around the globe began in early March. And while the study supports the need for clinical study, results obtained in the lab cannot predict how the drug will work on people, Götte said.   Ongoing clinical trials will be the true test, Götte said. Those results can be expected as early as April or May. American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences developed the drug remdesivir as a response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed the drug was not particularly effective against Ebola, but testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. A previous study by Götte and his team, published in February, demonstrated that the drug was effective against MERS, a related coronavirus. \"We were optimistic that we would see the same results against the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" Götte said.  SARS-CoV-2 virus is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \"We obtained almost identical results as we reported previously with MERS, so we see that remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor for coronavirus polymerases.\ " Last month, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will assess patients across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers. Götte is optimistic the ongoing global effort to find effective treatments for COVID-19 will be successful. \"We are desperate, but we still have to keep the bar high for anything that we put into clinical trials,\" Götte said.   Treating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon
  Canada's top doctor says there isn't enough evidence to back herd immunity as a way to reopen society, as Quebec's premier is considering the approach to restart his province's economy. \"The idea of ... generating natural immunity is actually not something that should be undertaken,\ " Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said Saturday, urging people to be \"extremely cautious\" about the concept. Herd immunity is conferred when enough people in a given population have been infected with a virus, marking them immune to reinfection and slowing down the rate at which the virus spreads on its own.   The World Health Organization (WHO) published a brief Friday stating that there is \"currently no evidence\" that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies would be protected from a second infection, but clarified Saturday that most people infected would end up with \"some level of protection.\" Earlier today we tweeted about a new WHO scientific brief on \"immunity passports\". The thread caused some concern &amp; we would like to clarify:<br><br> We expect that most people who are infected with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection. <a href=\"https://t.co/AmxvQQLTjM\">pic.twitter.com/AmxvQQLTjM</a>&mdash;@WHO Tam's comments come as Quebec Premier François Legault expressed interest in herd immunity this week as a means to reopen businesses and allow children to return to school. \"The idea is to gradually — and that's the important word — to gradually let people go out, let children go out,\ " he said Thursday, adding that those under 60 years of age might be candidates for developing immunity. Will herd immunity save us? Your COVID-19 questions answeredAs Quebec considers reopening schools, this is what experts say about herd immunity Tam rejected the suggestion that in the absence of a vaccine, some members of Canada's population could offer protection to society's most vulnerable. \"Even a young person might get severely sick or get into the ICU, so it's not a concept that should be supported,\ " she said.   In response to Tam's remarks, Premier Legault's office said the province plans to forge ahead with easing lockdown restrictions, but only with the approval of Quebec's public health department. ' More caution' Legault is not alone in searching for solutions to reopen his province's economy, as nationwide shutdowns pass the one-month mark. On Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canada's premiers agreed to work on a joint set of national guidelines that would lay out how to carry out the process. First ministers agree to draft national guidelines on reopening economy The prime minister said Saturday that those plans do not rely on using immunity as an interim form of protection. \"In the approach that we're taking very carefully around the provinces and across the country on looking at reopening , I don't believe that there are any plans that hinge on certain people or individuals being immune or having immunity to COVID-19,\ " Trudeau said.   The federal government has committed millions of dollars toward a new COVID-19 immunity task force focused on researching immunity testing and developing a vaccine — something Tam said is still in its early stages.    \"Until we have those answers, we need to... err on the side of more caution,\ " Trudeau said. WATCH |  Trudeau discusses joint guidelines for reopening the economy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed how Canada's provinces are working on a jointly-drafted set of guidelines to establish principles for reopening the country's economy. 0:42 'Immunology' of the virus not known Allowing people with protected immunity status back into society has captured international attention, with countries like Chile moving to issue \"immunity passports\" to those who have recovered from the virus. The passes have been touted as a way to gradually exempt people from restrictions put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19, permitting them to return to work, attend mass gatherings or even travel across borders. But Tam warned that research on whether immunity is possible — and how long it might last — remains murky. \"It is a very novel virus,\ " she said. \"We don't understand the immunology of this virus very much.\ " WHO cautioned in its brief that due to a lack of evidence, doling out passes based on recovery from the virus could lead to people ignoring public health advice when they could still get re-infected and continue the chain of transmission. WATCH | Dr. Tam says it's too early to think about immunity passports: Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said that without a clear understanding of immunity tests for COVID-19, it's too early to think about issuing passes for those who might be protected. 0:53 Passports may become necessary, doctor says For Dr. Kumanan Wilson, a physician at the Ottawa Hospital and innovation adviser at the Bruyère Research Institute, immunity passports will be key to returning to society if the science is there to support it.   Wilson is hoping to partner with the federal government to launch a digital identification system that shows who is protected from the virus should immunity tests become available. \"It is possible that the science doesn't demonstrate that you do develop long-lasting immunity, in which case [passports] would not be an appropriate way to proceed,\ " Wilson said. \"But if the science does demonstrate that this is a good solution, it will be important to have a technological solution in place.\" Wilson has proposed a system that would arm Canadians, or people around the world, with a digital record of their level of protection, which would be scanned to enter workplaces, sports stadiums and airports. LISTEN | Dr. Kumanan Wilson speaks to CBC Radio's The House about immunity passports: Ottawa physician Dr. Kumanan Wilson discusses the concept of immunity passports — and their repercussions — as a stepping stone to reopening the economy in the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine. 12:49 He acknowledged that classifying people based on protection status could lead to other concerns, such as some citizens having better access to immunity tests than others, or those compelled to falsify their status to re-enter society. But he said he's also conscious of the need for life to return to normal as quickly as possible.   \"We know that for every week, every day that we wait to get people out of social isolation, it's causing quite a bit of harm.\ "

Forty-four patients are currently being treated in intensive care.   Seventy-eight people have tested positive for the virus at Mission Institution, a federal prison. A total of 1,092 people have recovered from the disease. Horgan promises to investigate sick pay changes following poultry plant outbreak Outbreak at 2nd poultry plant Another poultry plant is seeing staff infected with the virus. Two positive tests were confirmed at the Superior Poultry Plant in Coquitlam, a sister plant of United Poultry Plant in East Vancouver, where 29 people have tested positive.   Some people working in both places, said Henry. She expects there will likely be others in the new facility that are ill and will test positive.   Investigations are ongoing at both facilities. Reboot B.C., not the virus While British Columbians are starting to think about how society might slowly open up if the province continues to flatten the curve of infection, Henry said everyone needs to be very careful about how that happens. \"How do we live with it without getting ourselves into trouble?\" she said.  \"A misstep in the wrong direction puts us all at risk.\" As Health Minister Adrian Dix put it: \"We need to reboot B.C. without rebooting the virus.\" Henry said while she would like to see no new cases for days and even weeks in a row, she recognizes the need to increase social and economic connections. But she was clear that won't happen unless there is \"a manageable number of new cases\" and appropriate measures in place to ensure the virus doesn't \"take off again.\ "  \"This is not forever. It is for now. Now may be months, it may be a year,\ " she said. \"Now is not the time to tip the scales against us with careless action.\" Applications for $1,000 benefit open May 1 The province on Thursday said applications for the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers will open May 1. It is the tax-free, one-time $1,000 payment announced in March for B.C. residents whose ability to work has been affected due to COVID-19. To be eligible, applicants must also meet the eligibility requirements for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, among other criteria.

  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  The UN health agency is warning that more than 117 million children in more than three dozen countries could miss out on measles vaccines as nations suspend immunizations and other services to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The World Health Organization says 24 countries have already postponed measles vaccination campaigns to avert further spread of COVID-19, and another 13 are expected to do so by the end of the year. \"If the difficult choice to pause vaccination is made due to the spread of COVID-19, we urge leaders to intensify efforts to track unvaccinated children so that the most vulnerable populations can be provided with measles vaccines as soon as it becomes possible to do so,\ " WHO said in a statement Tuesday. WHO and partners say they support a \"pause of mass campaigns\" in their measles and Rubella initiative to protect communities and health workers, but \"this should not mean that children permanently miss out.\"
  An Air Canada vice president suggests that by the time winter holidays roll around again, Canadians will be able to board his company's planes and fly almost anywhere in the world. But Tim Strauss said he knows that one of the biggest tasks involved in bringing air travel back to life after pandemic restrictions lift will be convincing the public it's safe to fly. \"I think by Christmas you will see a significant amount of flying again,\ " said Strauss, vice president of cargo at Air Canada. \"We'll be flying to most places around the world and certainly domestically.\" There may be fewer flights available and more connections than travellers are used to, he added. The airline industry has been hammered by the pandemic. Some Canadian airlines have stopped flying entirely while others, including Air Canada, have scaled back more than 90 per cent due to the dramatic drop in demand.   At a virtual Canadian Club Toronto event today, executives at several major airlines talked about what the North American airline industry could look like post-pandemic. Air Canada, Sunwing and American Airlines said corporate conversations about post-pandemic operations are focused on making sure planes are kept clean. Some airlines are changing how often they sanitize their planes and are even considering changes to how air is circulated in passenger cabins. ' We are rolling out completely new procedures' \"That is the absolute centre focus of almost all of our product discussions at this point,\ " said Strauss, regarding cleanliness. \"The whole industry will be working in tandem with one another to make sure it's good no matter what airplane you're on, anywhere in the world.\" American Airlines said that, as it learned more about COVID-19 over the past two months, it overhauled its cleaning process and now considers it a key part of ensuring a plane is safe to fly. \"We're rolling out completely new procedures that are disinfecting all parts of the aircraft that a customer touches before every flight,\" said Jim Butler, senior vice president of airport operations and cargo at American Airlines. \"Before this, while that disinfection happened, it tended to happen more overnight.\" His airline is boosting its cleaning staff while looking for ways to make boarding more efficient, so that flights aren't delayed by cleaning. The airline also has been handing out personal protective equipment to all its customers and limiting the number of people onboard by blocking off the centre seats. Butler said the most difficult part will be educating the public about the measures being taken. People check in at an Air Canada ticketing kiosk at Pearson International Airport. Transport Canada has made it mandatory for travellers to wear masks on planes and in airports when physical distancing isn't possible. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) ' We're modelling so many different scenarios right now' \"You have to make sure the customer is safe and ... that they feel safe. Both of those are equally important,\ " he said.   In Canada, Transport Canada has made it mandatory for all passengers to wear masks while onboard and in airports when they cannot physically distance two metres from others. Sunwing's president Mark Williams said the industry doesn't know how soon the pandemic might end, or how quickly customers might come back. \"We're modelling so many different scenarios right now because we don't know what the future holds,\ " he said.   Williams said that when the industry revives, it will have to convince Canadians that all aspects of air travel are safe — including getting to the airport, checking in and going through security screening. \"People have to be aware of the safety,\" said Williams. \"I'm not sure that leaving an empty seat between two people on an airplane is really going to have a significant impact on how safe you are onboard a plane from getting a virus.   \"I think there's other steps that we need to take. People need to understand what they are and what the risks are, to get them back to flying.\ " No point in travelling unless countries are open for business Air Canada also is looking at how air is circulated onboard its planes. \"That's one of the things we need to adjust to make the flight safer,\" said Strauss.   The World Health Organization cites research showing there's very little risk of communicable diseases being shared in-flight through a plane's ventilation system. The plane's cabins use filters which trap virus particles, according to the WHO's website. While Air Canada predicts better times for the industry by Christmas, Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen and Company, points out that other countries will need to lift their pandemic restrictions and reopen their economies first, in order to convince people to travel. \"You can't go to London and quarantine for 14 days,\" said Becker. \"If your vacation was going to be a long weekend and you go , it doesn't work. \"We need to get all these governments on the same page to kind of open things up. Everyone wants it to be done safely because no one wants the recurrence of cases.\ " Strauss said there are signs the economy is about to turn around. Manufacturers are moving parts around the world on Air Canada's cargo flights, he said, and his company is getting ready to transport retail goods from clothing manufacturers to North America. \"These are companies that only make these moves when they think there's an economy coming back,\ " she said. \"That makes me very optimistic, that we are at the beginning steps of a rebound.\"
  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation. 
  Scientists around the world are racing to find novel ways to treat, mitigate or prevent infection from the novel coronavirus. The response has been especially rapid as the virus has spread unchecked across the globe. Still, any treatments are a long way from being proven both effective and safe, and most certainly won't come in time to address the current pandemic. According to some of the top infectious disease experts in the world, even on an accelerated timeline, a vaccine is still likely 12 to 18 months away — and then the challenge will be producing enough to make it readily available. There is currently no drug therapy or vaccine approved anywhere in the world for COVID-19. Here are the latest developments in the research. Old drugs, new tricks May 1: Health Canada announces it has authorized the CONCOR-1 clinical study that will involve soliciting donations of blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients across the country to see if their antibodies can help treat people who are sick. April 15: Japan's Fujifilm announces it is ramping up production of Avigan (favipiravir), a drug approved in 2014 to treat influenza that doesn't respond to other drugs. It's produced and distributed at the discretion of the Japanese government and has never been commercially available anywhere in the world. The drug is in Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan, and in other trials in the U.S., Italy and China. April 9: The University of British Columbia announces that patient enrolment is underway for the Canadian arm of the World Health Organization's global SOLIDARITY trial, called CATCO (Canadian Trials for COVID). Patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 at one of 20 participating hospitals in Canada will be eligible for the trial, which will start by evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir, a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, compared with \"optimized supportive care.\" It will later add two other medications for investigation — the antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria. Made-in-Canada quick, portable COVID-19 test kits approved for use April 3: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announces an \"expanded access\" program to facilitate wider study of convalescent plasma  —  that is, injecting the antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered into patients who are sick — as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. The Mayo Clinic is named lead site to co-ordinate the program among dozens of doctors and scientists who initially self-organized to conduct such research. April 2: Canadian Blood Services (CBS) says it is working with researchers to design a large, national clinical trial on treating the novel coronavirus with convalescent plasma.  Pending Health Canada approval, CBS and Héma-Québec will be responsible for supplying the convalescent plasma to hospitals across the country. WATCH |  Dr. Dana Devine explains how 'convalescent plasma' will be collected and used:   \"We think it's most likely to be effective is when you have a patient who is clearly sick with the virus but whose own immune system hasn't had a chance to make antibodies yet,\ " CBS chief scientist Dr. Dana Devine told CBC Radio's Quirks & Quarks.   Convalescent plasma has been used in a small number of COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began, but not in a study comparing those who receive the therapy with those who don't.   March 26: University of Manitoba researchers begin recruiting participants for a series of trials to test whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can reduce the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 and slow its spread. The trial, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta and McGill University Health Centre, will include participants who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who live with someone who has. Long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, but Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said the short, five-day trial should be \"very safe.\"   Manitoba researchers begin clinical trial with drug they hope can help in COVID-19 fight   \"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the health care system.\ " But experts, including Canada's chief public health officer, warn that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side-effects.  They also say there is a danger that hoarding the medication could hurt the many patients who take it for chronic inflammatory diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.   Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19  March 25: New York's Mount Sinai hospital begins treating critically ill COVID-19 patients via plasmapheresis, a century-old therapy that involves removing antibody-rich plasma from blood and returning it to a patient (the same or another) after either treating it or replacing it. In this case, doctors will transfer antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients into sick ones in the hopes the antibodies will neutralize the disease. .<a href=\"https://twitter.com /MountSinaiNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MountSinaiNYC</a> to begin the transfer of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> antibodies into critically ill patients: <a href=\"https://t.co /bpSB2HuSqR\">https://t.co/ bpSB2HuSqR</a > <a href=\"https://t.co /GpEHoHEEM6\">pic.twitter.com/ GpEHoHEEM6</a>&mdash;@IcahnMountSinai March 24 : The Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton announces a study beginning in April to compare therapy using a combination of the antibiotic azithromycin with malaria drug chloroquine versus the usual \"standard of care\" in COVID-19 patients. The trial will involve some 1,500 participants  —  a mix of patients who have been hospitalized for the virus and others in the community who have tested positive for it. March 23: Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute say they are recruiting up to 6,000 Quebecers over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus to study whether colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat gout, Behçet's disease and familial Mediterranean fever, is effective in treating respiratory complications of COVID-19, like lung inflammation, before patients need ventilators or die. Quebecers who meet the criteria and wish to take part in the study at the Montreal Heart Institute can find out more from their doctor or by calling 1-877-536-6837. (Montreal Heart Institute) \"It's inexpensive , it's widely available and the reason why we think it might very well work is that it's a powerful anti-inflammatory agent,\"  Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, the institute's research director, said in an interview with CBC Montreal's Daybreak.   Montreal Heart Institute launches clinical study into colchicine as potential COVID-19 treatment  March 18: The World Health Organization announces the SOLIDARITY trial, a co-ordinated international study into potential treatments for COVID-19 that will test and compare four different drugs or combinations of drugs either developed or already licensed for use to treat other illnesses: remdesivir, an antiviral; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; interferon beta-1a, used to treat multiple sclerosis, with lopinavir and ritonavir; and anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Canada is among the countries participating. March 11: The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic.   March 6: Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, begins two Phase 3 trials of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola: one in patients with \"severe disease\" and another in patients with \"moderate disease.\" The studies will be conducted in the U.S., U.K., Italy, Hong Kong, Spain and a number of other countries.   List of COVID-19 clinical trials authorized by Health Canada  Feb. 21: The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initiates a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir, which is believed to operate by stopping the virus from replicating. Remdesivir is an investigational drug, meaning it's not currently approved anywhere to treat any condition. It was developed to treat Ebola but was ultimately unsuccessful. Participants in this trial will be COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia.   Immunizing the herd April 30: There are eight vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, and 94 in preclinical evaluation. April 21: U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces that a vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University will begin human trials on April 23. He said the British government was providing £20 million to the Oxford team to help fund their clinical trials, and a further £22.5 million to researchers at Imperial College London, who are working on another potential vaccine that they have been testing in animals.

  Albertans who have been exposed to the coronavirus are being asked to join a clinical trial into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-viral drug that's been used for decades to treat malaria and some auto-immune diseases. It's one of the drugs that U.S. President Donald Trump has touted as a \"game changer.\" Albertans who have been exposed to COVID-19 will form one part of the study, while those who have tested positive for the disease are being asked to join a separate trial.   Researchers are hoping to recruit as many as 600 people across the province. \"For now, this is going to be for people living with somebody who's known to be COVID positive or somebody who's a health-care worker that's been looking after someone who's known to be positive,\" said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an associate professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta's faculty of medicine.   The study is being led by McGill University with participants from Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta expected to include as many as 1,500 people from Canada. Another 1,500 people are enrolled in a similar study in the United States.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 8   McGill team seeks Quebecers exposed to COVID-19 for hydroxychloroquine study    At a time of physical distancing, participants will have no contact with medical researchers conducting the study. It means that more Albertans who live outside Calgary and Edmonton and away from the province's major universities will be able to participate. Anyone who's been exposed to the virus is being asked to visit COVID-19research.ca to see if they qualify for the study. If accepted, they'll receive a five-day course of either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo. \"We're going to be giving medication to people after they've been exposed and possibly infected to see if we can prevent that infection from taking hold,\" said Schwartz. \"No medication has proven to be effective in either preventing or treating COVID-19. And that's why we need to do these studies.\ " Evidence lacking  The head of the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious disease at the University of Calgary's Cumming school of medicine says the results from three, small studies into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 have been mixed. Two studies showed positive results, while the third was negative.   Dr. Chris Mody says the three trials involved a total of 120 patients and their outcomes following a six-day course of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Watch | Be wary of online information claiming to 'cure' COVID-19: Misinformation about so-called miracle cures for COVID-19 are spreading online. Can you really buy your way to a better immune system? We ask an expert: UBC professor Bernie Garrett, who studies deception in healthcare, including alternative medicine. 5:27 One of the trials showed virtually no difference between those who took the drug and those who didn't. Another trial showed more people who took HCQ recovered from pneumonia compared with those who received the usual care. The third trial showed more people who didn't take HCQ converted from a positive test for COVID-19 to a negative one.   \"I wouldn't say on the basis of that number of patients and two trials that look positive and one that looks negative, that we should be using hydroxychloroquine as the standard of care,\" said Mody. \"I would describe the evidence for hydroxychloroquine is that it indicates it should be studied further. That's about as far as I would go with the evidence there.\" Controversy, warnings, hoarding HCQ has received a lot of attention since President Trump touted it as a \"game changer\" in a tweet last month. He suggested hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin, an anti-biotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia, would change the world of medicine. Since the March 21 tweet, a number of people have expressed enthusiasm for the still-unproven claims.   Alberta talk radio host Danielle Smith apologized and deleted a tweet that claimed HCQ cured 100 per cent of coronavirus patients within six days of treatment.    Talk radio host deletes tweet with false claim that there's a 100% cure for coronavirus   Kathy Macdonald, a University of Calgary senator, said in a recent tweet that HCQ is \"the most effective drug!\" while retweeting an article that suggested physicians shared the same view.   University of Calgary senator Kathy MacDonald retweeted an apparent survey of physicians who praised an unproven therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The tweet has since been deleted.   (Twitter) The University of Calgary distanced itself from Macdonald's tweet. \"The University of Calgary is committed to developing solutions that are evidence-based and backed by scientific rigour. The views expressed were posted on a personal social media account and do not reflect those of the University of Calgary.  We encourage Albertans to look to Alberta Health Services for guidance on best practices in the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation. In a separate tweet, Macdonald questioned why the Alberta government has such a narrow view on potential remedies. Both tweets have since been deleted. Kathy MacDonald has since deleted a tweet that questioned the Alberta government's 'narrow view of potential remedies' for COVID-19. (Twitter) In a statement to the CBC, Alberta Health said in part: \"While different research projects are underway to assess the effectiveness of various therapies, there is no robust evidence yet on any treatment. We are closely monitoring the emerging evidence across Canada and around the world. If that changes, we will alert Albertans and take action accordingly.\ "  However, the ministry acknowledged that more information regarding research studies will be made available as early as this week. \"We know that many Albertan physicians are interested in enrolling patients in research studies underway on experimental therapies,\ " it said in a statement.  \"We will be sending information out in the coming days so physicians who want their patients to have access to these therapies can put them in touch with the appropriate people.\ " There's also been concern about the supply of HCQ since it's been touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada   The governing bodies for Alberta's physicians and pharmacists issued a joint warning about prescribing behaviours, misuse and stockpiling of the drugs. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and the Alberta College of Pharmacy said there are \"serious concerns about shortages\" that could affect patients with chronic conditions who rely on the drugs.   Schwartz says all of the headlines around HCQ and some of the other drugs is a concern, and that it's important for the research to get underway to safely monitor patients who qualify for the trials. \"We want to avoid people taking this medication until it is proven to be both safe and effective for this purpose,\ " he said. Health Canada says so far eight clinical trials have been approved.   Schwartz says just as fast as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, they're hoping to get preliminary results from their trials in a matter of weeks.    Bryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

  With shortages of masks, gloves and testing kits hampering the fight against the coronavirus in Canada, there is one important weapon that remains unused — rapid blood tests that will tell within 15 minutes if someone has been exposed. These tests cannot detect early infections because the body's immune system hasn't had time to produce antibodies against the virus.  But about five to seven days after symptoms show up, they could be used to determine who has been infected and who has not — which would provide a more accurate picture of Canada's epidemic, including identifying people who were asymptomatic or had only mild infections. The rapid blood tests are already being used in Europe, Asia, Australia and the U.S. Some academic laboratories are also developing COVID blood tests. But so far none of those tests has been approved for use in Canada. One company, BTNX Inc., in Markham, Ont., is shipping thousands of rapid tests to hospitals in the U.S.    INTERACTIVE  | Tracking the number of coronavirus cases in Canada   Mitchell Pittaway, the company's chief financial officer, said he would rather be distributing the tests in Canada. \"The response [from Health Canada] has been a bit longer than what we would have liked to have seen,\ " Pittaway said. \"The U.S. has been much quicker.\ " Similar to blood glucose test This week his company shipped 20,000 tests to U.S. hospitals. It will be sending another 200,000 to the U.S. next week. \"As a Canadian company with Canadian staff, ideally we would love to have all of this capacity blocked off for Canada, but we're not able to step back and not address needs coming from other countries.\" BTNX Inc., in Markham, Ont. , is one of several companies awaiting approval of rapid blood testing technology in Canada. Meanwhile, BTNX is shipping thousands of its tests to hospitals in the U.S., where approval was fast-tracked. (BTNX Inc.) The test kit sells for about $10 US and it uses a simple finger-prick of blood to reveal whether someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"It's similar to a blood glucose test,\" said Pittaway. \"Put a droplet of blood in the sample well, followed by two droplets of buffer, and after 15 minutes there will be a reaction.\ " That's if the person has been infected with COVID-19. There will be no red lines on the test paper if there are no antibodies detected in the blood. What is a ventilator and who gets one if COVID-19 turns catastrophic in Canada? The company reports that the test is highly sensitive and specific for the COVID-19 virus, but does not recommend it as stand-alone confirmation of an infection, and the test can be complicated if a person has been infected by milder coronavirus strains. Still, Pittaway said the test could help reduce the current strain on the laboratory testing system by prioritizing anyone who gets a positive result on the blood test. Health Canada reviewing There is a risk of false positives and false negatives with any test. That's one reason Health Canada is taking a close look at the rapid blood tests before approving them for use in Canada \"The department is working with the National Microbiology Laboratory to validate testing and research, along with expert advice, so that we can have confidence in the test results,\ " Health Canada spokesperson Geoffroy Legault-Thivierge said in an email. CBC ExplainsWhat you need to know about the new COVID-19 emergency wage subsidy In the U.S., the FDA is is allowing the test kits to be sold for use by health care professionals only. \"And that's the same as we're pursuing in Canada,\" said Pittaway There are more than a dozen companies ready with blood tests and waiting for Health Canada to give them the go-ahead. \"Our application to Health Canada was submitted and under review,\" Bryan Fang, a spokesperson for Healgen Scientific said in an email. \"Health Canada will release the information once it is approved.\" An illustration of Healgen Scientific's rapid COVID-19 blood test, which has been approved for use in the U.K., France and Italy, and is awaiting approval in Canada. (Healgen Scientific) Fang said his company received European approval back in February to supply a rapid COVID-19 test to the U.K., France and Italy.   \"We are increasing our capacity every day,\ " Fang said Wednesday. \"As of today, we can make 500-600K per day.\ " Swab test kits prioritized Two weeks ago, Canada's health minister signed an interim order to speed up approvals for COVID-19 tests and other medical devices. Rapid blood tests are being considered under that order \"These tests are also being accepted for review; however, the World Health Organization does not currently recommend serological tests for clinical diagnosis, and Health Canada is following this advice,\" said Legault-Thivierge, adding that Health Canada officials are giving the traditional PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing kits priority under the interim order. The laboratory-based PCR test, like the one pictured, is the only one that can detect an infection in the early stages, using a nasal swab inserted into a patient's nose. (Evan Tsuyoshi Mitsui/CBC) The laboratory-based PCR test is the only one that can detect an infection in the early stages, using a nasal swab inserted into a patient's nose. That sample is sent to a hospital or provincial lab, where specialized machines try to detect the virus's genetic material. But a cross-Canada shortage of testing kits, machines and trained laboratory staff means many COVID-19 cases are being missed, and provincial case counts are underestimating the extent of the epidemic in Canada. People are still shocked to learn that they might not be tested despite having symptoms or being in close contact with someone who is infected. Even in nursing homes with active COVID-19 outbreaks, Ontario is still only testing people with symptoms. CBC InvestigatesChiropractors chided for claims of boosting immunity and preventing COVID-19   Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Toronto's Sinai Health Systems, told CBC Toronto's Mike Crawley that everyone in an affected long-term care facility should be tested. \"That's important so that we don't miss cases that could allow us to further spread this virus around and potentially kill more people,\ " he said. Across Canada, researchers are scrambling to increase PCR testing capacity. At the University of Toronto, Keith Pardee is developing a portable test system that uses different chemicals than the ones currently running short. His test is not yet approved for use, but he hopes to have patient trials completed by early next month. At the University of Calgary, Dr. Dylan Pillai is developing another alternative to the PCR test that would also be portable and use different chemicals. He said he could be ready within two weeks to help take the load off the laboratories. \"We have a working assay already developed and we're just in the process of validating that,\ " he said. With new research suggesting there could be a substantial number of people infected without showing any symptoms, experts are increasingly recommending the use of population-wide rapid blood tests as an important tool in the process of returning to normal. The blood tests will reveal how many people have already been exposed, and could therefore be expected to have at least some short-term immunity to the virus. 
  Manitobans worried about coronavirus should not panic and don't need to stockpile food, the province's health minister says. Cameron Friesen is instead asking Manitobans to take basic precautions to prevent the spread of the illness, such as washing their hands and staying home when sick.   But he does suggest people have a healthy supply of personal medicine, just in case. \"It's never a bad idea to make sure that you've got medications that you need and that you're not running short of basic medications that have been prescribed to you,\" Friesen said at a news conference Tuesday.   \"Beyond that , I think Manitobans can rely on the fact that their government and Public Health will keep them in the know.\ " The province has yet to record any confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 90,000 people worldwide and resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000 people.   Questioning stockpiling food There are now 30 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, confirmed in Canada. Friesen, however, cautioned against fear-mongering, as the risk of contracting the illness remains low in Manitoba and Canada. In a conversation with Patty Hajdu, his federal counterpart, Friesen says he took exception to Hajdu's advice last week that Canadians should prepare for possible illness as they would for a natural emergency such as severe weather — by stocking up with about a week's worth of food, medicine and other basic supplies.   \"I just questioned the extent to which, at this point in time, such an instruction would be helpful. I believe she agreed that we need to co-ordinate our statements,\ " he said. Health ministers want \"to be able to speak with one voice, because I think that consistency matters.\" WATCH | Ian Froese's report: Health Minister Cameron Friesen cautions against federal advice to stock up on week's worth of food, medicine. 2:07 He wouldn't speculate whether Manitobans should take measures to prepare for isolation.  The Canadian Red Cross, for example, recommends Canadians prepare a small 72-hour emergency kit. Stores in the province are facing shortages of facial masks and hand sanitizers, Friesen said. The World Health Organization says the hoarding of masks, gloves and gowns is leaving health-care workers ill-prepared to care for patients — and it's putting lives at risk. \"Without secure supply chains, the risk to health-care workers around the world is real,\"  WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday.   \"Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can't stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first.\ " Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices for surgical masks have surged, Ghebreyesus said, adding supplies can take months to deliver and are frequently sold to the highest bidder. The WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 47 countries, but supplies are rapidly depleting. So even in places like Manitoba, where there have been no confirmed cases yet of COVID-19, politicians and others are warning against unnecessary stockpiling of medical equipment. Health Minister Cameron Friesen says the province is prepared for the arrival of coronavirus, if it happens.   (Ian Froese/CBC)      \"Health-care workers at the front line, not only globally but even here in Winnipeg, rely on those for infection control and that's not just for coronavirus — that's for any number of things,\" said Jason Kindrachuk, the Canada Research Chair in infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba. \"Yes, we can have supplies at home, but those types of things are definitely not going to have a recognizable impact in transmission in the community. In hospitals is where they're needed.\ " Kindrachuk is leaving Wednesday for two weeks in the Marshall Islands, a sovereign state north of Australia that is associated with the United States, where he will be working with a WHO-funded non-governmental organization to help the country prepare for cases of coronavirus. \"Because it's U.S. territory, there is a direct link back to the mainland, so I think there is some concern that this potentially could be essentially a jumping off point for more cases to be able to come into North America,\" he said. Jason Kindrachuk does basic science research on infectious diseases like flu, Zika, Ebola and now coronavirus, looking at how a virus jumps from animals to humans and also treatments/vaccines. He is Canada Research Chair in infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba and also works at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. He is going to Marshall Islands Mar. 4 with an NGO funded by the World Health Organization to help with emergency preparedness. (Jaison Empson/CBC) Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Friesen said the Manitoba government is deploying \"extraordinary resources\" to prepare the province for the arrival of the virus  — if it comes. The health minister is participating in a daily briefing with the chief provincial public health officer and held a conference call with municipal officials on Monday.   Hospitals have a number of protocols in place, depending on the threat, Friesen said. He wasn't specific about those plans, but said they range from how testing is done to appropriate staffing levels. International travellers should self-monitor for coronavirus symptoms: Manitoba chief public health officerSick woman at Winnipeg airport 'not a coronavirus case,' Premier Brian Pallister says \"We know there's no instance here in Manitoba, so that planning continues and that planning goes to a granular level of what this would look like in hospitals if we had a certain amount of our population that was affected.\ " The health minister wouldn't say whether there is a strategy to deal with a quarantine.   \"I won't get too far into detail, but I'd say the planning at this point is significant.\"  
  A Dalhousie University researcher at the forefront of Canada's quest to find a treatment for COVID-19 says human trials for a new vaccine could be only weeks away. Dalhousie's COVID-19 rapid response team is moving forward with testing a vaccine that uses a genome of DNA from SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. \"We're beginning to evaluate this in animal models and we can even bring this into people for Phase 1 clinical trials as soon as three weeks from now,\ " virologist Alyson Kelvin told CBC's Information Morning on Wednesday. \"Right now, DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in people, so we hope that this will help expedite the process of vaccine development.\" How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine But Kelvin, an assistant professor in Dalhousie's department of microbiology and immunology, also cautioned that it typically takes a year for vaccines to be developed, tested and distributed to the general public. Alyson Kelvin is working with three vaccines developed by a Halifax molecular virologist and a vaccine developed by a scientist at the centre. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press) \"We're working as hard as we can to move this as fast as possible,\ " she said. \"We have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this isn't the best vaccine that we can put forth.\ " There are now 68 cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, which has been under a state of emergency since Sunday. Halifax father-daughter duo researching 'rapid response' tests, vaccines to combat COVID-19 Unlike a typical flu vaccine that's created using protein from a virus, Kelvin said the vaccine her team is testing uses a piece of the virus's DNA. \"And it uses your own cells to produce protein that will teach your immune system what the virus looks like,\ " she said.   Kelvin said the DNA vaccine was developed by her colleague, Roy Duncan, and is one of three types of vaccines the team is evaluating right now.   How long will it take? Kelvin said SARS CoV-2 is a good candidate for a vaccine because coronaviruses don't mutate as quickly as the influenza virus does.   The virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its DNA when it replicates and infects a host, she said.   \"Which means that the virus and its proteins are a bit more stable so we can target it better.\" VIDO-InterVac, the Saskatoon-based lab where Kelvin is working as a visiting professor, began researching a vaccine in January, and just received $23 million from the federal government to keep doing that work.   But even with an influx of funding, and with scientists around the world working feverishly, vaccine development can be a long and complicated process. Kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time COVID-19 returns. \"There's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus. If this is the case, we'll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back,\ " Kelvin said.   In the meantime, stay home As researchers spend long days in the lab, Nova Scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning, Kelvin said. Stay home, and if you must go out, stay away from other people.   \"Social distancing is now the best weapon for fighting this virus,\ " she said.   Dal researchers sending medical supplies to heart of coronavirus outbreak Kelvin will be part of an online panel about COVID-19 on Wednesday night hosted by the MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance at Dalhousie University.

  The third year of Doug Yearwood's PhD at Queen's University isn't going as planned. Yearwood said he intended to do research and fieldwork for his dissertation on gentrification in Ottawa throughout the spring and summer. Instead, physical distancing measures meant to slow the spread of the COVID-19 prompted the Kingston, Ont., university to virtually shutdown its campus to students. \"There's all this uncertainty hanging over my head,\ " said Yearwood. \"It could push things back four months, it could push things back another year.\ " Despite the partial shutdown, Yearwood is facing a summer tuition bill of just under $2,000 — due on May 1 — even though many university services are now only accessible online and the possibility of completing fieldwork seems remote. \"The university is not, sort of, living up to our understanding of what we're paying tuition for,\" said Yearwood. \"We're not able to do fieldwork, we're not able to access the university and at the same time , we're not able to work.\ " Yearwood is one of many graduate students calling on Canadian universities to waive summer tuition fees. They argue students no longer have physical access to many university services  — from libraries to offices  — and that missing months of fieldwork threatens to push back their master's and PhD program completion dates. Doug Yearwood, a third year PhD student at Queen's University, said fieldwork for his dissertation has been disrupted by physical distancing measures. (Frédéric Pepin/CBC News) Over 1,000 graduate students participated in an online letter writing campaign calling on Queen's University to suspend tuition payments. At Carleton University, fourth year PhD legal studies student Meg Lonergan is leading a similar campaign for tuition relief. Lonergan is president of the union that represents teaching and research assistants — many of whom are graduate students. Lonergan said many graduate students completing research projects aren't able to benefit from moving services online because there are no digital copies of the books they need to read. On top of that, many rely on in-person interviews or other research methods that would be difficult to complete while practising physical distancing.   \"I know a lot of my colleagues are having to really re-think their entire dissertations due to the restrictions,\ " Lonergan said in an interview on CBC Radio's All In A Day.   Universities offer financial assistance University administrations have so far resisted cancelling tuition payments. \"Even though we appreciate the difficult circumstances you are facing, Queen's, like many Canadian universities, is not in a position to waive graduate tuition for the summer term at this time,\ " Provost Mark Green wrote in a letter responding to student petitions.   \"While Queen's has moved to remote delivery for all courses, most supports and resources remain available to students to ensure the essential academic requirements of each degree program are maintained.\" Some graduate students say in these difficult times, their universities should scrap tuition fees for the summer 9:21 Instead of tuition relief, Queen's has introduced COVID-19 bursaries for international and domestic students. The university did not respond to a request for comment before publication. A statement from Carleton University said the university has made emergency funding available to graduate students based on their unique financial and academic circumstances, including an additional $7 million on top of $25 million normally allocated to student aid annually. \"Although Carleton has moved to online course delivery for the summer term, most supports and resources remain available,\" the statement said. Additionally, Carleton said if a student's research has been disrupted, requests for leaves of absence will be reasonably accommodated.   Students facing bleak job market this summer Trudeau announces $9B in financial support for students; critics say pandemic aid must flow faster   The federal government announced $9 billion in support measures for students last week, including increased funding for research and job training, as well as a financial benefit payment targeted toward students —  the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB). CESB recipients would receive $1,250 per month, which is lower than the $2,000 paid out by the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for individuals who have lost income due to COVID-19. Lonergan said despite these new measures, governments and universities remain too focused on undergraduate students when designing relief measures.   \"Graduate students are falling through the cracks,\" said Lonergan.  
  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV. 
  An old ebola drug being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 is capable of tricking the virus responsible for the deadly respiratory disease, a new University of Alberta study suggests.   The drug remdesivir is capable of halting the coronavirus from replicating, according to new research published Monday in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The study, led by Matthias Götte, chair of medical microbiology and immunology at U of A, demonstrates how the antiviral drug disrupts the virus by attacking enzymes known as polymerases. When viruses infect our body, they hijack our cells to replicate themselves, making more viruses that can go on to infect other cells or people, Götte said in a news release Monday. Remdesivir takes advantage of the coronavirus' natural life cycle, infiltrating the virus' genome and effectively shutting down its ability to make copies of itself, he said.   Replication of the virus relies on the polymerases, enzymes which synthesize the virus' genome by assembling sequences of RNA molecules. Remdesivir inhibits this process by masquerading as a part of the virus itself and damaging it from the inside, Götte said.     The drug has proven a \"very potent inhibitor,\" he said.   \"If you target the polymerase, the virus cannot spread, so it's a very logical target for treatment,\ " Götte said. \"These coronavirus polymerases are sloppy and they get fooled, so the inhibitor gets incorporated many times and the virus can no longer replicate.\"  ' A very potent inhibitor' The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies involving hundreds of patients around the globe began in early March. And while the study supports the need for clinical study, results obtained in the lab cannot predict how the drug will work on people, Götte said.   Ongoing clinical trials will be the true test, Götte said. Those results can be expected as early as April or May. American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences developed the drug remdesivir as a response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed the drug was not particularly effective against Ebola, but testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. A previous study by Götte and his team, published in February, demonstrated that the drug was effective against MERS, a related coronavirus. \"We were optimistic that we would see the same results against the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" Götte said.  SARS-CoV-2 virus is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \"We obtained almost identical results as we reported previously with MERS, so we see that remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor for coronavirus polymerases.\ " Last month, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will assess patients across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers. Götte is optimistic the ongoing global effort to find effective treatments for COVID-19 will be successful. \"We are desperate, but we still have to keep the bar high for anything that we put into clinical trials,\" Götte said.   Treating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon
  London researchers are using patients who are in hospital with COVID-19 to study how the virus is impacting their immune system. Researchers hope to address reports that the novel coronavirus can be helped with immunosuppressant therapies.   Immunosuppressants are given to organ transplant recipients or patients who have diseases such as lupus, inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis, in an effort to turn off the body's initial immune response.   Some early reports from scientists and physicians working with COVID-19 patients indicate that this virus may cause a cytokine storm, or a heightened immune response, in some patients, researchers say.   Coronavirus: The latest in drug treatment and vaccine developmentWestern researchers get nearly $1M to start work on COVID-19 vaccine \"Some researchers are suggesting that mortality could be improved with immunosuppressive therapies, however, evidence to support this is severely lacking at this time,\" said Dr. Douglas Fraser, the study's lead researcher and Paediatric Critical Care Physician at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC). Researchers are taking blood samples every day from patients at LHSC who are presumed to have COVID-19.   Those samples are then tested and the body's immune response over time is noted.   The response is being compared to that of patients with other infections as well as in healthy people. The data is being recorded and can be used for future studies.   \"If a hyperinflammatory response is found to contribute to greater adverse outcomes from COVID-19, there are current therapies available to help these cases,\ " Fraser said. \"This study could also inform why some people become critically ill and others do not, and help determine who will respond to certain therapies.\" The research will help scientists understand how the body's immune system reacts to COVID-19.  
  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the new coronavirus an emergency of \"international concern\" on Jan. 30, after it was first reported from Wuhan, China, late last year.  Canadian officials stress that the risk of contracting the virus in this country remains low. But Canadians are worried and want information about the disease.   Here are the latest developments:   China on Wednesday reported another drop in the number of new cases of the viral infection and 97 more deaths, pushing the total dead past 1,100. The illness has a new name: COVID-19. Despite the official end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday, many businesses in China remain closed. Japan's health ministry has confirmed 174 cases aboard Carnival Corp.'s Diamond Princess, which is docked in Yokohama.     What is a coronavirus?   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness, including the common cold, pneumonia, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19, the illness at the centre of the current outbreak.   The group responsible for classifying and naming viruses has tentatively called the virus  2019-nCoV— not to be confused with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. WATCH | A short video answering many of the main questions:  Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness? CBC News medical contributor and family physician Dr. Peter Lin breaks down the facts about what it is, where it came from, how it spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. 5:10 Why doctors find fighting the coronavirus so challengingHow social media platforms are fighting coronavirus misinformation  Follow the spread of this new coronavirus on this interactive map    The symptoms The initial symptoms are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest X-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.   The WHO says signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe respiratory problems, kidney failure and even death.    Read more about the symptoms here Are your kids worried about the coronavirus?

He says this coronavirus is not as contagious as influenza, nor as dangerous as SARS.   Infectious disease specialist says risk to Canadians is low 0:46 What to do if you think you've been exposed If you think you have been exposed to the coronavirus — for example, if you have travelled to Wuhan or Hubei province and are having symptoms — the Public Health Agency of Canada advises avoiding contact with others and following up with your health-care professional. This story explains what you should do to avoid spreading the infection to anyone else as you seek medical help.   Preventing the spread According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, coronaviruses are most commonly spread by:   Coughing or sneezing. Close personal contact, such as shaking hands. Touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.    To prevent infection:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.   Read more about symptoms and prevention here.   A vaccine Scientists work at Saskatoon's VIDO-InterVac laboratory, where research on a vaccine for the coronavirus is underway.   (David Stobbe/VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan/Reuters) CBC News got access to the high-security lab in Saskatchewan where scientists are working to develop a vaccine.   Where this coronavirus came from  The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) One of the main ways scientists can figure out how to prevent the spread of an infectious disease is to zero in on its animal host and how it jumped from that animal to a person. Chinese doctor who sounded the alarm about coronavirus dies from the illness According to Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist who teaches medical students about environmental change and human health at the University of Toronto, \"if we don't deal with the heart of the problem where these things can emerge, it could easily happen again.\ " You can read more about why it is so crucial for scientists to figure out the animal source of the coronavirus here.

  The federal government is committing an additional $20 million in funding for research into the COVID-19 outbreak after previously pledging nearly $7 million in February; several B.C.-based researchers are among those receiving grants.   Researchers from the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, the University of the Fraser Valley, and Royal Roads University had projects selected to receive the two-year grants, which can amount to $1 million for medical countermeasures, and $500,000 for social and policy countermeasures.   \"I think this whole collection of researchers makes for a vibrant community and a lot of knowledge sharing,\" said Dr. Srinivas Murthy, a UBC associate professor in pediatrics, who is leading a project in search of a treatment. Murthy is organizing randomized clinical trials in Canada for patients infected with COVID-19 to see which medication works best to combat the disease.    Flight attendants wear masks while travelling through Vancouver International Airport on Jan. 28. (Ben Nelms/CBC) \"The first drug we're testing is a medication that we use for HIV, which is the virus that causes AIDS so it's a medication that we've had for 20 years now and it's been proven very safe, and a bunch of people have thought that it would be effective against coronavirus,\" said Murthy. \"It works on it in a lab setting, but we don't know if it works in a real life patient setting, and so what we're hoping to do is run a study to see if it does work in that real life setting.\" Murthy says regulatory approvals for their clinical trials are happening right now, and they hope to operate in 30 to 40 hospitals across Canada. Social scientists examine other aspects But it's not just laboratory doctors who will receive federal funding in the global response against COVID-19. Social scientists and researchers will be looking at completely different aspects of the outbreak. Cindy Jardine, a Canada Research Chair in health and community at University of the Fraser Valley, and Yue Quian, an associate professor of sociology at UBC are two researchers who received funding for their projects.   Quian's project will look at how people and communities react to and cope mentally with quarantine by studying a group of people affected by the quarantine in the city of Wuhan, China, which has effectively been shut down since Jan. 23.   The shutdown of the city — which has a population of 11 million and is considered the epicentre of COVID-19 — is thought to be the largest quarantine in human history.   The research has a personal resonance for Quian. She was born and raised in Wuhan, and her father is living alone in the city under quarantine.    \"I try to contact him very regularly to provide some virtual company to him,\" she said. \"[But] the people in Wuhan now ... they seem to have developed some daily routine to cope with these quarantine lifestyle.\" Jardine's project will look at the role of travel in the transmission of COVID-19, specifically people travelling back to their countries of origin, and potentially what kind of communication is necessary to adequately confer risk.   B.C. ramps up coronavirus response, activates provincial pandemic co-ordination plan \"We're focusing on how people ... decide to act on information and that's very much determined by the cultural lens in which they view information and decide what's important to them or not,\ " Jardine said.    Quian says projects like these provide important context to the headlines. \"A lot of times when we think about these contagious disease epidemics, we think about how many people died, how many new confirmed cases we have, but as the WHO has pointed out, we need to remember those are people not numbers,\ " she said.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca   The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan to marshal Canada's scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government's strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials and expanding national testing and modelling.   $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.   In mid-March, the Trudeau government committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan's reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided the number of cases there stays low.   Premier Scott Moe said restrictions will be lifted May 4 for dentists' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers.

(Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.   For the next phases  — for which there are no start dates yet —  officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government's plan doesn't provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. ' Not exactly islands'   Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. \"Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,\ " he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. \"We are going to have to make sure we're on the same page with this.\" ' Failing our parents, our grandparents': Trudeau Trudeau said the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. \"If you're angry, frustrated, scared, you're right to feel this way.

There is no known cure or targeted treatment for coronavirus and research is ongoing. \"BREAKING: New controlled clinical study conducted by doctors in France shows that hydroxychloroquine cures 100 per cent of coronavirus patients within six days of treatment,\ " she wrote on Saturday, with a link to a blog that reports on technology startups.  That tweet was deleted after it received a flood of criticism. Danielle: you’re a journalist. Please, please, stick with reliable sources and reputable outlets. Evidence hydroxychloroquine can work is THIN AND ANECDOTAL. <a href=\"https://t.co/ Osm32zsLP6\">https://t.co/ Osm32zsLP6</a>&mdash;@markusoff I'm not linking to her posts anymore, just reporting them, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABDanielleSmith?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@ABDanielleSmith</a >'s feed is recklessly irresponsible. If anyone who follows me is a friend of hers, she needs an intervention. This is not a political game, thousands of lives are at stake < a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19b?src= hash&amp;ref_src =twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19b</a>&mdash;@theturner On Sunday, Smith apologized on Twitter for any undue anxiety and frustration caused by her deleted tweet — which she described as a retweet, which means sharing another user's tweet, not something she wrote — and said she would be more careful in the future. \"I deleted a retweet from yesterday that unintentionally created confusion and panic around a potential pharmaceutical solution for COVID-19. As the pandemic unfolds, I have many experts on the air to discuss potential treatment options,\ " she said. Radio host Danielle Smith has apologized and deleted a tweet that claimed a cure has been found for coronavirus but has left up other tweets making similar, unproven claims. (Danielle Smith/Twitter) The blog post in Smith's tweet references a French study of 26 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Six patients dropped out of the non-randomized study — one died, one developed nausea, three were transferred to intensive care, and one left — and of those who remained, they were tested for COVID-19 under a more relaxed definition than that used by most health authorities.   If there really was something that worked and it was clear and the evidence supported it, I promise you we would know​​​​.- Timothy Caulfield The study gained prominence after being touted by U.S. President Donald Trump, but was largely denounced by doctors including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying while potentially promising the science is largely anecdotal.   Other doctors have cautioned that the combination of drugs could be harmful if taken without proper medical supervision, and The Washington Post reported those touting the unproven cure have caused shortages of the drugs which are needed to treat lupus and arthritis patients.   Smith also shared a link to another blog, which primarily publishes anti-climate science writing, suggesting the same drugs and tonic water could be effective against coronavirus. She also tweeted that she would be doing her part in stopping COVID-19, as per President Trump's comments on anti-malarials, by drinking tonic water. One of those two tweets was deleted later Sunday, after this article was originally published. The other tweet has not been deleted. Global News said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, two days after this article was published, that it took action in response to Smith's tweet. \"Global News took immediate action when the tweet from our talk radio personality came to our attention. We do not support posting information that does not come from credible sources and remain steadfast in our commitment to being a responsible, trustworthy source for all Canadians,\" an emailed statement read. ' We need to be really careful' Timothy Caulfield, a Canada Research Chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta who focuses on debunking pseudoscience and unproven health advice, said Smith's tweets are disappointing. \"It really misses all the really crucial context and with a situation like this where there's so much uncertainty, so much fear, I think we need to be really careful how we represent the science,\ " he said. Caulfield said it's important to think of the multiple consequences that can stem from misinformation, like shortages of resources and that if we are going to talk about possible cures, media personalities do so in a careful way. \"I do think that if the public is hungry for information about the ongoing research, let's talk about it … the science has to be good. It has to be proven safe. So I think we need to represent the science in as accurate a manner as possible. We can still make science stories engaging, but let's make sure they're accurate,\ " he said.   Calgary clinic 'leveraging fear' with claim supplement helps prevent COVID-19, health expert says Clinic apologizes for claiming its supplement could prevent or treat COVID-19 Caulfield reminded people that it's important to look to trusted sources like the World Health Organization for information. \"There are no magical preventative steps beyond what we already know, wash your hands, social distancing. Those are the things that are really going to have an impact,\ " he said. \"If there really was something that worked and it was clear and the evidence supported it , I promise you we would know and we would hear about it from those respected voices.\" Smith's coronavirus comments are not the first time the former politician has been criticized for making an unproven health claim on Twitter. In 2012, the then Opposition leader tweeted that thorough cooking can kill E. coli bacteria, suggesting tainted meat could be fed to those in need, as the province was in the midst of a massive beef recall due to E. coli contamination. Research has shown that some E. coli bacteria can survive past the recommended temperatures for cooking meat.   There are more than 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada.

  As public health officials across the globe try to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, researchers at the University of Alberta are trying to get it into their lab and under their microscopes.   Researchers at the university's Li Ka Shing institute of virology have already ordered the virus' genetic material as they look to discover potential antivirals and vaccines. Director Dr. Lorne Tyrrell says the institute is also in the process of clearing the tight regulatory hurdles to acquire the entire virus.   \"We built the facilities so that we can handle the virus,\" Tyrrell said. \"We have a number of labs that are very keen to work on this virus, either on parts of the virus or the whole virus.\"  On Monday, the federal government launched a new slate of expedited funding opportunities for coronavirus researchers.   The Canadian Institutes of Health Research is offering two-year, $1-million grants to researchers working on counter measures to the virus, whether it's a way to help diagnose it or vaccines to prevent it. The deadline for applications close in a week, an indication of just how quickly researchers are mobilizing their efforts.    No immediate plan to change Canada's travel, isolation rules as global number of coronavirus cases climbs Morneau warns that coronavirus will have a 'real' impact on Canadian economy   Tyrrell says he is confident the institute will have the entire virus within two weeks and there's no reason for the general public to be concerned. \"If the general population is concerned, just think about the people that are working with these viruses all the time,\ " he said.  \"But they have learned to work with them, it's very safe and there should be no problem.\ " With the genetic material, researchers can build the virus' proteins in a lab. They can test what compounds could stop those proteins from activating and replicating the virus. And with that, they can start to develop potential antivirals and vaccines, which they would eventually test against the entire virus.   \"I just wanted people in Alberta to know that this institute is designed for this type of work. We have excellent virologists who are chomping at the bit to get this virus and begin their work.\" ' Around for quite a bit longer' The government launched the expedited research opportunities the same day health officials announced the coronavirus death toll had surpassed 1,000, eclipsing the number of people believed to have died in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.   \"I thought this virus was going to be controlled quicker by public health,\ " Tyrrell said.  \"I think they've done everything they possibly can, but I think this virus is showing signs that it might be around for quite a bit longer and more infectious.\" A quarantine site has been set up at the Canadian Forces base in Trenton, Ont., for hundreds of Canadians evacuated from China.   The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The total number of confirmed cases in China reached 40,325 by Monday morning, with another 319 cases confirmed in other countries.    'Safe in their care': Evacuees describe life under quarantine at CFB Trenton Coronavirus deaths in China pass 1,000, WHO warns epidemic must not spread out of control   In an ideal scenario, Tyrrell said researchers will find compounds already approved for use in other vaccines and antivirals that are effective against the coronavirus. It would take months and potentially years to get new medications approved for human use, Tyrrell said.   \"At the end of the day, this is about trying to find, through cooperation around the world, the best and fastest way we can to control this epidemic so that people are safe and can travel again without a problem.\"
 Governments and technology companies around the world are working quickly to unveil contact tracing abilities, which could prove to be an important tool in limiting the spread of COVID-19, especially as more countries begin to loosen restrictions and reopen their economies. Yet while these types of tools are expected to be useful in protecting the general population, they may not be as helpful for many workers in the industrial sector, where certain protective equipment, technology and physical distancing isn't always practical. Some of the largest outbreaks in Canada have taken place in these types of workplaces, such as the hundreds of confirmed cases linked to meat-processing facilities as well as infections in several provinces traced back to a single Alberta oilsands work camp. \"There is an inherently riskier nature to working in those settings, compared to me working in an office building far apart, in my little cubicle, from other people,\" said Dr. Jia Hu, a public health physician with Alberta Health Services. As part of his job with AHS, he helps co-ordinate contract tracing for the province. 1 in 4 Alberta COVID-19 cases now tied to meat plant, as outbreak spreads to nearby First NationB.C. expects more cases linked to Alberta oilsands project \"Anytime you have people work or live in crowded conditions, it's easier to spread disease. We're worried about those settings. I think a lot of these have caught public health authorities off-guard,\ " Hu said. Calgary-based public health physician Dr. Jia Hu says the three best ways to reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases is widespread testing, contact tracing and physical distancing. (Erin Collins/CBC) That's why researchers are trying to find solutions specifically for the industrial sector. Collecting data to track infections One of these new projects is a device by Calgary-based Blackline Safety that became available this week. The company's software allows a company to track the movements of workers on a job site to monitor physical distancing requirements in real time — and, if an employee tests positive for the virus, to be able to do contact tracing and identify other workers who may have also come in contact with the virus. It's the type of technology that many other researchers are developing — including in Britain, where the National Health Service is working on an app that would record data on a person's smartphone whenever they come in close contact with other people. If a person were to test positive for the virus, that data could be used to identify everyone else who may have been infected as well. But in many industrial workplaces, smartphones aren't permitted due to safety concerns. That's why Blackline developed its technology using a wearable device, which according to the company is already used by 60,000 workers in Canada and around the world. Blackline Safety's contact tracing tool helps companies monitor social distancing and also trace person-to-person contacts if an employee tests positive for the virus. (Submitted by Blackline Safety) Cody Slater, chief executive of Blackline, sees potential use for the technology in many sectors, such as utilities, food processing plants and chemical facilities, among others. \"This really gives companies a proactive tool to manage their workforce in the world of COVID,\" he said. Developing home test kits Slater said industrial companies are usually quick to adapt to workplace challenges because physical safety is such an important part of their business. \"That's the reason why we're seeing such a quick interest in this kind of industrial contact tracing and social distancing, because those companies realize they have different challenges than the average [business] out there,\" he said.   Another possible protective tool for the industrial sector is based on technology already used in Suncor Energy's refinery in Sarnia, Ont. The Calgary-based oil and gas company is working with researchers in hopes of developing COVID-19 home antibody test kits that are affordable and provide results quickly. Canadian oil companies start revealing their profit numbers — and they won't be prettyTracking the coronavirus: The latest figures from across the country and around the world The kits would rely on techniques similar to those Suncor uses to treat wastewater at its Sarnia facility, using proteins to assist in breaking down contaminants. The company is partnering with researchers at Western University through Mitacs, a not-for-profit innovation organization. \"It's basically a direct spinoff of work that was already going on at Suncor, so they responded very quickly to our call for ideas to help with the COVID-19 crisis,\" said John Hepburn, CEO and scientific director of Mitacs. Identifying antibodies Researchers are looking at whether the kits would be able to identify antibodies and whether that would give someone immunity from the virus or not. A truck approaches Cargill meat-packing facility in southern Alberta, which is the site of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in the province. (Charlotte Dumoulin/Radio-Canada) \"If it turns out that having antibodies does render immunity from the virus, it would be helpful to know that,\ " Hepburn said. If the technology works, Hepburn said it could not only help companies like Suncor but other workplaces as well, from a retail store to a meat-processing plant. In other words, \"companies where it is quite difficult to operate and maintain the two-metres distance and have the protective gear you need to operate safely.\ " Hepburn said Suncor is providing its information in an open-source format so it's available to other researchers around the world. 
  Now that the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, shutting down cities and even an entire country, many people want to know more about what they can do to fight COVID-19.     Canada confirmed its first case on Jan. 25 and as the new virus makes its way around the world, here's a breakdown of what it is, who is most at risk, and most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself.   1. What is COVID-19?   It's the illness that's caused by a viral respiratory infection. The virus that leads to COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2​​​​. Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinical scientist with Sinai Health System in Toronto, said SARS-CoV-2 probably started showing up in China in November 2019. The World Health Organization says Chinese officials first reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause to the WHO Country Office on Dec. 31, 2019.     What we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreak    A woman crosses a main street in the centre of Beijing, virtually empty over the past three weeks due to the coronavirus crisis. (Saša Petricic/CBC) 2. Who is most at risk?   Overall, 80 per cent of those who get infected will have mild symptoms, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert at University Health Network in Toronto.   Severe COVID-19 cases are more common for those who are \"older, immunocompromised and/or have underlying health issues,\" said McGeer.   Visitors to Toronto’s Eaton Centre take advantage of complimentary hand sanitizer amid mounting concerns over the spread of COVID-19 on March 4, 2020. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) In February, China's centre for disease control and prevention (China CDC), published a study outlining the age and gender of 72,314 people infected with COVID-19.    The findings show that about 80 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 in China were 60 or older.    This virus does not infect you through your skin-Dr. Alison McGeer In Italy, the National Health Institute says the average age of patients who have died is 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems. \"The disease in children appears to be mild,\" said McGeer.   China CDC found that only 0.9 per cent of infections were children under the age of 10.    Canada's first COVID-19 death is not cause for panic — but shows need to protect most vulnerable   3. How can you protect yourself?   According to the World Health Organization:  Wash your hands frequently. Keep your hands away from your face. Maintain at least one-metre distance between you and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Stay home if you're unwell. Cough or sneeze into your sleeve.    Proper hand hygiene, said McGeer, can greatly reduce your risk of contracting the illness.    Registered nurse Barbara Brady is seen here wearing the garb that health-care professionals use when dealing with patients during outbreaks. It includes a disposable gown, gloves and a mask with a plastic eye shield.   (Talia Ricci/CBC) Although using soap to thoroughly cleanse your hands is best, \"if hand sanitizer is all you have, use that,\" said Bogoch.   \"Go for the hand sanitizer that has about 70 per cent alcohol,\" he said.   4. How does it spread?   The World Health Organization says the virus is spread from person-to-person through small droplets from an infected person's mouth or nose.   \"If you get the virus on your hands, this virus does not infect you through your skin,\" said McGeer.  \"It has to then be transmitted to your eyes, mouth or nose.\ "   Passengers leave Vancouver International Airport in masks during the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020.   (Maggie MacPherson/CBC) That's why it's so important to keep your hands away from your face, said Bogoch.   \"It's actually hard to do that in practice, but if people are mindful and don't touch their faces … they'll come into less contact with this virus,\ " said Bogoch. 5. Should you be stockpiling toilet paper? Food?   COVID-19 isn't a gastrointestinal virus, said McGeer.   \"We've seen quarantines in China and Italy … but there's not been a circumstance in which there has been shortages of food or or basic supplies or life saving medication.,\" she said.   Shoppers at Superstore buy paper towels and toilet paper in Vancouver on March 2, 2020. (Ben Nelms/CBC) If you do get sick, you will need to stay home for two weeks.   Having enough food for 14 days is key, said McGeer. You should also refill your prescriptions so you have enough medication to last through a quarantine.    6. What are the symptoms?   Though many people infected with COVID-19 may have few or no symptoms, the government of Canada's website says those symptoms include:   Fever Cough Difficulty breathing Pneumonia in both lungs  7. What happens if you get infected? Stay home, say both McGeer and Bogoch.   The government of Canada website also outlines that if you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital because your illness is severe, call ahead or tell officials that you have a respiratory illness right when you arrive.    Scientists work in the Containment Level 3 laboratory in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization's International Vaccine Centre at the University of Saskatchwan in Saskatoon. where the organization is currently researching a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. (David Stobbe/VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan/Reuters)   Canadians being urged to help 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19   8. What is next for the virus?   WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and some drug treatments are currently under investigation.   But Bogoch said a vaccine is at least a year away.   He said the infectious disease community believes that there are three scenarios for the future of COVID-19:    It will spread around the world and burn itself out. It will spread around the world and there will always be low-level transmission.   It will spread globally and eventually integrate itself into the colder seasonal viruses like the influenza virus.     \"We need to develop an effective vaccine to protect communities from this infection, because it's unlikely to go away anytime soon,\" said Bogoch.

  A technology originally conceived to remotely monitor the heart rates of premature babies has been transformed into a potential way to scan huge groups for illnesses like COVID-19. A Canadian company is adapting the technology for drones and closed-circuit video cameras. But being able to scan people from up to 50 metres away and tell if they're sick, potentially without them knowing, raises some big privacy concerns.   The technology connects video cameras, including those equipped with thermal-imaging systems, to a computer program with learning algorithms.   The system can monitor temperature, heart and respiratory rate, and tell when someone is sneezing or coughing. The computer can determine if someone has a respiratory illness or infectious disease, according to Javeen Chahl, a professor of engineering at the University of South Australia. Chahl headed up the research developing the system.   Equipping drones with this technology will allow the computer system to scan large groups to determine if they're sick.   (Draganfly Inc.) The more video the program has of people sick with a particular disease, the better it is at detecting signs of that illness. To get more footage of people with COVID-19, a pilot project using the system is expected to be run in the New York City area in the coming weeks.   The technology is attracting attention in Canada, where some airports have expressed an interest, according to Canadian drone manufacturer Draganfly Inc.     Chahl has partnered with Draganfly to expand the use of his research. The company wants to sell the technology to governments, along with medical and commercial customers.   Draganfly has a manufacturing plant in Saskatoon and offices in Vancouver and the U.S.  Much of its business has come from selling drones to first responders. Cameron Chell is the CEO of Draganfly Inc. (Draganfly Inc.) Both Chahl and Draganfly hope this technology will provide a quick way to screen for COVID-19 and help detect the spread of other diseases. \"This technology can be used … even as a global early-warning system,\" said Cameron Chell, the CEO of Draganfly Inc.  \"It's really designed to get stats on what's actually happening, so the real decisions can be made and policy can be set.\ " Chell said the cost of the pandemic has already been too high with thousands of deaths worldwide and billions of dollars in economic loss. He said being able to get timely information on how many people are sick and where they are located are ways to help governments and health authorities stop the spread of infectious diseases.   Chell plans to adapt the computer system to work with security cameras as well. (CBC) But developing this kind of technology, especially during an emergency, is a concern for David Fraser, a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper in Halifax. Fraser said sometimes companies and governments rush to develop technologies or procedures during a crisis without full consideration of public privacy or security.   He said proper checks and balances need to be put in place before any kind of new scanning technology is used. \"To widely deploy a technology to collect baseline health information about a population, and about its individuals who are part of that population, that needs to be justified. It needs to be justifiable and that needs to be a societal conversation,\" said Fraser.    \"It has generally been my experience that the people who make the tools, or deploy the tools, or sell the tools are not the ones in a good position to evaluate the privacy impact of those tools.\ "    David Fraser is a privacy lawyer with McInnes Cooper. (McInnes Cooper) Chell understands those privacy concerns. He said the system is not designed to single out individuals, but to monitor the health of a population. However, that capability might not be far away.   Chell likens the rise of this kind of medical scanning technology to the widespread use of metal detectors and body scanners at airports after 9/11. \"Health protection is as important as firearms protection,\" said Chell.  \"I think this is part of the new reality and we're going to have to learn how to be OK with it.\ " A health-care worker puts on a pair of gloves at a COVID-19 testing area in Burnaby, B.C., earlier this month. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press) Once the computer scans enough people with COVID-19, it could be used to screen individuals before they come into a hospital or health-care centre, said Chahl.   The system is not meant to replace traditional diagnostic tests, but can provide an additional screening method.   The computer could identify people with symptoms so they can be isolated as soon as they enter a facility. \"If you reduce … essential services personnel to half as much risk then they might be able to keep operating for twice as long before they contract the virus, for example. So it's a great benefit to filter and screen,\" said Chahl.    Thomas Trappenberg is a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University who researches machine learning.   (Thomas Trappenberg) Equipping a drone with the system would also be helpful, according to Chahl. He said if an organization was involved in a relief effort in an area hard hit by an infectious disease, a drone could get an idea of the health of the population without endangering anyone. But that's not yet possible.   No one is sure how much information would have to be fed into the system before it could correctly identify one illness from another.    It is possible to use computer programs to tell when a person is sick.  However, it's tricky trying to teach a machine how to identify a specific illness, according to Thomas Trappenberg, a professor of computer science at Dalhousie University. Trappenberg studies machine learning, the mechanism Chahl's computer program uses to identify sickness. \"They need a lot of data,\" said Trappenberg. \"How many data we have to feed them is also very hard to predict. \"I think this is what the company is trying to do right now, trying to get more images, and it is a little bit stabbing in the dark. But it's well worth probably trying it.\ " Draganfly has made a name for itself by selling its products to first responders in the United States.   (Draganfly Inc.) There are other problems that will have to be solved before the technology can be effective, according to Sageev Oore, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, also at Dalhousie.   \"On real streets with real people in real weather conditions, with real movement and real camera lenses that might get a little piece of dirt on them, all of those things add, cumulatively, a lot of challenge,\" said Oore.    Even so, Oore thinks the research is worth doing.   Chahl said more needs to be done before the system reaches its full potential.   Still the technology has been used to detect whether people were alive under debris, by comparing the way debris shifted in relation to a person's breathing frequency. It also succeeded at measuring the heart rate of premature babies in incubators.    Trying to figure out the heart rates of babies without the use of electrodes or other equipment is how the project started back in 2015.   Fraser said even with those successes, it's important the determinations the computer makes about someone's health are confirmed by medical testing. He applauds people who want to use their skills to try to help society cope with this pandemic, but he said people still need to be cautious.    MORE TOP STORIES  Some N.S. nursing homes end window visits amid COVID-19 concernsMedical marathon: Doctors deal with their own stress so they can fight COVID-19CBRM's struggle with virtual council meetings may be overPremier rolls out emergency plan to deal with COVID-19 at NorthwoodUnion asked to find more workers to help at Northwood  
  A University of Saskatchewan research team and scientists from across the country have been awarded $1 million over two years to develop animal models and test vaccine candidates to find a vaccine for COVID-19. The project is being led by the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac), and is part of a rapid research funding initiative, designed to contribute to efforts to contain COVID-19.   PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccineSask. researchers aiming to develop a vaccine for coronavirus outbreak in China Volker Gerdts, director of VIDO-InterVac, said a race is underway to find the best animal for replicating the disease.   \"Is it mice, hamsters, or ferrets? Whichever model works best is the one we're going to use,\ " he said in a statement provided by the university.   \"Once the model is developed, we will then be able to test our vaccine candidates for effectiveness.\"   He said the virus is already being grown in VIDO-InterVac labs and the process of developing an animal model is already underway. The lab has already infected some ferrets with COVID-19. The lab's vaccine is also already being generated; Gerdts said with the money in hand, the lab can now begin testing the vaccine on animals and study the safety of the vaccine. He said once the vaccine has passed safety tests on animals, it will need to be studied in humans. Researchers also hope to better understand issues like transmission between animals, impact of age on disease and susceptibility of agricultural animals like chickens or pigs.   \"The goal is to develop a disease in these animals that is similar to humans, so that we then can use that as a read-out to show that our vaccine works, or it doesn't,\ " Gerdts told CBC News. The 12-member team is led by Darryl Falzarano. He said the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine that provides protection against multiple coronaviruses. 
  Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory is developing diagnostic tests for the new coronavirus infection that has sickened at least 40 people worldwide and caused at least 20 deaths. The Winnipeg lab obtained a live sample of the novel coronavirus from Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on May 4. A colourized transmission electron micrograph shows a virion of the novel coronavirus that emerged in 2012 and has sickened at least 40 people, with at least 20 deaths. (National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Canadian Press) The virus strain is the human beta-coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), a spokesperson for the agency said in an email. The lab's research priorities for the virus include:  Developing important diagnostic tests, including a test to detect antibodies against the virus, which will allow researchers to determine with greater accuracy if someone has been exposed to the virus. Testing antivirals to determine if they are effective against the virus. Understanding which animals might act as host reservoirs for the virus and if they have the capability to spread the virus. Using advanced technologies to develop and test vaccines to determine if they provide protection against the virus.   Doctors and researchers want to develop antibody tests to help with diagnosis. \"The virus is only there for a short period of time so you can't really tell whether somebody had a past infection or not whereas antibodies allow you to do that,\" said Dr. Frank Plummer, the scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory.   Provincial public health laboratories can also detect the coronavirus using diagnostic tests that the national lab produced using the genetic sequence data of the new virus. The virus first appeared last year in the Middle East and travellers have brought it to France, Britain and Germany. \"The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed WHO of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases with infection of the novel coronavirus,\" the UN health agency said in a statement Wednesday. It is the first time that health-care workers have been confirmed with the infection from exposure to patients, Gregory Hartl, head of public relations and social media for WHO, said in an email. Hartl said he did not know what kind of health-care workers they were. The agency says health-care facilities caring for patients with suspected coronavirus infections should take \"appropriate measures\" to decrease the risk of transmission to other patients and health-care workers. WHO officials visiting Saudi Arabia to consult on the outbreak have said the virus could pass between humans after prolonged, close contact. There have been no cases detected in Canada. 
  Social distancing and the potential for contaminated surfaces mean you should be careful about how your child is using playground equipment, says an infectious disease specialist. Around the world, countries have put measures in place to try to slow the spread of the pandemic. On P.E.I., the Chief Public Health Office has asked non-essential services to close, and schools and daycares are already shut down.   A little bit of extra caution for the next couple of weeks is very well worth it.— Dr. Lisa Barrett The City of Charlottetown closed its playgrounds Friday morning, and the Municipality of Kings in Nova Scotia is cautioning against their use.   Dr. Lisa Barrett, a clinical scientist and infectious disease physician at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said playgrounds aren't immune to spreading the virus. \"It seems to be that, in general, this virus can live outside humans and then can infect other humans maybe for up to three to 72 hours,\" said Barrett. \"The take-home message is that virus could be on some public surfaces where people touch them a lot, especially if they haven't washed their hands.\" Passing by touch Researchers have determined that coronavirus is \"not a jumping virus,\" said Barrett. It can't jump from one surface to another, for example, from a swing to your child's mouth. To get COVID-19 from that swing, your child would have to touch it with their hands and then touch their face. It could also be carried from swing to face if the child is wearing mittens and touches the swing and then their face. Coronavirus could potentially survive on playground surfaces, even in cold weather. (John Robertson/CBC) \"There's the occasional, you know, small kid or adult nose picker. There's the people who, you know, are nail biters,\" said Barrett. \"We touch our faces. It's a human behaviour that's very, very, very common.\ " But even if your child doesn't touch their face, Barrett stressed playgrounds still aren't ideal. \"This has nothing to do with the fact that the merry-go-round might have virus on it. It's the fact that there's lots of other people there,\ " she said, which could make social distancing difficult. Researchers still don't know how cold temperatures might affect the survival of the virus on surfaces, she added. ' Splitting hairs' Your own playground equipment, with controlled access in your backyard is fine, said Barrett. The problem arises when that playground is in a public location. Social distancing is difficult on a playground, says Dr. Lisa Barrett. (Nick Pearce) \"It's really hard to keep little kids six feet from each other,\ " she said. \"I'd say it's pretty darn impossible.\" Social distancing is important behaviour federal and health officials have recommended to combat the coronavirus.

 Editor's note: CBC News commissioned this public opinion research before concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic mounted. About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).  The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about energy transition between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes. As with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News — and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research — believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans' attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything. This is the fifth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:   CBC News poll: Albertans were already anxious. Then, the floor dropped out CBC News poll: Albertans were hurting financially even before COVID-19 OPINION | CBC News poll: More autonomy isn't on the agenda for most Albertans, especially given COVID-19 CBC News poll: In experts we trust (at least, more than we used to)   It was sombre. It was serious.   Premier Jason Kenney's televised address to Albertans last week delivered a sobering reckoning of  \"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation\" facing the Prairie province. First — and most pressing — the health crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic could, in a probable scenario, see as many as 800,000 infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths in Alberta. The economic ramifications of the infection are profound, with the most recent forecast estimating that one in four Albertans will lose their jobs and the crisis will \"permanently reshape\" the province's economy. As Kenney has said, it could be an economic disaster equivalent to or worse than the Great Depression. The International Monetary Fund's most recent estimates forecast massive global decline, and a terrible situation for energy prices — Alberta's bedrock industry. The future of the industry is unclear. A CBC News poll, taken just before the economic implications of the coronavirus were becoming clear, suggests 79 per cent of Albertans already thought that the province should transition toward renewable energy. More than nine in 10 Albertans also think the province should do more to encourage the development of the technology sector.    And 51 per cent think that the province should transition away from oil and gas.   While support for transitioning away from oil and gas is highest in Edmonton (58 per cent), it has similar levels of support in Calgary (55 per cent). Outside the province's two major cities, only about a third of Albertans (37 per cent) support moving away from oil and gas.   There is general agreement that Alberta needs more renewables. Albertans are divided on whether or not to wind down the oil and gas industry. The question is, how do you fix and reshape Alberta's energy-dependent economy while looking after people caught up in the change? Albertans have debated diversification for years, but there's an argument to be made that the coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to speed up diversifying the economy and transitioning to more renewable energy sources. A blend of traditional and renewable energy Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown has detected an increasing desire amongst Albertans to diversify Alberta's oil and gas-dependent economy over the past couple of years. \"Albertans don't necessarily want to abandon the oil and gas industry, but that doesn't mean they don't want to see the economy transition away from the oil and gas industry,\" said Brown, who conducted the research for CBC News.     \"It's about … keeping the industries that we rely on strong, and diversifying so that in the future we're not so reliant on any single industry,\" she added.    And that's key: To keep oil and gas viable in the short term, while beginning a green transition. Even before COVID-19, Kenney acknowledged that Alberta \"will see a gradual shift from hydrocarbon-based energy to other forms of energy.\ " That said, in recent weeks, Kenney has pressured the federal government to help the province's beleaguered energy industry, recently suggesting that he anticipates significant federal support for the sector.   That assistance has been expected for some time but hasn't yet arrived. The renewable energy industry, for its part, is pressuring Ottawa to stimulate the pandemic ravaged economy by investing in wind energy, hydro power and electric vehicles. At the same time, hundreds of academics — including prominent Alberta scholars — recently called on the federal Liberal government to reject bailing out Canada's energy industry, and instead accelerate a green transition. They stressed that \"growing demand for climate-friendly energy sources further threatens the viability of high cost, carbon-intensive oilsands production.\ " In an email statement to CBC News, Kavi Bal, the senior press secretary with Alberta's Ministry of Energy, said, \"We've always acknowledged the gradual energy transition, but by all accounts, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come — not just in Alberta, but globally.\ " In the same statement, Bal described the academics' open-letter as \"rich,\" noting that the \"Alberta-based signatories benefit from generous salaries, in part, because of the very oil and gas that they denounce.\ " For decades, Albertans have talked about economic diversification and energy transition, but the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has intensified the argument.    As Rahm Emmanuel, former U.S. president Barack Obama's first chief of staff, quipped to the Wall Street Journal, \"you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\" Calgary-based energy economist and investment strategist Peter Tertzakian foresees demand for oil returning after social distancing ends. But he anticipates an acceleration of the renewable energy transition.   (Supplied by Edward Ross) Don't waste a good crisis   Years ago, energy analysts debated when we'd reach \"peak oil\" or run out of the stuff.   Recently, some analysts have wondered when the demand for Alberta's crude will dwindle, replaced by alternative — greener — sources of energy. Others study how a balance could be achieved and how the transition could occur. Respected Calgary-based energy economist and investment strategist Peter Tertzakian foresees demand for oil returning after social distancing ends, but a \"bruised global economy with soft oil demand is a foregone conclusion.\"   Travel and commuting habits, he contends, may have forever changed because of the pandemic. And Tertzakian anticipates an acceleration of the renewable energy transition. \"I think it's going to happen. I support it,\" he said. \"But that should not be confused with the idea of putting the oil and gas industry here to bed.\" Morgan Bazilian, a professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines and the director of the Payne Institute, which researches public policy on earth resources, energy and the environment, says that the collapse in oil prices and the decline in its demand triggered by the pandemic highlights the need for Alberta to diversify its economy. Bazilian believes government stimulus packages aimed at kick starting the economy in the wake of the global pandemic need to be balanced between fossil fuels and renewable energy.   \"But simply saying that we will move all the stimulus money on the energy sector to change and become low-carbon right away is unlikely to be the wisest use of the … stimulus money,\" he added.   The pandemic and the economic fracture it triggered have revealed that there's no \"going back to business as usual,\" predicts Severson-Baker, the Alberta regional director for Pembina.   \"It'll be a long, slow recovery, if it ever recovers fully,\" for Alberta's energy industry, Severson-Baker added. \"And it'll be immediately followed by another decline in demand as a result of the world responding to the challenge of climate change.\" If change is upon us, the question becomes, how to deal with change the right way. Academics have studied historical energy transitions: what worked, and what didn't. They have identified some potential roads, and some potential roadblocks, ahead. Morgan Bazilian is a professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines and the director of the Payne Institute, which researches public policy on earth resources, energy and the environment. (Morgan Bazilian) Possible paths   Writing last May in the prestigious journal Nature, several respected energy analysts, including the above mentioned Bazilian, described four possible paths to a low-carbon future.   In the first scenario — what they call the Big Green Deal — government policies, investment and global co-operation accelerate a rapid decarbonization. Governments across the world spend billions on renewable energy, and financial markets divest themselves of fossil-fuel assets, reallocating to low-carbon investments. In the second imagined future — Technology Breakthrough — significant technological achievements allow renewable energy to displace fossil fuels, mitigating climate change.   In the third, somewhat dystopian future — Dirty Nationalism — populist governments protect the fossil fuel industries in their jurisdictions, fragmenting the global energy market and slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy.   In the final predicted future — Muddling On — the status quo persists. Fossil fuels remain the world's main energy source. Renewable energy claims a share of the energy mix as its costs decline, but not enough to mitigate climate change. Bazilian, believes the four models still hold up even in a post-pandemic world, adding that the \"dirty nationalism\" model was most closely aligned with the pre-pandemic situation where Saudi Arabia and Russia waged war over oil prices. Tertzakian, who has written two books about energy transition, stresses that Alberta is already transforming its energy system, pointing out that the province is moving to mothball coal-fired power plants by 2030.   The long-time energy watcher supports diversifying Alberta's economy and increasing renewable energy use. But he wonders what will replace the economic benefits of the oil industry. Canada remains, after all, the fourth largest producer and fourth largest exporter of oil in the world. In 2018, oil and gas extraction alone accounted for more than seven per cent of Canada's total gross domestic product (GDP), and it is our largest export. \"The reality is that the bulk of our oil and gas, the vast majority of it is exported and used elsewhere, for which we have substantial economic activity. So merely transitioning to renewables is not going to backfill that economic activity,\ " Tertzakian said. A balanced approach Bazilian says it's important for any energy transition strategy to take care of the people who lose jobs in the planned switch from, for example, coal-fired power plants to renewable power, such as wind-powered turbines.    \"You have to think about how it affects society from a social perspective,\" he cautioned.    The speed of change must be handled carefully as well.    \"Pace of change could really have some very negative connotations for citizens  … the poor and the marginalized will suffer even more.\"    So how to support both change and people? Chris Severson-Baker, the Alberta regional director at the Pembina Institute, says there’s no going back to business as usual after the pandemic. (Pembina Institute) Part of Alberta's plan to reduce its carbon emissions could begin with the existing oil and gas industry. The Pembina Institute's Severson-Baker wants the federal government to invest stimulus money in carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production. The energy industry, for its part, says any federal money should also help pay for the reclamation of inactive and orphan wells, creating jobs for out-of-work oil service workers. Tertzakian expects some of the coming stimulus spending will be directed into renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and into energy efficiency retrofits. But again, he cautions that, in the long run, it won't be enough to replace the economic activity generated by Alberta's oil and gas industry.    Tertzakian suggests turning to other natural resources, including forestry and agriculture. Alberta also has the advantage of relatively low electricity rates that could power newer industries, such as manufacturing and high-tech.   \"Now we have the opportunity to use what we have under our feet and around us to create an economy that is more resilient,\ " he said.    But when you discuss jobs, livelihoods and people, you run into political territory. The politics of transition   The CBC News Road Ahead 2020 poll found that, just as the economic impact of COVID-19 was hitting, 54 per cent of Albertans believed oil and gas companies have too much say in Alberta politics.   Some longtime political watchers say that, even before the coronavirus crisis began, the current provincial government was out of step with Albertans' hopes for energy diversification. \"The government is not, I think, listening to the public on these matters,\" said Duane Bratt, the head of the department of economics, justice, and policy studies at Mount Royal University. Taking a closer look at the polling data, we can break down Albertans based on their attitudes toward both types of energy transition. Almost half (48 per cent) agree with both increasing renewable energy and decreasing oil and gas production. One in three (30 per cent) support more renewables but don't want to move away from oil and gas.   Contrast that with only 16 per cent of Albertans who are opposed to both types of transition. And a mere two per cent who hold the curious position of wanting less oil and gas but not wanting more renewable energy sources. So, the debate isn't about whether Alberta needs more renewable energy. The argument in Albertans' minds is about the extent to which oil and gas remains a part of the province's future.   These divergent Alberta opinions on what exactly our next moves should be are something the provincial (and federal) government must grapple with in a post-pandemic economic reality.   Certainly, there are efforts already underway in Alberta to transition toward green energy. A spokesperson for the province's minister of energy points out that Alberta already supports renewable energy projects, such as the country's largest solar energy project near Vulcan, south of Calgary.   But current circumstances could force the UCP to accelerate economic diversification and energy transition, especially if demand for Alberta oil remains soft.   Tertzakian thinks economics will ultimately underpin politics. He predicts the UCP will definitely be talking more about diversification in the expected anemic economy that follows the coronavirus. \"I don't think it's lost on them,\ " he said.   Methodology: The CBC News random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger. The survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent. 
 Editor's note: CBC News commissioned this public opinion research before concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic mounted. About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).   The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about experts between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes. As with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News — and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research — believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans' attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything. This is the fourth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:   CBC News poll: Albertans were already anxious. Then, the floor dropped out CBC News poll: Albertans were hurting financially even before COVID-19 OPINION | CBC News Poll: More autonomy isn't on the agenda for most Albertans, especially given Covid-19   Alison Van Rosendaal's eureka moment about experts came while tossing and turning in bed at 2:30 in the morning, unable to sleep.   That's when she snapped a screen capture of Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw. Later, she traced the photo of the public health official with a felt pen, creating a T-shirt with the slogan \"What would Dr. Hinshaw do?\ " The shirt eventually raised thousands of dollars for children and food banks across the province. Van Rosendaal wanted to publicly extol Hinshaw's calm, reassuring and expert delivery of lifesaving information in her daily briefings from the provincial capital about the coronavirus sweeping across the globe.   \"When people have more trust in experts, we have more in common with one another,\ " she said. The Calgary assistant school principal believes Alberta needs experts and scientists more than ever in this moment of profound uncertainty.   Alison Van Rosendaal, right, had an idea late one night to honour the work of Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw. These T-shirts have raised thousands of dollars for food banks and food-insecure school children. (Submitted by Julie Van Rosendaal) Grassroots vs. elites   There has long been a tension in Alberta between \"grassroots\" thinking and the opinions of those who are referred to (often pejoratively) as \"elites.\ " This tension has been leveraged politically and socially to make arguments about whom to trust, but trust is more complicated than that. In the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, being an expert is suddenly cool; people are tuning in to their press conferences, heeding their advice. And a new poll for CBC News suggests that even before cases of COVID-19 swelled worldwide, Albertans' trust in experts was on the rise.   The poll found that 38 per cent of Albertans believe it's better to trust the down-to-earth thinking of ordinary people than the opinions of experts. That's a decline of seven percentage points from the last time CBC asked the same question, two years ago.   Remember, a poll is only a snapshot in time, and this is a very particular time in our society. But there could be longer-term implications for Alberta politics and society as we, and our politicians, rely on expert counsel during these troubled times.   Trust in experts expected to grow COVID-19 has concentrated Canadians' minds. We are increasingly turning to medical experts and scientists for information to keep us and our families safe. \"We're in a period right now where we're relying heavily on our experts to see us through,\" said Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown, who conducted the poll for CBC News. Brown thinks that trust will likely rise amongst Albertans as they look for reassuring, credible leaders to help explain the social and economic upheaval sparked by the global pandemic.   \"When you go through a crisis like this, it shouldn't be the majority rule,\ " Brown said. \"It should be the smartest people in the room taking control. And it's interesting to see that Albertans are thinking less in a grassroots way and thinking more about making smarter, strategic decisions and being driven by what experts tell us.\ "  Trust in government appears to be on the rise since self-isolating became the new normal.    An Angus Reid online poll of nearly 1,600 Canadians recently found that trust in all government officials — local, provincial and federal — has risen over the course of the pandemic.   By our nature, Canadians tend to defer to authority, says Duane Bratt, who heads the department of economics, justice and policy studies at Mount Royal University. \"I would say governments across Canada, no matter what their political affiliation is, have been fairly responsible, and have listened to the people who are experts in health pandemics,\" said Bratt.   Still, partisanship and ideology play a role in which Albertans trust experts. Trust and politics   Exactly half of United Conservative Party (UCP) supporters (50 per cent) say it's better to trust the down-to-earth thinking of ordinary people than experts. Only 24 per cent of New Democratic Party supporters agree with that sentiment. In fact, 72 per cent of NDP supporters disagree or strongly disagree with the idea of trusting down-to-earth thinking over experts.   Self-identified left-of-centre voters across Alberta prefer experts at 76 per cent; compared with 52 per cent of voters who describe themselves as either centrist or right of centre.   Politicians sometimes leverage the concept of \"out-of-touch elites\" — portraying themselves as \"grassroots\" or \"common sense\" to win votes.    It plays well for some voters, especially those with more traditional values, as we can see in the graph above. When it comes to religion, 48 per cent of those who say religion is important or somewhat important in their life trust experts over down-to-earth thinking. That number jumps to 67 per cent for non-religious voters. Education also makes a difference. While 70 per cent of people with a university degree would rather trust experts, just 33 per cent of Albertans with a high school education feel the same way.    There's also an age divide in Alberta. Fifty-one per cent of seniors are more likely to place their trust in down-to-earth thinking, versus only 30 per cent of those aged 18-24. But trust, it turns out, is a different story when it comes to political elites. (Dis)trust in politicians It can be argued that politicians, too, are experts and elites. We trust them to make deeply informed, substantive decisions about our lives, the economy and the law. But the CBC News Road Ahead 2020 survey suggests Albertans' distrust in politicians of all stripes remains high. A full 78 per cent think politicians lose touch after they get elected. This has declined only slightly — by four percentage points — since CBC News asked the same question in 2018.   \"I think the big story here is the lack of change,\" said data scientist John Santos, with Janet Brown Opinion Research. \"There's a slight drop between 2018 and 2020, and that's likely due to the UCP being in power and the fact that they have more partisans than the NDP does.\ "    There are simply more UCP supporters in Alberta than NDP partisans.     Broadly, though, this shows that disaffection and cynicism toward politicians continues to be high in Alberta.   Future trust   Weeks and months of watching public health and scientific experts on our TV screens, and seeing them quoted in the articles we read, could have an impact on how Albertans trust experts down the road.    \"People might be thinking, experts like doctors and epidemiologists and statisticians, those are the people that are really important right now and they're going to help us through this crisis,\" said Santos.   Alison Van Rosendaal, for her part, is heartened by the growing faith in experts amongst Albertans. She hopes this growing trust can help foster more collective action. \"To live in a world where people lean into the experts … means that more of us are on the same side,\ " she said. \"So that gives me hope.\" To track that , CBC News intends to repeat some aspects of the Road Ahead 2020 survey later in the year.   Methodology: The CBC News random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.

  Thousands of scientists around the world are working on problems raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the search for a vaccine against the virus. Canadian researchers are part of that search.    Here is a summary of some of the projects underway at Canadian universities: Western University in London, Ont., is working on a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on developing a coronavirus vaccine bank containing hundreds to thousands of potential vaccines that could be used at the start of another outbreak. The research builds on previous work done at the school for a vaccine against the MERS virus, another coronavirus related to the one now circulating. Researchers hope to develop ways to adapt vaccines effective against one virus to work against a related one. That would allow them to quickly produce new vaccines to fight future viral outbreaks. Testing in animals In Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan scientists are trying to identify what common lab and agricultural animals can be infected with the virus to better understand which animals may pose a risk and which may be used as models for human infection. The team will also use animals to ensure proposed vaccines don't actually worsen the infection, as has been observed elsewhere, and to determine whether animals can be used to test safety of vaccines. The university's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization is building a pilot-scale plant on campus for vaccine development. It says it's the first in the country to have a possible novel coronavirus vaccine for testing in animals.   The economics of finding a vaccine for COVID-19   Vaccine research The University of Alberta in Edmonton is also investigating possible coronavirus vaccine candidates. Researchers are building on previous experience to work toward developing methods for industry-scale vaccine purification. Meanwhile, a University of Alberta cancer researcher and his biotechnology company is working on a DNA vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. DNA-based vaccines introduce genetic material into a patient's cells, which causes them to make bits of the virus and trick the immune system into a response. Such a vaccine is easier to manufacture at scale, offers improved stability and doesn't need an infectious agent. The vaccine candidates are to be tested soon in animal models before moving to human trials. Reverse-engineering At Laval University in Quebec City, scientists who have already had success against the Zika and MERS viruses are trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine by reverse-engineering the genetics of the novel coronavirus. Data is to be used to identify bodies that can neutralize the virus. The research, conducted in conjunction with biotechnology companies, is also expected to yield information on vaccine safety as well as on how the target viruses damage and travel between their human hosts. Laval is also host to a project hoping to use nanoparticles to enhance the strength of an immune response and the speed of that response for any new vaccine. The project is also looking for ways to induce cells to produce antibodies against the virus. The two components would be combined into a vaccine. The approach has been used before during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and produces stable vaccines that can be stored for long periods. Antiviral agents In Winnipeg, a University of Manitoba team is looking at how the novel coronavirus gains entry to a healthy cell. Researchers suspect compounds that interfere with that mechanism could be used as vaccines. They've found a way to target cells that present antiviral agents to the immune system and hope to use those cells to transmit the compounds they've developed. University of British Columbia scientists are examining the effectiveness of previously known drugs against the novel coronavirus. Many viruses that affect human health are related, but it's not known if drugs developed to fight those are effective against COVID-19. The team is assessing the most likely drugs to work and, since it's already known they are safe, putting them into clinical trials. Work has already begun on a drug originally developed to fight HIV. 
  There is a lot of advice floating around about what can and can't protect you from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. But what's true and what's not? Here are some things that experts say don't work — and some that do. Things that don't actually work Hot water You may have read that drinking or gargling lots of hot water will flush the virus out of your throat and into your stomach where it will be destroyed by acid. However, Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director of infection prevention and control at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told CBC's Metro Morning Monday that he isn't aware of any evidence that that works: \"I certainly don't think it's being recommended by medical experts at this time.\ "  Hand dryers Yes, you should dry your hands with either a towel or hand dryer after cleaning them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. But the heat from hand dryers alone don't kill the virus, the World Health Organization says. Vaccinations for flu or pneumonia While these will protect you against two other respiratory diseases, they don't work against the virus that causes COVID-19.  That's why scientists are working so hard right now to develop and test a vaccine specifically for the illness. Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in CanadaTrying to ward off the coronavirus? What products help and what may be a waste of money Using a UV disinfection lamp While you may have heard of ultraviolet lamps being used to sanitize hospital surfaces or phones, they shouldn't be used on your skin as the radiation they emit can cause skin irritation, WHO says. Wearing gloves in public Regular gloves have minute holes in them and can become contaminated after touching surfaces.  That's why they're \"probably not effective,\ " Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, recently told the New York Times. Disposable gloves, like latex or vinyl, shouldn't have holes in theory, but experts say they could provide a false sense of security.  And if you touch your face with them, then you're still at risk, says medical microbiologist Dr. Jocelyn Srigley. The Tru-D SmartUVC disinfecting light is shown in this 2017 file photo. While ultraviolet light is used to disinfect phones and hospital equipment, it's not recommended for use on skin. (Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/The Associated Press) Spraying chlorine, bleach or alcohol on your body Don't do this. While bleach can be used to disinfect surfaces, it's corrosive and can harm your mucous membranes, such as your eyes or mouth, WHO warns. Rinsing your nose with saline regularly While there's some evidence this can help people recover more quickly from the common cold, it hasn't been shown to actually prevent respiratory infections, WHO says. Antibiotics These only work against bacteria, not viruses like the novel coronavirus. Bleach is good for disinfecting surfaces, but don't spray it on your body or gargle it, WHO says. (Scott Eells/Bloomberg) Vitamin C While many people think vitamin C prevents respiratory diseases, like colds, Health Canada doesn't allow manufacturers to claim that, as there simply isn't enough scientific evidence. Likewise, there's no evidence that vitamin C helps with COVID-19. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University, told the New York Times that if there's any benefit, it's going to be \"very modest.\" Other supplements and naturopathic remedies The College of Naturopathic Physicians of B.C. has issued a notice to the public, saying that \"any statements by naturopathic doctors about the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19, beyond the information made available by the public health authorities, are inappropriate, potentially harmful, and likely to violate\" the college's policies on false and misleading advertising.   It comes after a local city councillor and naturopath shared suggestions to \"strengthen our [immune] systems\" amid the pandemic. Eating garlic According to WHO, garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, but there's no evidence that eating it has protected people from COVID-19. Hand dryers alone don't prevent you from getting COVID-19, but it is recommended that you dry your hands after washing thoroughly with soap and water, which does wash the virus off your hands. (Doug Ives/ The Canadian Press) Things that work — to some extent Face masks If you're sick, a face mask can reduce the chance you'll pass the illness onto others  — but experts caution that it won't necessarily protect you from catching COVID-19, as masks don't cover your eyes and may cause you to touch your face to put it on, take it off or adjust it. If you are healthy, WHO recommends you use a mask only when caring for someone with a COVID-19 infection.    Read more about when, how and why you'd wear a face mask   WATCH | Will wearing a mask protect you from the coronavirus? You see more people wearing them in public, but will wearing a face mask really protect you from the coronavirus?     2:27 Hand sanitizer Hand sanitizer will typically kill viruses, like the novel coronavirus, if it's at least 60 per cent alcohol. But \"washing your hands [with soap and water] is always better,\ " York University biology professor Dawn Bazely said in a recent interview with CBC News. Things that will actually work Handwashing According to the World Health Organization , this is the best way to protect yourself against COVID-19. The virus causes infection when it enters your eyes, mouth or nose — usually from you touching your face with your hands. If you wash the virus off your hands, that won't occur. WATCH | Handwashing put to the test: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03 Social distancing The disease is transmitted from other people via droplets that can be sprayed up to two metres when a person sneezes or coughs.  Or via the things that people touch, such as surfaces or each others' hands. By minimizing your contact with other people and staying at least one to two metres away, you can also reduce the risk of transmission. Experts also say people should self-isolate at home if they feel unwell. And everyone should practise good respiratory hygiene, such as sneezing or coughing into a bent elbow or tissue (and then disposing of that tissue immediately). Got questions about physical distancing? Here's what you need to knowCBC ExplainsDo I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? And if you already have COVID-19... In addition to continuing to practise the good hygiene measures outlined above to avoid passing on the virus, you can also treat the fever with ibuprofen and other drugs typically used for fevers. Previously, there had been some caution against using ibuprofen to ease symptoms of the disease, but WHO said there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition. Further, if you have symptoms of the illness, the first step is to contact your health-care provider or local public health agency.  Do not show up unannounced at a clinic or hospital. However, if you have a sharp turn in your condition, including shortness of breath, call 911 or your local emergency number. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory
  This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning.  If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through droplets that we spew as we breathe, talk, cough and sneeze — so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye.   That's why questions remain about the virus's transmission and what precautions need to be taken to curb its spread as governments begin to lift restrictions. Will it help if everyone wears a mask? Is keeping everyone two metres apart far enough? Some researchers aim to learn more about transmission by trying to make invisible sneezes, coughs and breaths more visible. Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal. How do scientists think COVID-19 is transmitted? According to the World Health Organization, the disease spreads primarily through tiny droplets expelled when a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 sneezes, coughs, exhales or spits while talking. They can infect another person who:   Comes into contact with those droplets through their eyes, nose or mouth (droplet transmission).    Touches objects or surfaces on which droplets have landed and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth (contact transmission).    The WHO says it's important to stay \"more than one metre away\" from a person who is sick. But the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends staying a distance of at least two metres or two arms' lengths away, not just from people who are sick but from all people you don't live with. Why is 2 metres the recommended distance for preventing transmission? Scientists in the 19th century showed respiratory droplets from a person's nose and mouth can carry micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Then, in 1934, W.F. Wells at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that large droplets (bigger than 0.1 millimetre) tended to fall and settle on the ground within a distance of two metres, while smaller droplets evaporated and the virus particles left behind could remain suspended in the air for a long time.   Wells proposed that could explain how diseases are transmitted. Since then, respiratory diseases have been divided into those transmitted via droplets (usually from close contact) and those that are airborne and can spread over longer distances, such as measles or tuberculosis.   INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday Such tiny particles are presumably pushed around by air currents, but can't move easily due to air resistance. So their actual movements haven't been well modelled or measured, said Lydia Bourouiba, professor and director of the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   \"And that's why the notion of airborne [transmission] is very murky,\" said Bourouiba, who is Canadian. Why don't experts think the virus is airborne? A pair of recent studies raised the notion of airborne transmission, but Mark Loeb, a professor at Hamilton's McMaster University who specializes in infectious disease research, cautions against putting too much stock in them.   Researchers found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in washrooms and some high-traffic areas in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and in Nebraska, and suggested it got into those areas through the air, though there was no evidence the particles were still infectious.   Loeb said that's just a \"signal\" that part of the virus was there.   \"Does it mean that COVID-19 is spreading from person to person through aerosols? I would say definitively not,\ " Loeb said.   Government guidelines in Canada recommend that people stay at least two metres away from others as part of physical distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. (Gary Moore/CBC) If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted. \"The reason we know that is because all around the world we have hundreds of health-care workers who are taking care of patients wearing regular masks,\ " she said. \"If this were airborne —  if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles  —  all those health-care workers would be getting sick.\ " The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious. Infection control guidelines do recommend extra personal protective equipment (including N-95 respirators) to protect against airborne transmission for health-care workers performing procedures that generate high concentrations of aerosolized particles, such as intubations, on COVID-19 patients, McGeer said.    Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests But even in that scenario, the degree to which those particles are infectious hasn't been yet proven — and it a very different scenario than what people are facing in the community.   \"You and I don't have to worry walking down the street that we're going to be breathing the air of somebody who walked down the street five minutes ahead of us who had COVID-19 and didn't know it,\ " said McGeer, \"That we can be confident about.\ " Is there evidence the virus could be spread farther than 2 metres? Some studies, including Bourouiba's, show that droplets from coughs and sneezes can, in fact, travel much farther than expected. Bourouiba's high-speed imaging measurements and modelling show smaller respiratory droplets don't behave like individual droplets but  are in a turbulent gas cloud trapping them and carrying them forward within it. The moist environment reduces evaporation, allowing droplets of many sizes to survive much longer and travel much farther than two metres — up to seven or eight metres, in the case of a sneeze.   WATCH | Close-up view of the droplets released by a person sneezing   (Credit Lydia Bourouiba/MIT/JAMA Networks) She said the research \"is about revealing what you cannot see with the naked eye.\" A more recent Canadian study used a \"cough chamber\" to show that if someone coughs without covering their mouth, droplets from the cough are still travelling at a speed of about one kilometre per hour when they hit the two-metre edge of the chamber. Within the chamber, droplets remained suspended for up to three minutes.   WATCH | The speed and distance travelled by droplets from a cough   Dr. Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who co-authored the study, said it \"gives you a sense of what the possibilities are,\ " but noted that the researchers, who were studying flu patients, detected very little virus in the droplets. What does that say about the 2-metre guideline? Bourouiba says her research points to the potential for exposure beyond two metres from someone who is coughing and sneezing. As she wrote in the journal JAMA Insights in March, that means it's \"vitally important\" for health care workers to wear high-grade personal protective equipment in the form of respirators even if they're farther than two metres away from infected patients.    However, she does think two metres can be far enough for healthy people in the general public in most environments, since breathing and talking don't propel droplets and surrounding cloud too far. Mubareka stands by the two-metre guideline despite the findings of her cough chamber study. Despite dramatic images of respiratory droplets being propelled from someone's nose and mouth, it's not yet clear how many of them contain virus and how many are infectious. Second OpinionShould masks be mandatory in public to stop the spread of COVID-19? \"And that's really the key variable — that's what really determines your risk,\ " she said. \"Those are the kinds of things we haven't been able to measure.\ " That may change, she added, with the recent invention of particle samplers designed specifically for viruses. Loeb of McMaster, notes that a cough chamber and similar laboratory setups are highly artificial settings and controlled environments. \"They're basically saying what's theoretically possible,\" he said. \"I think those are provocative and those are hypothesis- generating, but then they need to be tested in the field.\" Loeb is running such a field test himself — a randomized controlled trial of the use of medical versus N95 masks among health care workers to see if there is a difference in the transmission of COVID-19. But are coughing and sneezing all we need to worry about? That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.   Even though researchers aren't sure exactly how people without symptoms transmit the disease, the new evidence has prompted both U.S. and Canadian officials to suggest apparently healthy people wear masks in public to protect others —  \"because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau famously explained. \"People generate particles when they're talking, singing, breathing —  so you don't have to necessarily be coughing,\ " Mubareka said. \"It's just that maybe the dispersion is a little bit more limited.\"   WATCH | The droplets produced when someone speaks with, and without, a mask This video, from a study published in April 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, uses laser light scattering to show droplets produced when someone speaks. 0:42   A recent brief video and report by U.S. National Institutes of Health researchers used lasers to show that droplets projected less than 10 centimetres when someone says the phrase \"Stay healthy.\ " It found the louder someone spoke, the more droplets were emitted. But they were dramatically reduced if a damp washcloth  — a stand-in for a mask — was placed over the speaker's mouth. So what about using masks to curb the spread of COVID-19? Studies have already provided evidence that the rate at which sick people shed the virus into their surroundings is reduced when they wear a mask.   Other studies, such as a 2009 paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, use imaging to show how wearing a mask while coughing reduces the jet of air that's normally directed forward and down. A surgical mask \"effectively blocks the forward momentum of the cough jet and its aerosol content,\" the study found. Some does leak out the sides, top and bottom, but without much momentum. A 2009 study by researchers in the U.S. and Singapore uses schlieren imaging to show airflow from a person's mouth a) without a mask b) with a medical mask and c) with an N95 mask. (Gary S. Settles/Penn State University/Journal of the Royal Society Interface) The World Health Organization recommends that people wear masks if they are coughing and sneezing or if they are caring for someone who is sick. It notes that studies haven't been conducted yet on whether or not transmission is reduced when healthy people wear masks in public, but it encourages countries to look into that.   Many governments haven't waited. Los Angeles, Italy and Austria are among the places that have begun requiring customers to wear masks while shopping.    To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by clicking here. 
  A day at the office for virologist Darryl Falzarano includes donning two layers of rubber gloves, a sealed body suit and an astronaut-like helmet, then taking a shower every time he steps outside the lab. The strict safety protocols are necessary to handle potentially lethal pathogens, and to develop vaccines that could stop them. Falzarano is the lead investigator for a Saskatoon team tackling the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month.  It has infected almost 6,000 people, and killed more than 130, and has spread to more than a dozen countries including Canada. In a rare opportunity, Falzarano escorted CBC News inside a containment lab at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) on the University of Saskatchewan campus. VIDO-InterVac is one of the largest, most advanced infectious disease research sites in the world and the lab is in the second-highest category of safety; biosafety level 3 is for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease by inhalation.   Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America.    (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Falzarano is the lead investigator in the search for a vaccine for the coronavirus. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) Researchers have already started preliminary work on a vaccine, using what they've learned in the past from other strains of coronaviruses. The handful of new coronavirus cases in Canada will likely speed up their work, Falzarano says.  VIDO-InterVac has requested a sample from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario. Researchers also ordered ingredients to build their own synthetic version of the coronavirus, using genome sequencing information from China. But making their own would take weeks. Getting a sample of the virus \"is a lot faster than reconstructing it ourselves,\ " Falzarano said.   His goal is to create a vaccine prototype within six to eight weeks, to be followed by animal testing.   Scientists at a Saskatoon lab are part of a global effort to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 2:34 Can't be rushed The 285,000-square foot research facility can house large animals, like bison and cattle, for testing. Scientists at VIDO-InterVac recently developed a vaccine for a coronavirus that killed 10 million pigs in North America, and Falzarano uses alpacas to test vaccines that would combat the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. For this latest coronavirus, Falzarano expects to test a vaccine on ferrets, as researchers did with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that infected about 8,000 people during the global outbreak of 2003.   Human trials for this latest coronavirus are at least a year away.  Falzarano cautions that some things can't be rushed. The VIDO-InterVac team has 50 scientists from 26 countries. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) \"Everyone can work as hard as they can, and as fast as they can, but certain processes take a certain amount of time and it's really hard to work faster than that,\ " he said. The team's research is part of a global effort says VIDO-InterVac executive director Volker Gerdts.   \"I wouldn't say it's a race. I mean, right now, this disease is really a concern to everyone on this planet,\ " Gerdts said, adding that his team will share their findings with other scientists. PhD student Swarali Kulkarni has been working on vaccine development for camels to thwart the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another strain of coronavirus, from camels to humans.   (Bonnie Allen/CBC) 'Prepare for the worst' Researchers at VIDO-InterVac worked on a potential vaccine for SARS in 2003. But when cases disappeared, the funding dried up. Research never advanced to human trials. Falzarano says researchers have to tackle this latest coronavirus as though it could turn into a pandemic. \"We don't know that this is a once-and-done scenario, so I think you always have to prepare for the worst case scenario,\" he said. Level 3 containment facilities require all of the air, water and waste to be treated before leaving the building.   (Don Somers/CBC) Falzarano says he doesn't think a SARS vaccine, if it had been developed, would be effective on this one.   However, those three strains of coronovirus that can be deadly to humans have underscored the need for a \"pan-coronavirus vaccine.\ " That's the ultimate goal of this research team. Scientists propose using structural biology and protein engineering to develop wide-serving vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. The lab has 'critical, very sophisticated infrastructure to prevent the escape of any infectious materials,' said biosafety officer Tracey Thue.   (Don Somers/CBC) Limited capacity VIDO-InterVac's $18 million annual costs are funded mostly by Ottawa and the province. A vaccine development project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the early phases, then millions as development nears the manufacturing phase. VIDO-InterVac is both a research and development centre, but work can stall when it's time to manufacture a vaccine, because of limited capacity.   \"We don't have capacity in the country, or not as much as we used to have,\ " Gerdts said.  \"So when these situations like this one arise, we have to go to other countries to get our technologies manufactured in those countries.  So it's really a bottleneck for public research like ours.\" Gerdts wants to attract more government funding for VIDO-InterVac to add manufacturing into its operation.

A health worker rests her back against a wall at a hospital outside Buenos Aires, where health workers protested the lack of protective equipment and demanded tests for personnel after several of their colleagues were infected with COVID-19. (Agustin Marcarian/Reuters) A week after their mother died of COVID-19, family still doesn't know where her body is A full week after Barbara Paquette died of COVID-19 at the long-term care facility at Montreal's LaSalle Hospital, her family still has no idea where her body is. Wendy Paquette, her daughter, said not knowing the answer is preventing her from sleeping. \"Where is our mom? Is she in a refrigerated truck? A crematorium?\ " she said. \"It's nightmarish. I can't get the vision of the truck out of my head.\" The LaSalle Hospital residence is one of the CHSLDs (centres d'hébergement de soins de longue durée) in Quebec listed as being in a critical situation, with more than 50 per cent of its residents having tested positive for COVID-19. Guillaume Bérubé, a spokesperson for the health agency for the region, confirmed refrigerated trucks have been installed outside the LaSalle, Douglas and Lakeshore hospitals, but would not confirm whether the trucks are being used to store bodies now. Bérubé said the normal procedure is to inform the family immediately following a death and to ask if they have a contract with a funeral home before the body is moved to the morgue. Either the hospital administration or the funeral home then calls the family to make further arrangements. However, Paquette said when staff called to inform them of their mother's death, they were told Health Canada would be the one issuing the death certificate and that the family would be contacted. In the confusion surrounding this pandemic, it now appears the family either misunderstood or were misinformed by the person who called them. \"It's very disturbing for us to even imagine that she's somewhere in a refrigerated truck waiting. We don't like to think of it like that, but it can very well be the reality,\ " Paquette said.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made the announcement this morning, after the release of detailed statistical information showing B.C. has so far succeeded in reducing the number of cases and avoided overwhelming the health-care system. Examples of activities that could return in a few weeks include elective surgeries, as well as changes that would help reactivate sectors of the economy. However, Henry cautioned that significant restrictions would still be in place for some time — likely until a vaccine has been developed for the virus — and that B.C.'s continued success in avoiding a large outbreak would rely on public health measures rather than developing herd immunity. Health officers also are concerned about a second wave of the virus returning in the fall, and have begun ordering more ventilators and adding to the number of acute care spaces in the province's hospitals as a precautionary measure. Read more about the situation in B.C.   Trudeau announces billions in aid for energy, rural business and arts sectors Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $1.7 billion to clean up orphan wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, as well as aid for rural businesses and people working in the arts and culture sectors. The aid to clean up orphan and abandoned wells is expected to help maintain 5,200 jobs in Alberta alone — earning praise from Premier Jason Kenney. Trudeau also announced that Ottawa will establish a $750-million emissions reduction fund, with a focus on methane, to create jobs through efforts to cut pollution. The fund includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador. Here are some of the other areas that will receive aid from the federal government:  $962 million for regional development agencies to help smaller employers in rural areas that do not have access to traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions. $270 million for a program for entrepreneurial and industrial research. $500 million to support Canadians who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: \"Although self-checkout allows you to distance from others, it also requires touching more surfaces,\" said Siyun Wang, associate professor of food safety engineering at the University of British Columbia's faculty of land and food systems. But Wang said the risk of infection at the grocery store is low, if you \"go where there are fewer people and shop efficiently, because person-to-person contact is the No. 1 concern.\" She also said it's good to minimize the amount of time you spend in the store and to use a touchless payment method. \"In both cases, consumers should be wiping their hands with a disinfectant wipe before they leave the store at the exit, and then again when they come home, and again after they put the groceries away when they get home,\" said Jeffrey Farber, director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety and a professor at the University of Guelph. He also said everyone should wash their hands before they eat. Read more answers to audience questions about COVID-19   THE SCIENCE Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests The push to start measuring COVID-19 immunity is gaining steam, with several provinces hinting at plans to roll out blood tests that could pave the way for a return to some semblance of normal everyday life. Serology tests measure the antibodies that appear in the blood after someone has battled an infection — including those who don't even know they had COVID-19 because they didn't meet testing criteria, didn't seek care or had mild or no symptoms. This data is important for policy makers deciding when to ease restrictions, said epidemiologist Patrick Saunders-Hastings, director of life sciences and environmental health at Gevity Consulting Inc. Without it, our picture of COVID-19's spread in Canada remains incomplete — diagnostic laboratory tests now in use largely focus on high-risk groups and only capture people actively infected with the virus. \"That's where serological testing comes in,\" said Saunders-Hastings. \"We just can't — won't — get those counts from the traditional laboratory testing.\ " Another big question it could help address is: When can physical distancing measures be lifted? Simply put, a return to normal is contingent on finding as many active and resolved COVID-19 cases as possible. Those who are immune can help those who are vulnerable because they won't unknowingly spread the virus, said Saunders-Hastings. AND FINALLY... A 'beacon of hope' along a Nova Scotia highway A massive, glowing heart built as a tribute to front-line workers can be spotted just past the on-ramp from Hammonds Plains Road overlooking the northbound lanes of Highway 102 in Bedford, N.S. (Submitted by Ed McHugh) Perched atop a rocky cliff on the edge of a busy highway just outside Halifax is a massive glowing red heart. It was placed there by a group of Bedford, N.S., residents as a tribute to front-line workers and a symbol of community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The location of the heart may be familiar to locals as the home of Charlie, an underwhelming and endearingly unremarkable roadside Christmas tree that has delighted commuters every holiday season for the past 20 years. Ed McHugh, whose family decorates the tree on the edge of his property, recently teamed up with a few friends to give Charlie a cliffmate — including Ross Lloy, who built the heart using wood and red Christmas tube lights. They dubbed the heart Valery, a name that has Latin origins meaning brave, strong and health. \"People need some good news. I'm not trying to trivialize ... how serious the situation is at all, but people need to see signs that other people care,\" said McHugh, whose wife, Shelly, is a nurse who came out of retirement to help during the pandemic.

  It will still take at least a year before a vaccine is available for the novel coronavirus, but B.C.'s provincial health officer says a framework is ready for who will get priority immunization. Dr. Bonnie Henry said a vaccine rollout is part of the province's pandemic strategy, and there are plans across the country for mass vaccination clinics related to COVID-19. \"We've been thinking about that quite a bit ... It can happen quite quickly,\ " Henry said during her daily briefing on Tuesday. \"I would see people like health-care workers being first in line for the vaccine, as well as our seniors and elders, as well as people who are immunocompromised or have underlying conditions that make them more at risk.\ " Watch | Dr. Bonnie Henry explains how a coronavirus vaccine would roll out Although a vaccination against coronavirus does not exist, B.C. has already planning for when it does become available. 1:17 The priority will be immunizing those who are most at risk of infection, and it will take months before the vaccine is deployed across the province, Henry said. B.C. records 1 more death from COVID-19, bringing the total to 87 She added that she does not foresee COVID-19 vaccinations being mandatory. 
  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"
  Compared to the jump of 25 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, the eight cases announced on Sunday might have caused some Manitobans to breathe a sigh of relief. But the province's top doctor says the total number of cases related to the coronavirus shouldn't be the only thing you pay attention to. \"This is the issue with our total numbers is that they can only go up, so we will expect them to go up,\" chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin said at a news conference on Sunday. \"That's not the only indication of how we're doing against this virus.\ " Roussin said other figures — ones that show how many people have recovered from COVID-19, or how quickly new cases are being detected — are what can help flesh out the bigger picture of how the virus is spreading in Manitoba. \"An important number to look at, that we're going to start trying to find a way to report, is the rate of increase,\" he said. \"Because that's what's going to tell us what's flattening our curve or not.\"   A COVID-19 glossary: What the terms mean and some subtle differences  2 Manitobans recovered Roussin said two Manitobans, out of the total 72 cases detected in the province, have recovered from the virus so far. He said that's another number he expects to see go up. Roussin also spoke about a group of Manitoba researchers looking into the possibility that a drug used to treat malaria could be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. WATCH | Dr. Brent Roussin on the Manitoba clinical trial testing if a malaria drug could help COVID-19 patients : Chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin talks about a new Manitoba clinical trial looking at the effectiveness of using hydroxychloroquine, which has been used for malaria and other conditions, to treat COVID-19. 1:16 Officials are still looking into the new cases announced Sunday to determine where those people got the virus and whether they could have passed it to anyone else. Roussin said there's still no evidence of community spread, since all cases so far were found to be linked to travel or close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. One of Manitoba's COVID-19 patients is in an intensive care unit, and another has been admitted to hospital, Roussin said. Manitoba now has 72 probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of Mar. 29, 2020. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC) The total number of deaths from the virus reported in Manitoba remains at one: a Winnipeg woman in her 60s, who died after she was admitted to an intensive care unit in critical condition. Too early to see if curve flattening Manitoba Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa said so far, Manitoba's COVID-19 curve seems fairly low still. \"We know that there have been two admissions to critical care. We have had one death and we have one [other] patient in hospital right now. So that to us is pretty flat,\ " she said.   Roussin said that means it's still too early to tell what effect the province's efforts are having on the virus's spread — so Manitobans need to keep practising physical distancing.

  HIV and malaria medications are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 in B.C. as nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus provincewide. According to provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral Remdesivir — at one point used to to treat Ebola — are currently being tested on patients inside at least one facility in B.C. Outbreaks have occurred inside 12 long-term care homes in the province. \"There has been some experimental use [of the medications] all within the protocols of the international trials that we in Canada are part of,\ " Henry said at her latest coronavirus briefing on Saturday. Since mid-March, the federal government has been working with international regulators to fast track clinical trials for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says more therapeutics will be tested in the coming days and weeks as researchers look for ways to treat COVID-19 before a vaccine is produced. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) A vaccine won't be ready for up to 18 months, so researchers have been focused on using existing medications to treat COVID-19. While some patients have been undergoing the experimental treatment, the bulk of the research in B.C. has been taking place inside labs at the University of British Columbia and the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, Henry said. B.C. records 1 new death and 92 new cases on Saturday, bringing provincial total to 884 Touted by Trump, cautioned by Canada Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir have been tested overseas, particularly in China, Henry said. Early progress prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to tell a crowd of reporters that anti-malaria medications were showing \"very, very encouraging early results.\" President Donald Trump listens to coronavirus response co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx speak during a briefing on March 20. He later told reporters anti-malaria medication was showing very encouraging results for treating COVID-19 although public health officials caution citizens against taking the drugs.    (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press) Public health officials were quick to temper expectations — and urge caution — following his remarks.   Earlier this week, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Therese Tam urged Canadians not to take medication without the scientific evidence. Q&A'This isn't Halloween candy': Infectious disease specialist cautious over drugs touted as COVID-19 treatment \"It can be quite dangerous. These drugs are not without side effects. In fact, there are quite significant side effects,\" said Tam on Monday. The World Health Organization (WHO) is running a research network called Solidarity that has identified a \"vast suite of potential drug therapies and combinations\" that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Tam said part of Canada's participation in the network includes making sure patients will receive drugs supported by research.   Chief public health officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam warned Canadians that there is still no definitive scientific proof that anti-malaria medication is effective in treating COVID-19. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) In the U.S. and Canada, health officials have warned that hoarding hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 could hurt others, such as those who take the drug long-term to keep chronic inflammatory diseases like lupus under control. More therapies on the way Hydroxychloroquine is also being tested on COVID-19 patients by researchers at the University of Manitoba — a joint trial in conjunction with researchers in Alberta and Minnesota. Other labs across Canada and the U.S. have ramped up testing on a swath of new drugs in hopes of quelling the widening outbreak. CBC InvestigatesDoctors face sanctions for prescribing unproven COVID-19 drugs to friends and family, regulators warn Dr. Henry says B.C. will continue to do its part in helping determine which medications might be effective. \"Our critical care physicians are watching the data of course that's going on around the world,\ " she said. \"So there will be more use of all the potential therapeutics.\"
  Severe chills. Aches and pains. Full-body weakness. Bruce England says those intense symptoms began one night in 2003 after he'd wrapped up a shift as a Toronto paramedic.   \"I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't lift my head.  I couldn't go to the washroom,\ " he recalled. \"I just didn't have the strength. It was like being hit by a two-by-four and not being able to move.\ " England called his team to report his sudden illness. Soon after, he says two fellow paramedics arrived at his home in full protective suits to take him to a hospital — where he was whisked right into an isolation room. His eventual diagnosis? SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, the condition caused by a coronavirus that spread through much of the world in the early 2000s, killing hundreds of people and afflicting thousands more. As concern grows over the recent outbreak of another newly discovered strain of coronavirus, with two cases now identified in Toronto — one officially confirmed, and one presumed due to the results of  an early lab test — England says his experience offers lessons for protecting Canadian front-line workers from a new but familiar threat. Transparency, communication, and access to personal protective equipment are all key to ensuring the safety of paramedics and hospital staff, he said, echoing the recent comments of Canadian health officials who have stressed that protections are indeed in place. \"To me , there's no question, we're going to have more patients,\ " England warned. \"And I worry about the health-care workers. They are putting themselves in harm's way.\ " Hear from Bruce England, a retired Toronto paramedic who contracted SARS in 2003: Retired paramedic Bruce England says it was like 'being hit by a two-by-four' when he contracted SARS during the 2003 outbreak. 3:13 Lessons learned from SARS Rising concern over the impact of a coronavirus in Canada follows news on Saturday of the country's first presumptive case. That since-confirmed case involves a man in his 50s who recently travelled back to Toronto from Wuhan, China — the city thought to be the origin point for the new virus — who is currently in stable condition at Sunnybrook Hospital.   Health officials now believe his wife is the country's likely second case; she's currently in self-isolation, with less severe symptoms that haven't required hospital care, according to provincial health officials. Another 19 people in the province are also under investigation for possible infection, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer, on Monday. While Canada grapples with a number of infected patients that could potentially rise, Chinese health commission officials said the number of deaths from the virus in Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — has climbed to 76, with four deaths elsewhere in the country, including one in Beijing, and several thousand others infected. Ontario's chief medical officer says preparedness is 'well ahead' of 2003 and SARS 3:15 During the SARS outbreak, which also originated in China, England said there was a lack of details flowing from both Chinese officials and medical professionals in Canada. \"I think back then what we didn't have was transparency,\ " he said. \"We weren't sharing information quickly.\" 19 in Ontario being investigated for coronavirus after 1 case confirmed, 1 presumedAnalysisWhy Canada's 1st suspected coronavirus case is 'a world of difference' from SARS England stressed the need for ongoing communication between medical professionals and the public, along with ensuring there are adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for personnel who may transporting or treating patients with the new coronavirus. Previous research also suggests the added importance of isolating patients and implementing hospital-based screening measures. A nurse in protective gear talks on her phone near an ambulance in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province on Sunday.

Second Opinion'It plays to our worst fears': Coronavirus misinformation fuelled by social mediaToronto Public Health says it's ready for infectious diseases like coronavirus Early on in the Toronto epidemic, undetected patients went on to infect others in several different hospitals, even after increased infection control measures were taken. The province later halted between-hospital patient transfers, created separate SARS hospital units, minimized visitor access, and establishing a screening process.   \"Because the spread of SARS in Toronto was largely restricted to the hospital setting, these precautions were effective in controlling the outbreak,\" the report notes. Protections, 'screening measures' in place In recent days, health officials have stressed efforts are being made to ensure there isn't a repeat of a SARS-level outbreak in Canada, which chiefly affected health care workers and patients.   For one thing, the province has implemented \"enhanced screening measures\" at all emergency medical services' communication centres to identify potential cases of the coronavirus before dispatching paramedics, said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health in Ontario, during a Monday news conference. China's coronavirus quarantine like using an 'atomic bomb' to deal with outbreak, expert saysCoronavirus in Canada : What are the next steps to contain the disease here? Travis Kann, a spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Health, also told CBC Toronto on Tuesday in an emailed statement that hospitals have been directed to use screening measures for all patients with symptoms of the coronavirus who have travelled to Wuhan within 14 days before symptom onset, coupled with subsequent testing for any patient who meets those criteria. Guidance around the use of personal protective equipment has also been provided to the province's health system, Kann continued.

During the emergency call from the man who has since been confirmed as infected with the new coronavirus, for instance, paramedics did use \"full personal protective equipment,\ " according to Dr. Rita Shahin, Toronto's associate medical officer of health. Toronto Mayor John Tory is among the officials trying to quell fears over a new coronavirus, saying protections are in place for front-line workers. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News) Looking back on his time during the SARS outbreak , England wishes a similar procedure had been in place then. Protective equipment procedures weren't typically in place during those early days, he noted, and he believes he caught his illness from a patient in a hospital about two weeks before his symptoms showed up.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke about the struggles of Canadians abroad and the need to step up testing for COVID-19 on Thursday, a day after announcing an $82-billion COVID-19 response package that includes measures ranging from wage subsidies and income supports to a temporary boost to the child benefit program. Canada has more than 800 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, an illness caused by the novel coronavirus that first emerged in China. The number of cases has been increasing daily, sparking concern about the capacity of Canada's health-care systems and prompting provinces to cancel classes, call for the closure of some businesses and introduce rules to promote social distancing. The federal government is suspending passport services except in the cases of urgent travel; such as serious illness, the death of a friend or family member, humanitarian work or in the event the person would otherwise lose a job or business.  Service Canada says anyone who does not meet the criteria for urgent travel — or is experiencing symptoms such as a fever, coughing, having trouble breathing — will have to wait. Ontario on Thursday announced its second death from COVID-19, Alberta reported its first, while B.C. reported one additional death, bringing its total to eight.    Canada's top doctor told reporters Thursday that officials are concerned about the increase of cases in Ontario, particularly three cases being investigated as coming from community transmission.

Prepare to see COVID-19 cases rising. That doesn't mean social distancing has failed COVID-19 isn't just testing governments, it's testing citizens   For most of those people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. The vast majority of people recover from the virus, but some people who are infected — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — are at higher risk of facing a more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. As the worldwide death toll crept toward 10,000 and the number of infections topped 220,000 (including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered), officials around the world urged people to come together, while staying physically apart. \"When you love someone, you should avoid taking them in your arms,\ " French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said in parliament. \"It's counterintuitive  and it's painful; the psychological consequences, the way we are living, are very disturbing — but it's what we must do.\"   Here's what's happening in the provinces and territories British Columbia on Wednesday declared a state of emergency, a move that allows the province to do things like secure supply chains.

Dr.  Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, said the coronavirus vaccine that is currently in a clinical trial in the United States will take at least 12 months to be approved. At the same time, the State Department issued a new alert, urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas. And the White House announced Trump will cancel an in-person meeting of G7 leaders at Camp David in June and will hold a videoconference instead.

Earlier Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress to move quickly to pass a massive $1 trillion US economic relief measure by early next week, saying he expects bipartisan support for the bill to get cash payments to Americans. Trump signed an aid package — which the Senate approved earlier Wednesday — that will guarantee sick leave for workers who fall ill. The president this week also tapped his authority under the 70-year-old Defence Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies. Yet he seemed to minimize the urgency of the decision, later tweeting that he \"only signed the Defence Production Act to combat the [virus] should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.\ " \"Hopefully there will be no need,\ " he added, \"but we are all in this TOGETHER!\ " The U.S. Centers for Disease Control as of Wednesday was reporting 7,038 cases and 97 deaths, but those figures are updated once daily and lag some other tallies — including a Johns Hopkins University tracker that puts the U.S. figure at 9,415 cases, with more than 150 dead and more than 100 recovered.

Italy's death toll surpassed China's on Thursday, in a stark illustration of how the outbreak has pivoted toward Europe and the United States. With a population of 60 million, Italy has recorded at least 3,405 deaths as of Thursday, or roughly 150 more than in China — a country with a population over 20 times larger. Also on Thursday, a northern Italian town whose cemetery has been overwhelmed began loading bodies into trucks to move them to neighbouring provinces. Italy reached its bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, recorded no new infections  —  a sign that the communist country's draconian lockdowns were a powerful method to stop the virus' spread.   A woman wearing a protective mask walks past a banner thanking health-care workers hanging at one of the entrances of the Timone hospital and the IHU Mediterranee Infection Institute in Marseille, southeastern France. (Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images) The United Nations and Italian health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy's high toll, key among them its large elderly population, who are particularly susceptible to developing serious complications from the virus. Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan's and the vast majority of Italy's dead — 87 per cent — were over age 70. In addition, virtually all of Italy's dead had one or more underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension or renal insufficiency.   Italy still has far fewer confirmed cases than China — 41,035 as of Thursday, compared to more than 80,900 in China. Schools in Italy are likely to remain closed beyond April 3, Italy's education minister said on Thursday. \"As Prime Minister [Giuseppe ] Conte said, I think we are going toward an extension of the April 3 deadline,\" Lucia Azzolina told SkyTG24. Schools and universities were closed on March 5.

France's Cannes Film Festival has been postponed, following weeks of speculation over whether it would go ahead. Meanwhile, the Costa Luminosa transatlantic cruise ship, which has recorded several cases of COVID-19 among its passengers, has docked in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille on Thursday morning. More than 1,400 people, including more than 75 Canadians, are on the cruise. French authorities have allowed the ship to dock and stay up to four days under strict conditions. It is not known whether passengers will be allowed off, given the current stringent restrictions in France amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Sophiahemmet University will run a three-day pilot for 30 people at the end of March with the hope of eventually extending the course to hundreds more. Europe is scrambling to slow the spread of the virus, with countries introducing a range of measures including tighter border controls, school and business closures and plans designed to boost ailing economies. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he's confident the U.K. \"can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks,\" and that Britain is in talks to buy a coronavirus antibody test \"as simple as a pregnancy test.\ " The British government previously announced it plans to introduce a bill in Parliament later Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. The bill gives police and immigration officers powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health. The Bank of England also slashed its key interest rate to 0.1 per cent  —  its lowest-ever level  — amid global economic turmoil sparked by the pandemic.

  In Alberta, you can buy a T-shirt printed with the image of the province's chief medical officer of health and the slogan: \"What would Dr. (Deena) Hinshaw do?\ " That's what sociologist Cary Wu is talking about. \"Government and health officials need to rely on people's trust to implement effective responses,\" said Wu from York University in Toronto. \"If people do not trust, it's very difficult to promote collective action.\ " Wu is one of several Canadian researchers who have received grants to study the relationship between COVID-19 and social trust — an aspect of public health that doesn't involve labs or quarantines but is every bit as important. \"It's really important that we can turn to experts and trust what they're saying, that we're able to separate information from misinformation, and that we know who we can depend on for good guidance,\ " said Eric Kennedy, a York University \"disaster historian\" who's also researching the issue. Public health crises stress public trust in at least four ways, said Wu. Trust in fellow citizens, trust in politicians, trust in health care and trust in perceived outsiders are all affected. \"Maybe a public health crisis could lead to people's distrust of people. Or it could create solidarity and create more trust. We don't really know.\"   Anti-social behaviours are much more in the minority. It's much more common for people's behaviour to come together.- Eric Kennedy Kennedy said research from past disaster responses is encouraging. \"There have been myths surrounding disasters — social breakdown or looting or conflict. \"What we've seen from lots of different studies is that usually those anti-social behaviours are much more in the minority. It's much more common for people's behaviour to come together.\ " Both Wu and Kennedy are in the midst of extensive survey and interview programs. Kennedy has already received some responses to his survey, which includes questions about knowledge of and responses to the pandemic, as well as attitudes toward national and international organizations and information sources. It also asks how respondents feel they've been treated by other people. A culture of trust?   While it's much too soon to draw conclusions, early responses suggest Canadians are doing what they've been asked, Kennedy said \"By and large, Canadians are reporting taking a lot of the steps that they've been called upon to take,\" he said. Wu agrees that Canada's civic culture remains cohesive. \"Canadians, in general, have higher trust than other countries,\" he said. \"Canadians are more likely to follow social distancing requirements. People perform better in terms of complying with policy matters.\" An Angus Reid online poll of nearly 1,600 Canadians late last week appeared to confirm that. Two-thirds of respondents said they trusted information from the federal government — an increase of nine points since early March. Just over half of respondents in the United States said the same in a recent Gallup poll.

They hope data on social trust from before, during and after the pandemic will help officials to refine their approach to keeping the public onside. \"We want to be able to feed some of that advice back to help support them in being more trustworthy,\ " Kennedy said. \"We want to understand what folks are perceiving. If we can understand where Canadians are, we'll better understand how they are perceiving the epidemic and how we can respond.\"   The flurry of daily pandemic data can be overwhelming. Here's how to make sense of it
  A clinic designed to vaccinate children under the age of two opened in Ottawa Tuesday to ensure babies get routine immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian Paediatric Society has been calling on doctors to continue providing in-person inoculations for infants and toddlers as many family physicians switch to phone consultations in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious disease physician at CHEO and chair of Immunize Canada, strongly encourages infant vaccinations during the pandemic because other illnesses could spread once physical distancing measures are relaxed. \"It is imperative that the interruption of routine immunizations be minimized, particularly in young infants and vulnerable populations,\ " she said in a news release from CHEO on Tuesday. The hospital, along with Ottawa Public Health and other health care providers \"saw the need to provide another option and reduce barriers\" to allow families to access primary immunizations for babies, the news release from CHEO said. \"Access to [vaccinations] may be difficult for some families and community pediatricians fully support any effort to reduce the barriers in receiving these immunizations,\" said Kathy Keely, a community pediatrician in Ottawa. Why the 'Kids Come First' health team wants to make sure kids under 2 don't miss out on their first vaccinations during this pandemic. 8:44 The Children's Immunization Clinic will provide a number of vaccines to babies and toddlers, including:   The five-in-one vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B) given at two, four, six and 18 months. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given at two, four and 12 months. Rotavirus vaccine given at two, four and six months. Meningococcal conjugate type C given at 12 months. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine given at 12 months. Chicken pox vaccine given at 15 months.   Families who need vaccinations should first contact their primary care provider, CHEO said. If an appointment cannot be arranged, families can call Ottawa Public Health at 613-580-6744 to book an appointment at the immunization clinic. While the clinic is only for children two and under, older children and adolescents including newcomers to Canada who did not receive their primary series of vaccines are also eligible to get vaccinations at the clinic, CHEO said. 
  University of Manitoba researchers are testing a potential treatment they hope will help fight COVID-19 — and they think they may have some results from their trial in as little as a month. Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said preliminary studies have suggested hydroxychloroquine —  a drug approved by Health Canada to prevent and treat malaria since the 1950s — can be repurposed to reduce the severity of COVID-19. Those preliminary studies point to the possibility hydroxychloroquine may lessen the effects of the illness, such as cough, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia in the lungs, and slow its spread. \"There's a lot of scared people. There's a lot of emotion around COVID-19,\" Zarychanski said, adding scientists are not yet certain of hydroxychloroquine's benefits. The drug will be studied in a trial with participants who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who live with someone else who has. The trial will also be open to health-care workers who were exposed to patients who have tested positive, the U of M said in a Wednesday press release. \"This is the first of six trials that will offer potentially effective therapies to Manitobans at all stages or severity of the COVID-19 disease instead of shuttering up,\" Zarychanski said. Manitoba sees its largest 1-day jump in COVID-19 cases, bringing total to 35U of Manitoba health sciences students step up to volunteer in fight against COVID-19 For COVID-19-positive people, the hope is that the drug may limit symptoms and shorten the amount of time the illness persists, he said. The trial, which began recruiting participants on Wednesday, has two goals, according to the study's website:   Determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent development of COVID-19 after exposure to the novel coronavirus that causes the illness. Test whether early hydroxychloroquine therapy with people showing COVID-19 symptoms can prevent the illness from progressing, or symptoms from worsening.   \"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the healthcare system.\" So far, care for people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been dependent on using ventilators until they get better. As a critical care doctor, Dr. Ryan Zarychanski hopes the clinical drugs will work alongside traditional methods such as ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients. (Ilustration by Isabelle Plamondon/Radio-Canada) \"The best way for us to know if a therapy works is to study it, but study it quickly in people who might benefit,\ "   Zarychanski said.   People have been cautioned against taking any medications outside supervised studies, though, after U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters last week hydroxychloroquine had shown \"very, very encouraging early results\" in fighting COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, quickly noted that officials are trying to strike a balance between making the potential therapy available to physicians and ensuring it is safe and effective through clinical trials. Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19Arizona man dead, wife in hospital after ingesting chloroquine over coronavirus fears \"I think what happened south of us is that perhaps a very senior leader within their country made public claims that the drug was effective, when in all honesty we're not certain if it's of benefit to patients,\ " Zarychanski said, adding that's exactly what his clinical study is setting out to determine. \"The only way though we can understand whether it's beneficial is within the context of very carefully conducted and monitored clinical trials.\ " He doesn't believe there would be significant short-term side effects as a result of taking the drug as part of the clinical trial. \"It can interact with other drugs and it may have some short-term cardiac issues, and so we make sure we understand what other drugs people are on before they sign up for the trial,\" he said. In the long run, it is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, although the short five-day trial should be \"very safe,\" he said. ' Moved mountains' to start study quickly \"This is a very exciting trial because it's not just about treating individuals but it's about trying to sort of flatten that epidemiologic curve,\ " Zarychanski said. \"We're  not only offering the therapy to the positive people but to the family members of those positive people who then could pass it on to other people.\" To provide a control group, half of participants will be given the actual drug, and the other half will receive a placebo.   Zarychanski said the study — being conducted through the University of Manitoba, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta, and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre — is remarkable for how quickly it's progressed. \"The University Manitoba has moved mountains over the course of one week,\" he said. \"In the setting of a pandemic and the need to bring drug trials urgently to the population, we've stepped up.\ " It usually takes six months up to a year to get clinical trails going. In this case, Zarychanski said it took only five days to get the green light from Health Canada, ethics approval, staff in place and a website running. Scientists are relying on the media and word of mouth to recruit participants. Anyone who believes they may be eligible can fill out screening questions and provide consent through the study's website. Because COVID-19 is highly contagious, participants won't visit the researchers in a lab setting.   Instead, the drug or placebo will be shipped to the participant the day after they are enrolled in the trial, the U of Manitoba said. The study is open to those who researchers can deliver the drug to within 24 hours. 
  Quebec's pediatricians are backing the government's plan to gradually reopen schools, saying unless that happens well before September, children and teens risk suffering further \"collateral damage\" from prolonged isolation and the loss of the social safety net that schools and daycares provide. In an open letter released Thursday, the association said that for children from underprivileged families, in particular, there are enormous costs to keeping them out of school and daycare. \"Knowing that, for lots of families, their financial status is not very good now, we're worried that kids are not nourished as well as they should be,\" Dr. Marc Lebel, the association president, told CBC Montreal's Daybreak Friday. About 240,000 students in Quebec depend on the breakfast programs of their schools, he said. The lunch and snacks provided by early childhood education centres (CPEs) and other daycares also ensure young children get balanced, nutritious food. Just as serious, Lebel said, is the increased risk of abuse. The association notes there have been far fewer reports of alleged abuse to the youth protection authorities in recent weeks. \"That doesn't mean that there are no kids that are mistreated,\ " said Lebel. In the association's letter, he and other pediatricians say \"a good number of children are sitting on a time bomb,\" as being in close quarters with stressed-out parents \"in imposed isolation, 24 hours a day, without jobs and without income, can only multiply the risks of domestic violence.\"  Because they have no contact with their teachers and resource workers, some children might be at greater risk of falling through the cracks, Lebel told Daybreak. Dr. Marc Lebel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Sainte-Justine Hospital's research centre and president of Quebec's association of pediatricians, said the prolonged period of isolation due to the pandemic has put many children at higher risk of falling through the cracks. (CHU Sainte-Justine research centre) Premier François Legault has  said the province is looking at a plan to start reopening schools later this spring, in a gradual way and on a voluntary basis. He has reiterated that all decisions will be made in collaboration with health authorities, as they continue to study the spread of the virus over the coming days. Lebel said it is important the change be gradual, suggesting that schools might need to keep their classrooms at half-capacity, at first. As schools do reopen, parents who are immuno-suppressed, older or have other risk factors may want to consider keeping their children home, he said. He agreed with the premier, however, that children are generally unlikely to get very sick from exposure to the virus. Will herd immunity save us? Your COVID-19 questions answered \"The primary goal of confinement was effectively to protect the elders, the people who are most at risk of complications from the disease,\" said Lebel. \"From a scientific point of view, COVID-19, in the vast majority of children and adolescents, is not at all a severe disease.\ " Lebel said it could take anywhere from a year to 18 months before a vaccine becomes available, making exposure to the virus, and the gradual move towards herd immunity, the only option for now. Province needs clear strategy Dr. David Buckeridge, an epidemiology professor at McGill University, said before any schools or businesses reopen, the province needs to ensure it has a clear testing strategy in place. In an interview on Daybreak, Buckeridge called for a staged approach, one which would mean looking at what happens in regions where there have been smaller outbreaks first. Why ending Quebec's COVID-19 lockdown could mean freedom for some, but not allWith few COVID-19 cases, eastern Quebec seeks balance between tourism and public health \"No matter how you go about it, it means you're infecting people and placing them at risk,\" said Buckeridge.  \"So the real challenge is … how do we get there with the minimum amount of people being seriously ill and minimal societal disruption.\ " Even if the province decides to reopen region by region, Buckeridge said, public health authorities need to be cautious about how they reopen and how they go about testing people in those regions. \"You don't want to open the doors entirely, but you also don't want to do tiny little steps, you want to think it through,\ " he said. \"To have an infrastructure in place to know if they've gone too far is the most important thing.\"

' A race against the disease': Canadian researchers part of global effort to develop COVID-19 vaccine On the quiet, shuttered campus of the University of Saskatchewan, Dr. Volker Gerdts and his research team are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and they are feeling the pressure to move faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. Watch | Canada's role in the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine   A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and Saskatchewan governments to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\"  Read more on this story here.

As job losses mount and self-isolation continues, half of Canadians say their mental health has gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10 per cent reporting it has deteriorated \"a lot,\" according to a new survey. Less than 20 per cent of Canadians polled reported being optimistic when asked to survey their life in the past couple of weeks, and 16 per cent described themselves as depressed, according to the online survey released Monday by the Angus Reid Institute. Despite reporting a decline in mental health, three-quarters of Canadians believe it's too soon to begin lifting restrictions on businesses and public gatherings, the survey said.  Read about the survey results here.

  A Halifax-based research company has developed a COVID-19 antibody test. MedMira hopes to be able to market it to countries ready to begin surveillance programs to find out how widespread infections are within their borders. The company developed one of the first rapid detection kits for HIV. Other Canadian companies are already making similar tests and selling them abroad. Hermes Chan, the company's co-founder, said his company is counting on two things to help it beat its competitors — speed and ease of operation. \"From taking a drop of blood specimen to complete one single test, it will take less than three minutes,\" said Chan. Similar to pregnancy test According to Chan, other tests can take 15-20 minutes to complete and some need a reader to interpret the results. MedMira's process, which is similar to a pregnancy test, registers a positive or negative result on the testing device itself. Chan said lab technicians could also perform multiple tests simultaneously, rather than having to perform them one at a time. \"Essentially you can line up 15-20 test cartridges,\ " he said. Creating the test has been lightning fast. Hermes Chan is the co-founder of MedMira.   (MedMira) Chan said he started thinking about how to adapt the company's HIV-detection device to be able to find COVID-19 antibodies just six weeks ago. \"The only different thing in there is the type of antigens that we place on our test cartridge,\ " he said. \"Everything else is the same and that's why we can actually develop this particular test in such a fast time.\" Company targeting U.S. Some countries have started to test for antibodies, or are planning to do so, but Health Canada has not approved that kind of testing in Canada. That is one of the reasons Chan is looking to the U.S. as an initial market. He said his Dartmouth facility could easily create thousands of ready-to-ship units in short order \"Today, I will say that, without any further expansion, we are looking at about 50,000 tests a week, so about 200,000 a month,\ " he said. \"With some additional equipment and expansions, we probably can double that.\" People generate antibodies to defend themselves when infected by a virus.   Being able to determine if a person has developed antibodies to a virus would tell if they were once infected and had developed immunity. Dr. Todd Hachette (Dr. Todd Hachette) According to Dr. Todd Hachette, chief of the division of microbiology at the Nova Scotia Health Authority, that kind of information would be valuable to better understand how COVID-19 has spread throughout Nova Scotia.   It could be of more practical use in subsequent waves of the virus. \"Theoretically, if we knew that the test was predictive of someone who is immune and not going to get the infection again, you could prioritize or triage health-care workers,\" said Hachette. There's also another possible use further down the line, he said. \"If and when we develop a vaccine we will be able to see how many people have been infected and help triage those who have been infected or those who have not been infected yet to get the vaccine first.\" 'Too early to know' Hachette was happy to hear a homegrown company had developed an antibody test, but remained cautious about the overall value. \"I think it's great that Nova Scotia companies are developing the capacity to produce different tests that could be of use,\" he said. \"But at this point it's too early to know where these tests can be used, and more importantly we need to make sure that the tests being produced, not only in Nova Scotia, but in all of the other regions across the world, actually work.\ " Chan is confident his test works. Even though his company hasn't turned a profit in at least five years, he said he wasn't looking at this simply as a way to make money. \"Certainly we will sell the product at a reasonable market price,\" he said.   \"We are not looking to benefit from such a horrible crisis, pandemic crisis.\" MedMira will still have to deal with regulatory hurdles wherever it tries to sell the product. It is not approved for sale in any jurisdiction.

  This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning.  If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through droplets that we spew as we breathe, talk, cough and sneeze — so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye.   That's why questions remain about the virus's transmission and what precautions need to be taken to curb its spread as governments begin to lift restrictions. Will it help if everyone wears a mask? Is keeping everyone two metres apart far enough? Some researchers aim to learn more about transmission by trying to make invisible sneezes, coughs and breaths more visible. Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal. How do scientists think COVID-19 is transmitted? According to the World Health Organization, the disease spreads primarily through tiny droplets expelled when a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 sneezes, coughs, exhales or spits while talking. They can infect another person who:   Comes into contact with those droplets through their eyes, nose or mouth (droplet transmission).    Touches objects or surfaces on which droplets have landed and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth (contact transmission).    The WHO says it's important to stay \"more than one metre away\" from a person who is sick. But the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends staying a distance of at least two metres or two arms' lengths away, not just from people who are sick but from all people you don't live with. Why is 2 metres the recommended distance for preventing transmission? Scientists in the 19th century showed respiratory droplets from a person's nose and mouth can carry micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Then, in 1934, W.F. Wells at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that large droplets (bigger than 0.1 millimetre) tended to fall and settle on the ground within a distance of two metres, while smaller droplets evaporated and the virus particles left behind could remain suspended in the air for a long time.   Wells proposed that could explain how diseases are transmitted. Since then, respiratory diseases have been divided into those transmitted via droplets (usually from close contact) and those that are airborne and can spread over longer distances, such as measles or tuberculosis.   INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday Such tiny particles are presumably pushed around by air currents, but can't move easily due to air resistance. So their actual movements haven't been well modelled or measured, said Lydia Bourouiba, professor and director of the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   \"And that's why the notion of airborne [transmission] is very murky,\" said Bourouiba, who is Canadian. Why don't experts think the virus is airborne? A pair of recent studies raised the notion of airborne transmission, but Mark Loeb, a professor at Hamilton's McMaster University who specializes in infectious disease research, cautions against putting too much stock in them.   Researchers found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in washrooms and some high-traffic areas in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and in Nebraska, and suggested it got into those areas through the air, though there was no evidence the particles were still infectious.   Loeb said that's just a \"signal\" that part of the virus was there.   \"Does it mean that COVID-19 is spreading from person to person through aerosols? I would say definitively not,\ " Loeb said.   Government guidelines in Canada recommend that people stay at least two metres away from others as part of physical distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. (Gary Moore/CBC) If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted. \"The reason we know that is because all around the world we have hundreds of health-care workers who are taking care of patients wearing regular masks,\ " she said. \"If this were airborne —  if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles  —  all those health-care workers would be getting sick.\ " The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious. Infection control guidelines do recommend extra personal protective equipment (including N-95 respirators) to protect against airborne transmission for health-care workers performing procedures that generate high concentrations of aerosolized particles, such as intubations, on COVID-19 patients, McGeer said.    Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests But even in that scenario, the degree to which those particles are infectious hasn't been yet proven — and it a very different scenario than what people are facing in the community.   \"You and I don't have to worry walking down the street that we're going to be breathing the air of somebody who walked down the street five minutes ahead of us who had COVID-19 and didn't know it,\ " said McGeer, \"That we can be confident about.\ " Is there evidence the virus could be spread farther than 2 metres? Some studies, including Bourouiba's, show that droplets from coughs and sneezes can, in fact, travel much farther than expected. Bourouiba's high-speed imaging measurements and modelling show smaller respiratory droplets don't behave like individual droplets but  are in a turbulent gas cloud trapping them and carrying them forward within it. The moist environment reduces evaporation, allowing droplets of many sizes to survive much longer and travel much farther than two metres — up to seven or eight metres, in the case of a sneeze.   WATCH | Close-up view of the droplets released by a person sneezing   (Credit Lydia Bourouiba/MIT/JAMA Networks) She said the research \"is about revealing what you cannot see with the naked eye.\" A more recent Canadian study used a \"cough chamber\" to show that if someone coughs without covering their mouth, droplets from the cough are still travelling at a speed of about one kilometre per hour when they hit the two-metre edge of the chamber. Within the chamber, droplets remained suspended for up to three minutes.   WATCH | The speed and distance travelled by droplets from a cough   Dr. Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who co-authored the study, said it \"gives you a sense of what the possibilities are,\ " but noted that the researchers, who were studying flu patients, detected very little virus in the droplets. What does that say about the 2-metre guideline? Bourouiba says her research points to the potential for exposure beyond two metres from someone who is coughing and sneezing. As she wrote in the journal JAMA Insights in March, that means it's \"vitally important\" for health care workers to wear high-grade personal protective equipment in the form of respirators even if they're farther than two metres away from infected patients.    However, she does think two metres can be far enough for healthy people in the general public in most environments, since breathing and talking don't propel droplets and surrounding cloud too far. Mubareka stands by the two-metre guideline despite the findings of her cough chamber study. Despite dramatic images of respiratory droplets being propelled from someone's nose and mouth, it's not yet clear how many of them contain virus and how many are infectious. Second OpinionShould masks be mandatory in public to stop the spread of COVID-19? \"And that's really the key variable — that's what really determines your risk,\ " she said. \"Those are the kinds of things we haven't been able to measure.\ " That may change, she added, with the recent invention of particle samplers designed specifically for viruses. Loeb of McMaster, notes that a cough chamber and similar laboratory setups are highly artificial settings and controlled environments. \"They're basically saying what's theoretically possible,\" he said. \"I think those are provocative and those are hypothesis- generating, but then they need to be tested in the field.\" Loeb is running such a field test himself — a randomized controlled trial of the use of medical versus N95 masks among health care workers to see if there is a difference in the transmission of COVID-19. But are coughing and sneezing all we need to worry about? That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.   Even though researchers aren't sure exactly how people without symptoms transmit the disease, the new evidence has prompted both U.S. and Canadian officials to suggest apparently healthy people wear masks in public to protect others —  \"because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau famously explained. \"People generate particles when they're talking, singing, breathing —  so you don't have to necessarily be coughing,\ " Mubareka said. \"It's just that maybe the dispersion is a little bit more limited.\"   WATCH | The droplets produced when someone speaks with, and without, a mask This video, from a study published in April 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, uses laser light scattering to show droplets produced when someone speaks. 0:42   A recent brief video and report by U.S. National Institutes of Health researchers used lasers to show that droplets projected less than 10 centimetres when someone says the phrase \"Stay healthy.\ " It found the louder someone spoke, the more droplets were emitted. But they were dramatically reduced if a damp washcloth  — a stand-in for a mask — was placed over the speaker's mouth. So what about using masks to curb the spread of COVID-19? Studies have already provided evidence that the rate at which sick people shed the virus into their surroundings is reduced when they wear a mask.   Other studies, such as a 2009 paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, use imaging to show how wearing a mask while coughing reduces the jet of air that's normally directed forward and down. A surgical mask \"effectively blocks the forward momentum of the cough jet and its aerosol content,\" the study found. Some does leak out the sides, top and bottom, but without much momentum. A 2009 study by researchers in the U.S. and Singapore uses schlieren imaging to show airflow from a person's mouth a) without a mask b) with a medical mask and c) with an N95 mask. (Gary S. Settles/Penn State University/Journal of the Royal Society Interface) The World Health Organization recommends that people wear masks if they are coughing and sneezing or if they are caring for someone who is sick. It notes that studies haven't been conducted yet on whether or not transmission is reduced when healthy people wear masks in public, but it encourages countries to look into that.   Many governments haven't waited. Los Angeles, Italy and Austria are among the places that have begun requiring customers to wear masks while shopping.    To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by clicking here. 
  A University of Saskatchewan research team and scientists from across the country have been awarded $1 million over two years to develop animal models and test vaccine candidates to find a vaccine for COVID-19. The project is being led by the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac), and is part of a rapid research funding initiative, designed to contribute to efforts to contain COVID-19.   PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccineSask. researchers aiming to develop a vaccine for coronavirus outbreak in China Volker Gerdts, director of VIDO-InterVac, said a race is underway to find the best animal for replicating the disease.   \"Is it mice, hamsters, or ferrets? Whichever model works best is the one we're going to use,\ " he said in a statement provided by the university.   \"Once the model is developed, we will then be able to test our vaccine candidates for effectiveness.\"   He said the virus is already being grown in VIDO-InterVac labs and the process of developing an animal model is already underway. The lab has already infected some ferrets with COVID-19. The lab's vaccine is also already being generated; Gerdts said with the money in hand, the lab can now begin testing the vaccine on animals and study the safety of the vaccine. He said once the vaccine has passed safety tests on animals, it will need to be studied in humans. Researchers also hope to better understand issues like transmission between animals, impact of age on disease and susceptibility of agricultural animals like chickens or pigs.   \"The goal is to develop a disease in these animals that is similar to humans, so that we then can use that as a read-out to show that our vaccine works, or it doesn't,\ " Gerdts told CBC News. The 12-member team is led by Darryl Falzarano. He said the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine that provides protection against multiple coronaviruses. 
  Donald Trump declared Wednesday that the U.S. is \"very, very ready\" for whatever the coronavirus threat brings, and he put his vice-president in charge of overseeing the nation's response. The U.S. president sought to minimize fears of the virus spreading widely across the country, saying, \"I don't think it's inevitable.\" But standing next to him at a White House news conference were health authorities who reiterated that Americans need to get ready for what could become a wider outbreak requiring such steps as school closures. \"Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases we have so far. However, we do expect more cases,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than 81,000 cases of COVID-19, an illness characterized by fever and coughing and sometimes shortness of breath or pneumonia, have occurred since the new virus emerged in China. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) top infectious disease chief cautioned a vaccine won't be ready for widespread use for a year or more — but said the virus might return, so researchers have to push ahead. Dr. Anthony Fauci called it \"quite conceivable\" that the virus will \"come back and recycle next year. In that case, we hope to have a vaccine.\" National Institutes of Health's top infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci speaks as Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, right, looks on. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Trump said Vice-President Mike Pence will be working with CDC, NIH and other government agencies to co-ordinate the response. In previous outbreaks, the White House has appointed a \"czar\" to pull together the different departments' work. \"We're very, very ready for this, for anything,\" even if it's \"a breakout of larger proportions,\ " Trump told a news conference. The U.S. announced a 15th case of coronavirus Wednesday, bringing the total number of infected people in the country to 60. The CDC said the latest person is in California and was not known to have travelled to a country where a virus outbreak has been taking place, or had a connection to a known patient. On Capitol Hill, senior lawmakers called for a bipartisan spending package that would give federal, state and local officials more resources. Trump had requested $2.5 billion US to fight the virus; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York countered with an $8.5 billion US proposal. Trump told reporters he was open to spending \"whatever's appropriate.\" Trump lashes at critics Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike have questioned whether Trump's original request is sufficient. House appropriations chair Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said it's premature to put a price tag on the package. \"We're working on it and we'll have a number but I'm not sure it's going to be the number that Schumer's proposing,\" said Lowey, adding that she's working with lawmakers of both parties. Aides said the House measure is likely to be unveiled next week. Bipartisan \"four corner\" meetings — Democrats and Republicans in both the House and Senate — began Wednesday, a House Democratic aide said, with a bipartisan bill the goal. Canada preparing a Plan B pandemic response in case coronavirus containment fails Schumer has been harshly critical of Trump's response to the outbreak, and his request — announced before the Democratic-controlled House Appropriations Committee has weighed in — rankled some Democrats hoping for quick, bipartisan action to address the crisis. Arriving back in the U.S. early Wednesday, Trump immediately began to counter critics who say he should have acted sooner to bolster the federal response to the coronavirus. Trump has wondered aloud if Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is the right person to lead the administration's response. The White House had considered naming a virus czar, but was not sure that was the right route, said a person familiar with the discussions. Azar himself was said to be supportive of naming a czar.

A group of infectious disease specialists unpack why the coronavirus is causing renewed alarm around the world and what travellers should know. 11:37 Among those under consideration for such a post: former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham was also pushing back. Grisham retweeted a CDC post that said \"there is currently no reported community spread\" of coronavirus in the U.S. This week, the NIH received a shipment of test doses of a vaccine candidate from Moderna Inc., in preparation for first-step safety testing in a few dozen people aimed to begin by April. But Fauci cautioned reporters that in a best-case scenario, \"you're talking about a year to a year and a half\" before any vaccine would be ready for widespread use. WHO reluctant to declare COVID-19 pandemic as coronavirus spreads to more countries Fauci said that while only a few cases have turned up in the U.S. from travelers outside the country, \"we need to be able to think about how we will respond to a pandemic outbreak.\" \"It's very clear. If we have a global pandemic, no country is going to be without impact,\ " Fauci said. A pandemic involves the continual spread of sustained transmission from person to person in multiple regions and hemispheres throughout the world simultaneously, Fauci noted. 
  The message from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week was clear: \"Go home and stay home.\ " But public health officials have also been advising Canadians trying to follow that advice, that they can — and even should — get outside daily for some exercise.   The government of Canada website about coronavirus says, as long as you stay two metres from others, you can \"go outside for some fresh air, a run, a bike ride, or to walk the dog.\ " But then came the images of the crowded seawall in Vancouver last Friday. The Vancouver Park Board closed all public outdoor recreation facilities within its parks and beaches because of a lack of compliance with social distancing rules.   People walk and cycle on the seawall between English Bay and Sunset Beach, in Vancouver March 22. The City of Vancouver asked those using parks and beaches to maintain a distance of 2 metres between one another due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19.   (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press) Ontario closed its provincial parks over the weekend because they were too crowded.   And on Tuesday, Parks Canada closed vehicle access to its parks, saying in a statement, \"High visitation levels have occurred in a number of parks leading to public safety and health concerns, as well as increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus.\ " So in this time of social distancing, what is permitted in terms of going outside and getting some exercise. How much? How often? With whom?   We'll try to clear up some confusion. First, just an important note: this story applies to people who are symptom-free, have not recently travelled internationally, and have not been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.   This article is for people practising social distancing (or what some are now calling physical distancing). Basic recommendations Under social distancing guidelines, you can go out for groceries and other necessities. You may also go out for some exercise.   But there are no clear guidelines across every province around where you can go, what you can do, or for how long.   \"We know what we're not supposed to do,\" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toronto.   How to talk to family and friends who ignore physical distancing appeals \"We wouldn't get into a group of people to go for a jog together.\ " But he says with one other person, be it the person you live with or even a friend, as long as you keep that two-metre distance from each other, you're OK.   \"As long as there is no contact, as long as you maintain a two metre distance... I don't see why that would be an issue.\ " But that distance is crucial, says Dr. Zain Chagla, another infectious diseases specialist, from St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. \"Even friends who live in different houses are exposed to different people,\" he said. \"And so their risk of having the infection is going to be very different than someone who's living at home with you.\ " So, it's safer to exercise with someone you live with.   How far can you go? In the past week, France tightened its rules around going out for exercise, ordering people to go out alone, within one kilometre of home, for a maximum of one hour, once a day.   Chagla doesn't believe such a strict order is necessary in Canada, but he understands the thinking behind it. Walking has become a welcome relief for people feeling cooped up in these days of social distancing, but even walking the dog can present challenges in maintaining an appropriate distance from others.   (Graeme Roy/The Canadian Press) \"I don't think there should be a limit on physically how many times you need to be outdoors,\ " he said, \"But I think, you know, being close to home or at least knowing the routes you're going [to take] is probably reasonable.\ " He says if you are going for a run, for example, map out the route in your head. Make sure you will be able to keep that distance between yourself and others — maybe be able to cross over to the other side of the street, or run on someone's lawn to avoid being too close with a stranger.   It's the same with other activities like cycling.   Can you play soccer or basketball with friends? Toronto's medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, has been clear: \"Playing soccer, basketball or other team sports with friends is not social distancing,\" she said during a briefing Tuesday. No disagreement from the infectious disease specialists.   \"It's really, really hard to maintain that distancing, playing soccer, basketball, hockey, baseball, that type of thing,\" said Chagla.

The kids can go burn off some energy, right?   Wrong.   \"Not acceptable. Not acceptable. Not acceptable,\ " said Bogoch. It's all about those high-contact, high-touch surfaces. \"A playground has surfaces and you've got different kids who could be climbing over all those different surfaces,\" he said. And even if it's empty now, that's irrelevant.   \"When you look at the number of kids over the course of the last few days, there might be, you know, 20, 50 or 100, who knows?\" WATCH | Ontario Premier Doug Ford tells parents not to take kids to the park: Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he couldn't believe it when he saw parks full of kids on the weekend. 0:49 Condo challenges There have been questions raised about the safety of going outside for exercise if it involves constantly taking an elevator down to a common area like a lobby and opening a door shared by other residents.   Chagla says it can be done safely, by being extremely careful about washing your hands after you touch the elevator button or the doorknob. And he has another suggestion to limit exposure. \"Maybe you go out for one or two walks and you try to get everything done that you need to get done outside for those one or two walks, rather than going up and down, up and down.\ " Is it best just to forego exercise?   There is a great deal of mental health research that shows that even a small amount of daily exercise can do wonders for a person's mental health.   \"I think we're all feeling a little bit stressed in these stressful times,\" said Dr. David Gratzer, a psychiatrist affiliated with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. \"Something that appears over and over when one talks about mental health and exercise is that some level of exercise is better than none.\ " But he stresses that exercise doesn't have to mean going outside, if that has you worried.   \"There's a [Toronto] Raptor who's been talking about his exercise regimen during social isolation indoors.\"  De Villa agrees. \"Staying home can still mean staying active. You can try free live streamed online fitness classes, or apps to guide your in-home workout,\ " she said during the same briefing.   Grinding teeth and muscle tension: As COVID-19 stress mounts, watch for physical signsOPINION | Be sad, be mad, be bored, but stay HOME Gratzer agrees it's important to make sure you get some kind of daily activity, especially right now while people are staying home more, staying indoors, not seeing friends or extended family.    \"Particularly cardiovascular exercise, that seems to be helpful for us both in terms of reducing stress, Also in terms of treating and preventing major mental illness like major depressive disorder.\ " And Gratzer says people should also be mindful that in times of stress, people can also develop major mental illness, though it is rare.   \"And so when your child feels really overwhelmed and suicidal or your adult cousin feels the same way, that's a medical emergency, whether or not there's a pandemic. And you should seek out medical care, such as through an emergency department.\"   (CBC News) Why Canada's COVID-19 'war-time' response could be derailed by a swab on a stickOpinionCOVID-19 anxiety shows why Canada needs a 9-8-8 number for mental health emergenciesOpinionAs civil liberties erode, Canada must not allow COVID-19 outbreak to infect the rule of law
  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated.

What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  Researchers are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, but new data suggests that some people wouldn't get vaccinated even if that option became available.   Gordon Asmundson, a psychology professor at the University of Regina, is studying how psychological factors affect COVID-19's spread. The study involves three waves of surveying and is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) as part of their COVID-19 Rapid Response Initiative. Asmundson received $400,000 in funding for his research project COVID-19: The Role of Psychological Factors in the Spreading of Disease, Discrimination, and Distress, undertaken in collaboration with Steven Taylor from the University of British Columbia. \"About 20 per cent of individuals indicated [in the first wave of surveying] that should a vaccine become available, they won't be likely to take it,\ " Asmundson said. \"That's concerning given all of the push and efforts to find that vaccine.\"  The sample size for the first wave was just shy of 7,000 people in Canada and the United States. The data was collected through an internet self-report survey done by data-gathering company Qualtrics between March 21 and April 1. \"If one in five people are not going to take it, that's going to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of [stopping] the virus, of mitigating spread.\" Dr. Gordon Asmundson is a professor at the University of Regina, a mental health scientist and a registered clinical psychologist. He studies the psychological factors of epidemics and pandemics. (University of Regina Photography) Last year, WHO named \"vaccine hesitancy\ " — people unsure about the safety or efficacy of vaccines — a Top 10 threat to global health.   Asmundson said data on vaccine hesitancy will be published within the next month, following the second wave of collection.   Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab was not available for an interview, according to the Ministry of Health. He has previously said restrictions like physical distancing will be in place until a vaccine, a treatment or significant immunity is in place.   Nearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why. How a lab in Sask. that focuses on animals became Canada's $23M hope for a COVID-19 vaccine   Other factors assessed  Asmundson said they are conducting two more waves of surveying so they can measure potential changes in attitude. This will offer insight into how people are emotionally responding to COVID-19, which is \"not a one-size fits all stressor.\ "  For example, some questions look at dreaming and sleep patterns.   \"Those who are most anxious are coping by sleeping more but they're also reporting more trouble sleeping,\ " Asmundson said based on the first survey results. People reported more intrusive thoughts while awake and more bad dreams featuring bad outcomes while asleep.    Maintaining mental health and mindfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic   Asmundson said it's no surprise the virus is lurking in people's dreams because of the \"constant barrage of media attention,\" changes to daily life and a rising global death toll. Intense emotions like fear often fuel dream content, he added, as the brain uses dreams to process information.   \"This is having a huge toll on people,\ " he said. \"It's really important for people to stop and check how they're doing in terms of their mental health.\"   He said the data collection has also shown that there is a group of people who appear extraordinarily overwhelmed by the virus. In contrast, there is another group of people who aren't particularly concerned by it and might not adhere to public health advice, which could affect how the virus spreads. The end goal of the research is to develop a \"rapid assessment system that can be used to assess, for any pandemic or major epidemic, infection-related excessive anxiety and xenophobia, and risk factors for these problems.\"

(Maggie MacPherson/CBC) A look inside the COVID-19 unit at B.C.'s biggest hospital Vancouver General Hospital, the biggest hospital in B.C., is one of 17 around the province that has morphed into a primary site specializing in treating coronavirus patients. CBC News got an exclusive look inside the hospital's specialized COVID-19 unit. VGH's COVID-19 critical care unit is divided in two: the warm zone and the hot zone. The hot zone is where the infected patients are examined and treated. The warm zone is a buffer area that acts as a staging zone for health-care workers. Each team spends up to three hours making the rounds inside the hot zone before peeling off their personal protective equipment, washing their hands like lives depend on it and then rotating and swapping out. \"When the nurses come out of the hot zone, they're usually drenched in sweat, and you can see their mask that's outlined on their face,\" Dr. Donald Griesdale said. \"Then in the warm zone, if issues come up … we have a really good two-way system so we're easily able to communicate with the staff inside the hot zone.\ " The warm zone is also where all of the experts involved — from physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists to dietitians and pharmacists — convene and communicate. As a team, they discuss all the issues for each patient and come up with individual care plans for the day. Nurses are the main point of human contact for patients. And there's an underlying uncertainty on both sides that's hard to describe. Mostly, it's fear of the unknown. \"[Patients are] scared when they come in, they're scared of getting a breathing tube put in, they're scared of what's going to happen. And we're scared for them, to be honest,\" said Jess Donald, a registered nurse who's worked in the emergency room at VGH since 2007. The biggest challenge, she said, is finding ways to have personal interaction. Despite technology's best attempts, the feeling of isolation never really goes away. But if you ask the doctors and nurses about the pressure of serving on the front lines against this virus, they say it's not about them, writes CBC's Tanya Fletcher. It's about everyone: a caring community that's become an unexpected inspiration, and the support of a province is the most pleasant surprise of all. Click below to watch more from The National Part 1 of 3 of Rosemary Barton’s exclusive interview with Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam about Canada’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 9:44 IN BRIEF PM says COVID-19 measures are working, but Canada is 'not out of the woods yet' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today that new modelling shows public health measures are working to slow the spread of COVID-19 — but cautioned that easing restrictions too fast could wipe out the progress made to date. \"We are in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen, and if we lift measures too quickly, we could lose the progress we've made,\ " Trudeau said. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, cited some positive pandemic news in the new modelling data. Caseload growth is slowing across the country and Canada has experienced slower growth than many other countries, she said. New modelling shows that while the number of new cases was doubling every three days previously, it is now doubling every 16 days. Tam said the revised projections reflect the \"heavy toll\" the virus is taking on vulnerable populations. For the virus to die out, the average number of people to whom an infected individual passes the virus has to drop below one. Tam said that right now, strong controls such as physical distancing and self-isolation have limited the average number of people each case infects to slightly more than one. Tam warned that public health measures will need to remain in place until there is a high level of immunity or a vaccine to avoid \"future epidemic waves.\" Read more about the latest federal modelling   Doctors want Ottawa to keep them in the loop on PPE shortages, CMA survey says Canada's medical doctors are calling on the federal government to be more open and transparent about the supply of personal protective equipment, saying pervasive anxiety on the front lines of the pandemic fight could be eased by more information. The Canadian Medical Association recently conducted a survey of its physician members and found the overwhelming majority of the nearly 2,500 doctors who responded are feeling stressed about the pandemic and its impact on their families and patients. CMA president Dr. Sandy Buchman said more than a quarter of the doctors who participated in the survey said the problem of shortages of PPE has improved in the last three weeks — while another 25 per cent-plus said the situation has become worse. Roughly four in 10 of those surveyed saw little change either way. Acknowledging the government is going \"full out\" to procure protective gear, Buchman said little information about the status of supplies is trickling down to the front lines. \"We're not hearing what's coming down the pipeline in a clear and co-ordinated way,\ " Buchman told CBC. \"Where is it? When do you anticipate it is coming to us, to our region, to our hospital?\ " Read more about the survey  When will elective surgeries resume? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one from an audience member whose surgery in Toronto was cancelled in mid-March. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that the province is planning to bring back surgeries, prioritizing cancer operations, as part of its roadmap to reopen, but she would not specify when. Officials acknowledge they need to see a consistent reduction in new COVID-19 cases before easing restrictions. In the dramatically scaled-back operating room activity amid the pandemic, hospitals across Canada are continuing to perform surgeries on patients who are at high risk of death or disability if they aren't treated within days or weeks — a category that includes the most urgent cancer and cardiovascular cases. You can read more about the backlog of surgeries created by the cancellations during the pandemic here. Read more answers to COVID-19 questions   THE SCIENCE How COVID-19 symptoms develop, and how long they last   Here's a closer look at what has been learned about how COVID-19 symptoms develop from international studies and interviews with front-line doctors. An important note: the averages represent typical cases, and there tends to be a wide range at all stages of the disease. The period in which a person is infected but shows no symptoms appears to average around five to six days, although it can vary from one to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization and Chinese data. Because people without symptoms aren't usually tested, positive tests typically represent infections that happened on average five days and up to two weeks earlier. Studies also suggest people with no symptoms or mild symptoms are responsible for most of the spread. Even those who go on to experience more severe symptoms typically begin with mild symptoms, most often fever and a dry cough, although they can also include more unusual symptoms such as loss of taste and smell. Symptoms will remain mild in about 80 per cent of cases, the WHO says, until recovery in about 14 days. Typically, the cough lasts a week longer than the fever, a Chinese study found. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are told to recover at home. A key, more severe symptom that sometimes leads to hospitalization is shortness of breath or dyspnea, which shows up on average five to six days after symptoms began, Chinese researchers reported in medical journals JAMA and The Lancet. Studies in China and the U.S suggest that most patients who are hospitalized are admitted, on average, about a week after symptoms begin. In Canada, patients appear to be sickest at about that time, said Dr. Bram Rochwerg, site lead at the Juravinski Hospital intensive care unit in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University. AND FINALLY... How a puzzle library in Sackville, N.B., became an appreciated distraction amid the pandemic Angela Swanson opened a puzzle library out of her carport to share her love of puzzles and to give people in Sackville, N.B., something to do during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tori Weldon/CBC) Angela Swanson had planned to start a puzzle library out of her Sackville, N.B., home in the fall — but when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, she decided now was the time. She canvassed friends and cleaned out her own collection to stock the shelves in her carport with jigsaw puzzles in a variety of colours and sizes. Swanson spread the word through social media, and before long neighbours and strangers were dropping by to pick out their next pandemic puzzle. \"Puzzles are fun and they take time to make and you feel like you've accomplished something at the end,\ " Swanson said. Anyone can simply come and take a puzzle, with no obligation to return it, though so far many people do. When a donation comes in, Swanson wipes the box and puts it in quarantine for a few days until it's deemed safe. So far, about 100 puzzles have been donated. Counting the ones that have been returned and loaned out again, she said there have been 180 puzzle transactions in five weeks.

  This column is an opinion by Michael Morden, research director of the Samara Centre for Democracy, a non-partisan charity dedicated to strengthening Canada's democracy.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. COVID-19 has marooned politicians and shuttered legislatures all over the world. For the foreseeable future, elected representatives are going to have dramatically less contact with the people they represent. That probably isn't the first thing on your mind in this pandemic crisis — nor should it be. But the effects of COVID-19 are going to put real strains on representative democracy, which is already under pressure. Most elected representatives are still most comfortable engaging constituents the old-fashioned way: face-to-face on doorsteps, at events, and in constituency offices. The Samara Centre for Democracy has conducted exit interviews with Members of Parliament for the past 10 years, and they frankly admit that while they would like to do more sophisticated forms of public engagement and make better use of (no-longer very new) digital avenues, they simply don't know where to start. The Centre's ongoing monitoring of Canadian democratic participation shows just how limited the uptake of digital engagement has been. There has actually been a decline in contact from political leaders in recent years, despite new tools and opportunities. In 2019, for example, 54 per cent of Canadians reported having been contacted by a party, candidate, or MP, down from 63 per cent in 2014. And while nearly all elected representatives are present on social media, most are using those platforms to broadcast, rather than to generate or sustain two-way conversations. On average, just 13 per cent of Canadian MPs' tweets are replies or quoted tweets, for example. Members of Parliament, attending in limited numbers and seated apart to practice physical distancing, wait for proceedings to begin in the House of Commons on April 11 as Parliament was recalled for the consideration of measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Considering the technological strides made in the past 25 years, it's amazing how little progress society has made toward realizing the potential of digital connectivity to enrich democracy. MPs pass motion to hold in-person, virtual sittings in House on COVID-19 crisisAnalysisYes, we can have a 'virtual' Parliament — but we shouldn't get used to the idea Part of this may be attributed to a dramatic shift in how we look at digital technologies. A decade ago, we were enthralled by the emancipatory potential of social media. Embarrassingly so, given how social media has actually enabled surveillance, empowered authoritarians, and provided a platform for populist political performances that erode the trust foundations on which democracy is built. But the pendulum swung hard in the opposite direction, and it's now an article of faith that the internet is a problem for democracy to overcome. Research and action on digital democracy generally means reacting against online harms — data theft, privacy violations, misinformation, harassment, and threats to electoral integrity. This work represents a badly needed response to real problems, and there's so much more to do. But as COVID-19 forces more of our day-to-day lives online, can't we also recover some of our original aspirations for the digital public sphere, even if we're somewhat sadder but wiser? Well after the initial outbreak crisis begins to subside, the long tail of the pandemic will radically reshape how elected leaders are able to connect with their constituents. Our first ministers across the country have commanded the airwaves, and communicated about the crisis in ways that are clear, calm, and frank. But our political class is much broader than that, and founded on a strong culture of responsibility and good governance. Canadian elected representatives at all levels and in all localities can play a useful role:   First, in communicating high-quality information. Second, in collecting real-time feedback on how the pandemic response and economic relief measures are functioning in Canada's diverse local communities. Third, in helping sustain their communities and our democracy during this isolating moment.   They're the ones who must make energetic and creative use of digital platforms. But is constructive, pro-democratic digital communication even possible? The government and the opposition parties have yet to reach an agreement about how to restart Parliament in an effective way that respects physical distancing restrictions as well. 1:43 There are some promising leads to follow. For example, in recent years several American political scientists have experimented with online deliberative townhall meetings between citizens and members of Congress. Constituents are randomly selected to ensure a broad and representative sample of the community. Different formats have been explored, and a focused discussion on a  single issue seems to yield the best exchanges. The outcomes are encouraging. The research is still in its early stages, but there are indications that these exercises can help rebuild the relationship between representatives and citizens, reduce polarization, increase civic knowledge, and build trust. There are endless models and approaches to experiment with. Representatives can take it upon themselves to experiment with the tools available to them, staying mindful of inequities in digital access. Since the lockdown descended, there's already been an encouraging flurry of simple first steps among entrepreneurial representatives who are launching newsletters and podcasts, or hosting live video chats and telephone town halls. Municipal councils grapple with ways to be transparent during COVID-19OPINION | It's time to act on rural internet access Ultimately, given the importance of design, the legislatures and the public sector should also help equip them with expertise and resources. The point is that constructive, substantive, two-way digital conversations between elected representatives and their constituents are possible. The online politician doesn't have to sound like Donald Trump. The online citizen can meaningfully learn about and shape public decision-making. In-person contact can't be replaced, but in the maelstrom and aftermath of COVID-19, we need to start finally unearthing the democratic potential of the digital public sphere. Leaders and citizens have been drifting apart for some time. Let's stay home and get to know each other.    This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"
  Alberta researchers are hopeful that an antiviral drug engineered to treat the deadly Ebola virus will prove a viable treatment in the ongoing fight against the coronavirus. The drug remdesivir has already been used intravenously to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis during the escalating pandemic. Clinical trial studies began enrolling patients in early March. Gilead Sciences — an American biotechnology company with a production facility in Edmonton — developed the drug in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, where it was tested in a clinical trial. Results showed that several other treatments were more effective against Ebola and remdesivir was discontinued as a treatment. However, testing on monkeys infected with MERS — the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus — suggested the drug could be effective against coronaviruses. ' A very potent compound' The first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States received remdesivir for compassionate use, which allows the use of an unapproved drug to treat a seriously-ill patient when no other treatments are available. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit and received the drug on the seventh day of illness. The next day the patient showed a marked improvement and his symptoms eventually disappeared altogether. If proven effective, remdesivir would be one of the few available remedies for a respiratory illness which has killed thousands of people around the world.   Anecdotal evidence and promising results in animals trials make the drug a strong candidate for clinical trials, said Matthias Götte, chair of the medical microbiology and immunology department at the University of Alberta. Götte has been working with his team to find out how the drug may be used to treat coronaviruses. An attack from the inside His study, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in late February, was among the first in Canada to examine the COVID-19 strain, and explore why remdesivir might be an effective treatment. \"We know the drug works against different coronaviruses, like MERS and SARS, and we know the novel coronavirus is very similar to SARS,\" Götte said. \"The pre-clinical data looked very good. It was a very potent compound so we were interested in the actual mechanism, how that drug actually works against Ebola. \"We created a synthetic version of this enzyme and, in a test tube, we were able to study the mechanism of remdesivir against this Ebola target.\ "   Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world Wednesday   Götte's research shows that the drug stops the virus from replicating. It disrupts the viruses biochemistry by masquerading as a part of the virus itself.    \"Remdesivir essentially mimics one of the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis necessary for genome replication of the virus,\ " Götte said. \"Enzymes within the virus are synthesizing the viral RNA genome with these building blocks, but they mix up the bits they need with the drug. Once the drug is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the virus can no longer replicate.\"   Last week, Gilead Sciences announced two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in about 1,000 adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The company said the randomized studies will begin this month in countries across Asia and in other countries where COVID-19 has been diagnosed in higher numbers.   This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.- Matthias Gotte. Götte said no matter the results of the studies, his team will continue to examine how the drug interacts with the new virus. The results of the clinical trial will be only the first step in finding an effective treatment, and one drug will likely not be enough.    \"Ideally, we will have a couple of drugs because certain strains could be resistant to certain treatments,\ " Götte said. He will be anxiously awaiting the results of the ongoing clinical trials which could be available as early as May. \"One thing is clear. This is not a cure,\ " Götte said. \"We have to wait for the clinical trial results. That's the gold standard and we have to be patient.\ "     \"This drug is quite potent against it's target but that does not necessarily translate into success in clinical trials.\"  Overwhelming demand     Meanwhile, Gilead, overwhelmed by demand for the experimental treatment, abruptly shut down its emergency access program this week.   The company said it was setting up a broader access program that could try to help more sick people but its current program is unprepared to handle the current health crisis.    \"We recognize that there are severely ill patients who are unable to enrol in clinical trials and for whom no approved treatment options are effective,\ " reads a statement from the company. \"Gilead has been working with regulatory agencies to provide remdesivir to these patients where feasible.\"  Treating the coronavirus: improvising now, but with real hope on the horizon   To date, the company said it has provided emergency access to remdesivir for several hundred patients in the United States, Europe and Japan. Health Canada had also been considering special access requests for the drug on a patient-by-patient basis. \"In recent weeks, there has been an exponential increase in compassionate-use requests for emergency access to remdesivir, related to the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States,\" reads the statement from Gilead. \"This has flooded an emergency-treatment-access system that was set up for very limited access to investigational medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic.\"  'A fundamental shift': Nearly half of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada now from community spread
 \"Test, test, test.\ " That's the first rule in the war against COVID-19, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). \"You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,\ " Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, said in a briefing on Monday. But right now, Canada does not know who is infected. Or how many people are infected. And some Canadians might never know if they had COVID-19. That's because not everyone can get a test, even if they have symptoms and think they might have the illness. Access to testing varies across the country. In Ontario, tests are being rationed so that there will be enough for the highest priority patients, including health-care workers. \"The extremely high volume of COVID-19 tests being conducted at the Public Health Ontario Laboratory requires us to start prioritizing testing for the most vulnerable people in our health system and those who treat patients,\" a Public Health Ontario spokesperson told CBC News via email. \"In terms of who should not be tested, people who do not have symptoms do not require testing.\" So far, nearly 66,000 Canadians have been tested, including about 17,000 in B.C., 16,650 in Ontario and 14,500 in Alberta. About 873 Canadians have tested positive, and 12 deaths have been reported. At Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital, a new guidance document describes the latest testing protocol. Anyone who is asymptomatic will be sent home without a test and be instructed to self-isolate and monitor themselves for common cold symptoms. Even people who have mild symptoms will not be tested unless they work in a high-risk setting such as a hospital or a long-term care facility. A health-care worker speaks to another staff member portraying the role of a patient during preparations for the opening of the COVID-19 assessment centre at Brewer Park Arena in Ottawa last Friday. Doctors don't necessarily need to know whether a person is infected with the virus to begin treatment for COVID-19. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) At Toronto's Humber River Hospital, emergency physician Dr. Tasleem Nimjee said the \"at risk\" list includes paramedics, hospital staff, and people working in prisons. \"These are groups that we would certainly want to test because we worry about the risk, if they do have the infection, of infecting large numbers of people.\" Supply shortages So, why are tests being rationed? One major problem is a shortage of laboratory supplies. For days, doctors in hospitals across Canada have watched anxiously as they run low on supplies of nasal swabs needed to test patients. The Public Health Agency of Canada put out an urgent call to university research groups asking them to donate testing chemicals, called reagents, along with other products needed to do virus testing. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territoryWho gets called back? Montrealer's experience highlights confusion over COVID-19 test results At the same time, Health Canada issued an interim order  to speed up the importation of COVID-19 viral detection kits.   Dr. Allison McGeer at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital said the lack of trained staff could become another strain on the system. \"The entire supply chain is fragile in this situation, and both enough [testing] machines and enough staff are problems,\ " she told CBC News in an email. In Ontario, people are waiting up to five days to learn whether they tested positive for COVID-19. It's a situation Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott called \"unacceptable\" at a briefing yesterday. A nurse wearing protective gear takes a swab from a passenger who arrived from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh during a COVID-19 test at the Minsk National Airport in Belarus. (Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters) Alberta increased its capacity to more than 2,000 tests per day, but the province's chief medical officer said they can't keep going at that level. \"These are not numbers that the labs can necessarily sustain in the long term,\ " Dr. Deena Hinshaw said during a briefing on Thursday. \"We do not have a capacity, and we will not have the capacity in the short or medium term to test every Albertan who has a cough or a runny nose.\" Testing key to containment Politicians, public health officials and researchers agree that testing rates must increase, because there are fears Canada might be missing hundreds of cases. \"I think it's pretty clear from what we've seen in Europe that we need to ramp up and we need to be thinking outside of the normal box and doing whatever we can to increase capacity,\" said Jim Woodgett, director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. Testing is not a luxury, WHO officials stress. Rather, it is the key to containing the spread of the virus. Only by knowing who is infected can public health officials stop the chain of infection. What to do if you're home sick with COVID-19 It's believed that many people who are infected experience almost no symptoms. Those people need to know that they are contagious and take action to self-isolate. Widespread population testing in South Korea is credited for containing that country's outbreak. Testing is also the only way to get an accurate picture of the pandemic and determine the true fatality rate. Right now, the death rate is a percentage of all of the known cases and ranges from about 0.28 to 10 per cent depending on the country. But that number would drop dramatically if it could be proven that there are many more infections that are not being counted right now because people have not become sick enough to go to a doctor. University research labs are ready to help Woodgett said university and hospital research laboratories in Canada are standing by ready to help with testing. \"We're in unusual and critical times where we should be looking at how best to safely expand testing using the expertise which is in the research laboratories,\" he said. \"The research hospitals in most of our major cities have this tremendous capability. The universities also.\" A nurse holds a nose swab after administering it on a patient at a drive-in testing site at the Regional Hospital Centre in Liege, Belgium. Testing for the virus isn't hard, but 'you have to have tremendous quality control,' says Jim Woodgett, director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. (Francois Lenoir/Reuters) Although Canada's research labs have the necessary testing equipment, there are quality control issues that have to be worked out. \"This is not a difficult test at all,\" said Woodgett. \"However, what's key here is that you have to have tremendous quality control because you don't want to get the result wrong.\" As officials grapple with the obstacles to increased testing, social isolation remains the primary method of controlling viral spread. It's the default instruction for anyone who has returned from travel, or anyone who has symptoms. Test not needed for treatment The fact is, doctors don't need to know whether a person is infected to begin taking care of them. That's because there are no drugs or specific therapies that are available to treat the disease. Watch:  Why some sick Canadians aren't getting tested for the coronavirus   A look at why the health-care system is rationing coronavirus tests. 1:56 \"At this point, testing isn't particularly clinically informative because what physicians are doing mostly is just trying to stabilize those patients by treating their symptoms, not by treating the virus directly,\" said Matthew Miller, an infectious disease researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton. Got questions about physical distancing? Here's what you need to know That means doctors are only able to offer supportive care for patients who are seriously ill, including providing ventilator breathing assistance if they become critically ill. People with mild illness will be sent home to recover, Miller said. \"The majority of people who experience mild symptoms, they need to stay at home whether they have coronavirus or whether there's a possibility they have something else.\ "
  In the quiet of the University of Saskatchewan's shuttered campus, there is one constant beacon of light and hope. Dr. Volker Gerdts and his team of researchers are working in shifts around the clock to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — and feeling the pressure to move even faster. \"There is a real sense of urgency,\" Dr. Gerdts says. \"We have a highly motivated team, and everybody is willing to step up and do as much as they can. And so this is really, you know, a race against the disease.\" Gerdts is the director and chief executive officer of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac). The lab in Saskatoon is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks. A recent $28-million funding boost from the federal and provincial government to enhance its COVID-19 research capacity to test antivirals, drugs, and therapeutics has been helping fast-track that research even more. And on April 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion national strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19, including:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19. An immunity task force focused on blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 VIDO-InterVac is already at the forefront of an extraordinary global effort to halt the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. It's one of a handful of labs in the world with a potential vaccine at the animal testing phase. The new federal funding includes $23 million to support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. \"What was my reaction? Ecstatic,\ " Gerdts says. \"Good to see the commitment from the Government to fund a Canadian vaccine for Canadians.\ " Dr. Volker Gerdts is director and CEO of the lab at the University of Saskatchewan, one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world, which is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. (VIDO-InterVac/University of Saskatchewan) Next month could be a turning point for VIDO-InterVac, when ferrets — chosen because their respiratory system is similar to that of humans — are exposed to the novel coronavirus to see if the lab's vaccine candidate works. VIDO-InterVac is also testing other researchers' vaccines on hamsters. Gerdts says the research is moving at an accelerated rate, and everyone is looking for a breakthrough before the pandemic's next potential wave of infections. \"The concern that we all have at the moment is whether there is another phase to this or not. And so having a vaccine for the next phase is absolutely critical. It will allow us to improve what we call herd immunity, to get more people vaccinated — more people with an immune response in the population, and the better we all are protected in the future.\" There are at least 70 research teams around the world, including in Canada, racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in a year, something that has never been done before. 1:58 International network Gerdts' team is part of the World Health Organization's pandemic vaccine network, made up of expert groups of nearly 200 scientists and researchers from around the world. They're working in tandem and exchanging notes in real time on medical servers and through weekly phone calls. There's even a vaccine tracker built by the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that monitors the 60-plus COVID vaccines in development and their progress. It's a remarkable coordinated effort that is breaking down scientific borders and academic bragging rights. \"The most important thing in all of this is not to be first,\" says virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh, who is part of the WHO vaccine braintrust. Duprex says scientists usually compete to publish their findings first, for the credit that comes with it. The new virus has changed that, and there will be plenty of time to publish later. \"Let's just cut the crap and move forward and work together and be collegial. This is a worldwide problem, and this is a worldwide issue that we should solve together,\ " he says. Virologist Paul Duprex from the University of Pittsburgh is part of the WHO team working on a COVID-19 vaccine. He says the collaborative approach to this project is allowing research to move forward much faster than usual. (Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh) Duprex adds that the WHO collaboration is speeding up the process to find a successful vaccine among the dozens in development. \"I'm really glad that we've got lots and lots of different options, because you know what's going to happen. Those vaccines are going to faIl at different stages in the testing process,\" says Duprex. \"So therefore, if we have backups upon backups and backups, that allows us to get something across the finish line.\ " 'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Infectious disease researcher Allison McGeer says this new, faster pace of global research means a vaccine could be developed more quickly and that could save lives. \"It's critically important to do it faster,\ " says McGeer, who is with the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, part of Sinai Health in Toronto. McGeer says that doesn't mean shortcutting safety trials, but rather streamlining research processes to get a safe and effective vaccine into people's arms faster. \"That allows a certain amount of creativity about how to do that. Whereas normally people would say, 'well, you know, I'm just not sure about that and I want to be absolutely sure about it.' Now there's a good reason for doing it differently and you can make processes for developing vaccines faster in general, which we all agree would be a good thing.\" The search for a COVID 19 vaccine is already well underway and the University of Toronto joined the race thanks to a $10 million donation.   Ali Chiasson spoke to the research lead for this new lab that will be running 24/7. 2:43 A Canadian team At VIDO-InterVac, Gerdts says if his team's potential vaccine passes the animal test next month, human trials will follow in the fall and pave the way for a possible vaccine in a year. The new government funding is also building manufacturing capacity in Canada, including at VIDO-Intervac, which hopes to be in a position to produce up to 20 million doses of new vaccine during a pandemic. Science summary: A look at novel coronavirus research around the globe And while all the work behind finding a vaccine is part of a global effort, Gerdts says it's a uniquely Canadian one, too. \"We're a Canadian team making a vaccine for Canadians, and so it's our highest priority to make sure that this vaccine will be available for Canadians. And we have received funding from the federal government and the provincial government to do this kind of research, so it's important that we make sure that Canadians will have access to our vaccine.\" The team from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre ( VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan that is working on a COVID-19 vaccine. (Debra Marshall Photography) And while this pandemic is still in its early stages, Gerdts is already looking ahead to the next one. He says good science can simulate the evolution of a pathogen in the lab, to help predict the next deadly virus and give the world time to prepare. The lessons of this pandemic, Dr. Gerdts says, are already too harsh. \"We're still talking about a year before we have a vaccine ready. People are dying right now, and the cost to the global economy is already in the trillions. We need to have vaccines ready for whatever the next pathogen might be. And this is where we have to push the envelope.\"
  Public health researchers in the U.K. say that the spread of misinformation during a disease outbreak may make the outbreak more severe, and that reducing the amount of harmful advice circulating by even a little bit could mitigate that effect.   Julii Brainard and Paul R. Hunter at the University of East Anglia reached that conclusion using a simulation to model how the spread of information might affect the spread of three different viral diseases. Their results were first presented at a U.K. public health conference in 2018 but were published again recently in the journal Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique (Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health).   The findings could be relevant in light of how far and how fast misinformation has spread around COVID-19 in recent weeks. The novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December and since then has killed more than 2,200 people and sickened tens of thousands more, according to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak has led to quarantines, travel restrictions and cancellations of events around the world — prompted in part by an abundance of caution, and in part by misinformation about the virus's spread.   VideoBusting garlic cures and other false coronavirus claimsDubious screenshot claims Chinese website published 'real' coronavirus death toll The WHO was so concerned, it set up a \"myth busters\" page to debunk claims such as eating garlic or spraying chlorine all over your body can prevent coronavirus infection (they can't). Members of the International Fact-Checking Network, a group set up by the non-profit journalism organization Poynter, have run over 430 stories debunking claims around coronavirus since Jan. 22.   How the simulation works Brainard explained that there are many existing models for how disease can spread which factor in the ways people move around and have contact with each other, and how often that can lead to illness.   \"What we did differently in this that hadn't been done before was  we had information spread, but the information could be good or bad in terms of affecting behaviour,\ " she said.   So in the simulation, \"people could take both good advice on how to avoid contracting a disease, or they might take bad advice, anything from failing to wash their hands to actively seeking out someone who is ill.\ "  An image from the World Health Organization debunking a myth that applying sesame oil on your skin can protect people from contracting COVID-19. (World Health Organization) Brainard and Hunter used real-world data for influenza, norovirus and monkeypox, which all have different incubation periods and recovery times. This was intended to show that the findings could be adapted to different diseases and different situations.   Brainard also explained that they considered the spread of bad information cumulative in their model. \"So if you have good information and bad information circulating, and if the bad information is kind of winning out, then over time you're going to drift into more and more bad habits,\ " she said. Misinformation led to more risks In the first stage of the model, Brainard said, they assumed diseases spread without people changing their behaviour in any way, and then they measured how many people got sick. In the second stage, half the people in the model were exposed to good information and half exposed to bad. The simulation was set up to replicate information-sharing patterns from a study published in the journal Science in 2018  which examined false news spread on Twitter over an 11-year period. That study found that false news reached more people than truthful information, and it reached them faster.   The result in Brainard and Hunter's model was that more people got sick because they took more risks with their health due to following bad advice: in the influenza example, 82.7 per cent of the population got sick in the second stage, versus 59.2 per cent in the first stage.   While in real life, fewer people would actually get the flu because they have prior immunity, the researchers assumed no one had prior immunity to the diseases in their model — which is more likely to be the case with a newly identified virus like COVID-19. The model also found that reducing the amount of harmful advice circulating by just 10 per cent could reduce the effect of bad information on an outbreak. How social media platforms are fighting coronavirus misinformationOnline claims that Chinese scientists stole coronavirus from Winnipeg lab have 'no factual basis' In the third stage of the model, Brainard said, they assumed that 60 per cent of people received good information and 40 per cent received bad information — and even that small change resulted in sickness numbers dropping back to levels comparable to the first stage of the model. The model also took into account that people must be in physical contact to spread the disease, but information about the disease can be passed along through social media and virtual contact. Brainard said she was surprised that a relatively small reduction of misinformation in the model could change outcomes.   \"I thought, you know, maybe we'd need a more dramatic difference,\ " she said. \"But that is basically saying just a small leverage in one direction or the other can actually have a big impact in terms of countering the effects of [misinformation].\"  Still, Brainard cautions, her work is a model under development and hasn't been tested in real-world settings, something she would like to see in the future. \"I think it's just one step toward trying to figure out how ... we can influence the narrative and influence what sources of information people are using. It's only a start,\" said Brainard. 
  Scientists around the world are racing to find novel ways to treat, mitigate or prevent infection from the novel coronavirus. The response has been especially rapid as the virus has spread unchecked across the globe. Still, any treatments are a long way from being proven both effective and safe, and most certainly won't come in time to address the current pandemic. According to some of the top infectious disease experts in the world, even on an accelerated timeline, a vaccine is still likely 12 to 18 months away — and then the challenge will be producing enough to make it readily available. There is currently no drug therapy or vaccine approved anywhere in the world for COVID-19. Here are the latest developments in the research. Old drugs, new tricks May 1: Health Canada announces it has authorized the CONCOR-1 clinical study that will involve soliciting donations of blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients across the country to see if their antibodies can help treat people who are sick. April 15: Japan's Fujifilm announces it is ramping up production of Avigan (favipiravir), a drug approved in 2014 to treat influenza that doesn't respond to other drugs. It's produced and distributed at the discretion of the Japanese government and has never been commercially available anywhere in the world. The drug is in Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan, and in other trials in the U.S., Italy and China. April 9: The University of British Columbia announces that patient enrolment is underway for the Canadian arm of the World Health Organization's global SOLIDARITY trial, called CATCO (Canadian Trials for COVID). Patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 at one of 20 participating hospitals in Canada will be eligible for the trial, which will start by evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir, a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, compared with \"optimized supportive care.\" It will later add two other medications for investigation — the antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria. Made-in-Canada quick, portable COVID-19 test kits approved for use April 3: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announces an \"expanded access\" program to facilitate wider study of convalescent plasma  —  that is, injecting the antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered into patients who are sick — as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. The Mayo Clinic is named lead site to co-ordinate the program among dozens of doctors and scientists who initially self-organized to conduct such research. April 2: Canadian Blood Services (CBS) says it is working with researchers to design a large, national clinical trial on treating the novel coronavirus with convalescent plasma.  Pending Health Canada approval, CBS and Héma-Québec will be responsible for supplying the convalescent plasma to hospitals across the country. WATCH |  Dr. Dana Devine explains how 'convalescent plasma' will be collected and used:   \"We think it's most likely to be effective is when you have a patient who is clearly sick with the virus but whose own immune system hasn't had a chance to make antibodies yet,\ " CBS chief scientist Dr. Dana Devine told CBC Radio's Quirks & Quarks.   Convalescent plasma has been used in a small number of COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began, but not in a study comparing those who receive the therapy with those who don't.   March 26: University of Manitoba researchers begin recruiting participants for a series of trials to test whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can reduce the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 and slow its spread. The trial, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta and McGill University Health Centre, will include participants who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who live with someone who has. Long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, but Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said the short, five-day trial should be \"very safe.\"   Manitoba researchers begin clinical trial with drug they hope can help in COVID-19 fight   \"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the health care system.\ " But experts, including Canada's chief public health officer, warn that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side-effects.  They also say there is a danger that hoarding the medication could hurt the many patients who take it for chronic inflammatory diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.   Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19  March 25: New York's Mount Sinai hospital begins treating critically ill COVID-19 patients via plasmapheresis, a century-old therapy that involves removing antibody-rich plasma from blood and returning it to a patient (the same or another) after either treating it or replacing it. In this case, doctors will transfer antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients into sick ones in the hopes the antibodies will neutralize the disease. .<a href=\"https://twitter.com /MountSinaiNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MountSinaiNYC</a> to begin the transfer of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> antibodies into critically ill patients: <a href=\"https://t.co /bpSB2HuSqR\">https://t.co/ bpSB2HuSqR</a > <a href=\"https://t.co /GpEHoHEEM6\">pic.twitter.com/ GpEHoHEEM6</a>&mdash;@IcahnMountSinai March 24 : The Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton announces a study beginning in April to compare therapy using a combination of the antibiotic azithromycin with malaria drug chloroquine versus the usual \"standard of care\" in COVID-19 patients. The trial will involve some 1,500 participants  —  a mix of patients who have been hospitalized for the virus and others in the community who have tested positive for it. March 23: Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute say they are recruiting up to 6,000 Quebecers over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus to study whether colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat gout, Behçet's disease and familial Mediterranean fever, is effective in treating respiratory complications of COVID-19, like lung inflammation, before patients need ventilators or die. Quebecers who meet the criteria and wish to take part in the study at the Montreal Heart Institute can find out more from their doctor or by calling 1-877-536-6837. (Montreal Heart Institute) \"It's inexpensive , it's widely available and the reason why we think it might very well work is that it's a powerful anti-inflammatory agent,\"  Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, the institute's research director, said in an interview with CBC Montreal's Daybreak.   Montreal Heart Institute launches clinical study into colchicine as potential COVID-19 treatment  March 18: The World Health Organization announces the SOLIDARITY trial, a co-ordinated international study into potential treatments for COVID-19 that will test and compare four different drugs or combinations of drugs either developed or already licensed for use to treat other illnesses: remdesivir, an antiviral; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; interferon beta-1a, used to treat multiple sclerosis, with lopinavir and ritonavir; and anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Canada is among the countries participating. March 11: The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic.   March 6: Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, begins two Phase 3 trials of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola: one in patients with \"severe disease\" and another in patients with \"moderate disease.\" The studies will be conducted in the U.S., U.K., Italy, Hong Kong, Spain and a number of other countries.   List of COVID-19 clinical trials authorized by Health Canada  Feb. 21: The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initiates a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir, which is believed to operate by stopping the virus from replicating. Remdesivir is an investigational drug, meaning it's not currently approved anywhere to treat any condition. It was developed to treat Ebola but was ultimately unsuccessful. Participants in this trial will be COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia.   Immunizing the herd April 30: There are eight vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, and 94 in preclinical evaluation. April 21: U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces that a vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University will begin human trials on April 23. He said the British government was providing £20 million to the Oxford team to help fund their clinical trials, and a further £22.5 million to researchers at Imperial College London, who are working on another potential vaccine that they have been testing in animals. The Oxford research team said one million doses of its vaccine candidate were already being manufactured, in hopes it turns out to be effective.

 Biologists and wildlife-rehabilitation volunteers are being warned not to handle bats during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the possibility of infecting millions of the flying mammals in North America. The Canadian Wildlife Health Co-Operative (CWHC) is about to recommend the suspension of fieldwork involving bats, said University of Winnipeg biologist Craig Willis, one of the wildlife disease experts developing this new advice. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has made a similar recommendation to American bat biologists. While the chance of an infected biologist passing on COVID-19 to a bat is remote, the result would be disastrous, Willis said.   The fear is millions of North American bats could become hosts for COVID-19, which is caused by a coronavirus similar to those present in Asian bats, he said. Sick vampire bats isolate from friends but continue to care for family \"Even though the risk is low, I think the consequences for public health, but also bat conservation and people's opinions of bats, would not be great. So people are just being extra, extra careful,\" Willis said in an interview. \"We know that this virus can infect a range of species, or at least it appears that way. The question of course is … if it did spill back into bats or other wildlife, we would end up with another wildlife reservoir that could in turn pass it back to people. \"That would make eradicating it from North America, or Europe for that matter, extremely difficult, if not impossible.\" A big brown bat hangs in a hibernaculum. University of Winnipeg biology professor Craig Willis, who studies and tracks bats, is calling on the public to help researchers monitor bat populations this spring and summer. (Mary-Anne Collis) SARS-CoV-2, the formal name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has genetic similarities to a coronavirus found in Asian horseshoe bats. The theory is those bats transmitted the virus to another species, where it evolved into the micro-organism that has so far killed more than 100,000 people and sickened nearly two million. \"We may never know actually … where this thing came from,\ " Willis said.    Why tracing the animal source of coronavirus matters   Nonetheless, Willis said it's very likely that North American bat species, such as the little brown bat, could carry this new coronavirus. \"We know that our bats in North America carry coronaviruses, as many other species do. But this new one that's making so many people sick and causing such problems for our public health system — that one certainly isn't in our bats,\ " he said.   \"But there are other viruses that are in all sorts of wildlife, and I think one of the things that happened over the course of my career is we've started to recognize that people studying wildlife should probably do a little bit better job of wearing personal protective equipment when we're working with our animals.\" The shortage of gloves, masks and other personal protective equipment for health-care workers means that equipment should not be used by biologists right now.   \"It's very important to keep it in reserves for our frontline public health people. So that's also one of the reasons we're recommending not handling bats at the moment,\" Willis said. A bat with white-nose syndrome, a fungal infection that has killed millions of bats across North America. Researchers have found the fungus can weaken bats' robust immune systems and allow them to shed more viruses. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) The novel coronavirus may not hurt a healthy North American bat, Willis said. As highly social creatures that congregate in huge numbers, bats have evolved very strong immune systems that can tolerate the presence of many pathogens, including a number of coronaviruses, he said. Nonetheless, Willis and colleagues at the University of Saskatchewan found evidence  the new coronavirus could harm North American bats already weakened by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that has killed millions of bats on this continent.   Researcher horrified by discovery of deadly white-nose syndrome in Manitoba bats   \"We looked at levels of the naturally occurring coronavirus that our little brown bats carry around. It doesn't make us sick, it doesn't appear to make the bat sick.  But when we looked at bats that were suffering from white-nose syndrome, they were expressing about 60 times as much virus as healthy, controlled bats,\ " Willis said.  \"That's a bit of a worry.\ " The transmission of viruses from animals to people is a consequence of wildlife habitat loss, where human development pushes into what used to be natural areas, Willis said. Wildlife markets that confine stressed animals within a small space present a perfect opportunity for pathogens to jump from one species to another, he said. This risk is also increased by climate change, as animals move into environments that were once inhospitable to them.   'Worse' pandemic on horizon unless world deals with wildlife markets   Willis is encouraging Canadians in rural areas to help researchers keep track of bat populations, especially now that the pandemic has sidelined biologists. \"Now that we're not able to go out and do fieldwork, it would be amazing if people can help us count their bats,\ " he said, noting the mammals are starting to emerge from their hibernacula, which include bat houses on private properties. \"That's something people can do. And it's really fun to do with your kids as a science project, [for] your home schooling.\" Willis warned rural residents not to violate public-health advisories against travel or to wander onto other people's property. Some of Canada's bat biologists maintain a citizen-science website at batwatch.ca. 
  In the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government announced Monday it is pumping $23 million into an academic research lab in Saskatchewan.   The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan started as a modest veterinary lab in 1975. But it has evolved into a world class facility that the Trudeau government is betting can develop a vaccine to stop the pandemic. The Saskatoon lab already has a head start. It has been working on coronavirus vaccines, primarily for animals, for four decades, including successful vaccines for cattle and pigs. Today, the vaccine centre is one of only a few high-level containment facilities in the world able to conduct research on a vaccine for COVID-19. PhotosGo inside the high-security lab where scientists search for a coronavirus vaccine In a wide-ranging interview Friday, VIDO-InterVac research scientist Darryl Falzarano and associate director Paul Hodgson told CBC News that in the past, generating interest in funding research into a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans has been a challenge. While the focus is now on stopping COVID-19, Hodgson said finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine is their \"vision statement,\" much like a universal flu vaccine has been a goal of scientists for decades.   \"That's something we've never been able to get funding for,\" said Falzarano. Falzarano, left, says the lab's goal has long been to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. (Bonnie Allen/CBC) But that has all changed, at least for the foreseeable future. Today, there are 160 people working at the lab — and up to 30 per cent of them are working on a coronavirus vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada gave VIDO-InterVac the green light to start researching a vaccine for humans in late January. Researchers isolated the virus from a sample and have since grown the virus in a cell culture and are now testing a vaccine candidate in animals. One of the questions Hodgson says he gets asked frequently these days is, \"Why can't you do a vaccine faster?\ " The answer is complicated. WATCH  | Why we're likely in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. What mathematical simulations tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play in the real world. 5:04 The federal government's multimillion-dollar funding announcement, part of a global push to develop a vaccine, comes in the middle of an international health crisis that has already killed more than 18,000 people worldwide.  As of Tuesday, Canada had more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases, resulting in 27 deaths. Over the past two decades there have been global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses. But when the outbreaks subsided, so did the research into a vaccine. MERS outbreak: 3 lessons Canada learned from SARSCanadian, U.S. scientists debate cause of SARS In 2003, VIDO-InterVac was part of the rush to develop a SARS vaccine in Canada, dubbed the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative. Although promising candidates were developed in a relatively short period of time, ultimately a vaccine for SARS was never put through trials and no vaccine exists today.     \"Until MERS came along [in 2012], there probably wasn't that strong of evidence that a coronavirus would be something that we should worry about, and that's going to happen again,\ " Falzarano said. VIDO-InterVac associate director Paul Hodgson says finding funding for the lab's coronavirus research has been difficult in the past. (VIDO-InterVac) Hodgson said scientists are using knowledge gained from SARS and MERS. But for years prior to the current outbreak, finding a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans wasn't a priority for governments or the big pharmaceutical companies.  And when it comes to finding vaccines, the research follows the money. Two years ago, VIDO-InterVac earned a four-year grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the federal government's funding agency. The government of Saudi Arabia also kicked in grant money. The research project?  A vaccine that stops the transmission of MERS from camels to humans. Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses \"We've been working more immediately on MERS vaccines and always moving, very slowly, looking at different ways you could start to try to sell the concept better of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,\ " Falzarano said. \"It's disappointing to me. It's something that I planned to do when I worked here and then it seemed clear that nobody was too interested in [funding] that concept.\" Now, funding vaccine research has become imperative. The Trudeau government has committed $11 million to VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research and an additional $12 million to increase manufacturing capabilities for clinical trials. According to Hodgson, Canada's capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically is concerning. Researchers at VIDO InterVac use alpacas as part of their MERS vaccine research on transmission from camels to humans. (VIDO-InterVac) \"From a national security or emergency preparedness perspective, the manufacturing capacity we have has really started to go down,\ " Hodgson said. VIDO-InterVac had been pushing the Canadian government to increase manufacturing capacity. ' Our ultimate goal' Three times a week, scientists from the Saskatoon lab start their long day on an early morning conference call with the World Health Organization as they spearhead Canada's contribution to the global effort to find a vaccine. So far, Canada is one of 10 countries participating in a research network the WHO calls Solidarity, which is sharing COVID-19 vaccine research. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference Friday that international co-operation will provide the level of data necessary to determine the most effective treatments. As of Friday, neither the U.S. nor China were listed by the WHO as participating in the Solidarity trials. Back at VIDO-InterVac, the team is focused squarely on developing a vaccine to protect the world.   \"That's our ultimate goal,\ " Hodgson said. \"It would be fantastic if we developed a cure and made $100 million and were self-sufficient from this point forward, but our vision is protecting Canada and the world from infectious diseases.\"
  As Manitoba confirms its first cases of the new coronavirus, public health officials are urging every Manitoban to play their part in slowing the virus's spread. So far, Manitoba has 15 presumptive and lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Some of the advice is familiar from flu seasons gone by — wash your hands, cough into your sleeve and stay home when you're sick. But Manitobans are also being urged to practise something less familiar: social distancing, a set of techniques officials say could help control the virus. Dr. Brent Roussin, the province's chief provincial public health officer, said the strategies are based on how the virus gets transmitted. What Manitobans need to know about COVID-19 \"This virus, in the community setting, is almost exclusively transmitted through those who have symptoms, and through close contact with those who have symptoms,\ " Roussin said on March 13. \"Even when we can't take every single precaution, if everyone's taking the precautions they can, we're going to dramatically reduce the impact of this virus.\ " Here's a breakdown of what that means. What is social distancing? Social distancing is most easily understood as deliberately creating more space between people, said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba. That works on two levels. The first is keeping one person physically farther from another to limit spread of illness between them. The other is limiting the size of social gatherings, which accomplishes the first goal while also ensuring that if new cases happen, they don't happen all at once. The latter goal has been called \"flattening the curve\ " — spreading out the cases of illness over time, so the health-care system can handle cases as they come. Social distancing techniques vary widely, from avoiding handshakes to going into isolation. In Manitoba, public health officials have announced school, daycare and casino closures and are discouraging gatherings of more than 50 people, as of March 17. COVID-19: Latest on closures and more in ManitobaNo school for Manitoba K-12 students for 3 weeks starting March 23 They're also asking the public to use a few techniques in particular:   Minimize prolonged contact (more than 10 minutes) and close contact (less than two metres) with others in public. Avoid greetings that involve touching, like handshakes or hugs. Follow public health advice on self-monitoring and self-isolation if you've travelled or have been exposed to someone with the virus. Avoid all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.   Other organizations are also bringing in social distancing measures. Universities are moving to online classes, for example, while Landmark Cinemas at Grant Park is only selling 50 per cent of seats in its movie theatres so people can sit farther apart.   These measures are different from standard flu precautions like washing your hands, but they're all based on the way scientists believe the virus is transmitted: through large droplets of mucus or saliva that carry it from the respiratory tract of an infected person into the respiratory tract of someone else. Kindrachuk said scientists believe that for a number of reasons. One is the fact that this coronavirus — officially called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19 — seems to behave like many other viruses in the coronavirus family. Examples are SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). WATCH | How social distancing can help prevent the spread of COVID-19: Social distancing measures like working from home, school closures and cancelling sporting events could lead to a drop of new infections of coronavirus. 1:54 \"Because of the similarities … amongst all the different coronaviruses, what we can say is pretty definitively that this virus is also spread by respiratory droplets,\ " he said. Washing your hands, avoiding touching your face and cleaning frequently touched surfaces are ways to prevent infected droplets from getting into your respiratory tract — or into someone else's — through touch. Covering coughs and standing farther away from people, meanwhile, prevents spread through droplets in the air. Why two metres? This part is based on scientists' understanding of those large droplets, and how they behave once they've been coughed or sneezed out into the air. \"The easiest way to explain it … comes across, maybe, a little bit gross,\" said Kindrachuk. But, like many flu prevention techniques, it's simple to understand. When infected people cough or sneeze, they spray the droplets from their respiratory tract, he explained. Due to their size, those droplets can only travel so far — which scientists think is about two metres, or six feet. Why do scientists think this will work? Planning for how to tackle this new coronavirus comes from a few different sources. Those include an understanding of how other coronaviruses behave, lessons learned from previous pandemics, and early research on the new coronavirus itself. \"In the wake of the pandemics of influenza in the latter half of the 20th century, we started to realize that transmission seemed to be … more frequent in large gatherings, and particularly when those gatherings happened in enclosed spaces,\" said Dr. Matthew Oughton, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill University. Attractions closed, events cancelled as Winnipeg organizations respond to coronavirus4 COVID-19 cases confirmed in Manitoba, chief provincial public health officer says It's hard to study pandemics, and scientists still don't know everything about the new coronavirus, said Oughton, who is also an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. That means there's a limited evidence base for scientists and public health officials to use to guide decisions. But Canada has the advantage of past experiences with pandemics, such as SARS and H1N1, as well as a strong health-care system, he said. \"We don't have that sort of strength of randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,\ " he said, but the recommended techniques are based on \"accumulated decades of research, looking at transmission of various viruses or infections in different … limited populations, and extrapolation to what seems to make sense.\ "  We still see people coughing into their hands, which makes me think that people don't really understand.- Dr. Annalee Yassi, UBC Dr. Annalee Yassi, a professor and Canada Research Chair at the school of population and public health at the University of British Columbia, said the behaviour of the new coronavirus so far also supports scientists' beliefs about how it works. For example, if it was aerosolized (carried by air, rather than through droplets), it would likely have infected far more people, said Yassi, who is also a specialist in public health and occupational medicine. \"It's being followed very, very carefully now, because we're really in the midst of things and it's easier to look in hindsight,\ " Yassi said. But \"everything that we see epidemiologically, as well as what we know about the virus, suggests that that's mode of spread.\" Dr. Joel Kettner, the province's former chief public health officer, said officials need to weigh many factors — including expected severity of an illness and how effective management will be — before implementing major measures. He wants to hear more about how policy decisions have been made here. \"I'd like to see more about what [infection] numbers are and … the sort of range of scenarios that are being prepared for,\" he said. \"And then I would like to see more of the rationale and expectations of each of these different social distancing measures that are being done.\" What else can I do? Yassi stressed the importance of following public health advice, including the advice that wearing masks won't provide benefit to members of the public. The masks could actually do more harm than good, she added, because people wearing them are more likely to touch their faces as they fidget with the masks. What's more, they're needed by health-care workers who could actually benefit from them. Hand-washing and practising good cough etiquette — coughing or sneezing into your sleeve, for example — are still essential tools, she said, even if they seem simple.

That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 \"We still see people coughing into their hands, which makes me think that people don't really understand,\ " Yassi said. \"Yes, things are intuitive. But … some of these things are not as common practice as we would like them to be.\" Oughton said it's critical for the public to follow the advice of health officials and doctors. \"This virus is proving, in a way, that we are all connected,\" he said. \"And if everyone can contribute and collaborate to this, we're all going to get through this. It's going to take some work, but we're going to make it through the other side.\"  
  In the past few weeks, as Vancouverites were encouraged to stay at home and only cautiously enjoy parks and outdoor spaces to avoid spreading the virus behind a catastrophic global pandemic, the city was treated to a spell of beautiful weather, with much clearer skies than normal.

On social media, people commented on the lack of condensation trails left by airplanes, and the clear views of distant mountains.

Light wind doesn't blow away pollution, there's no rain wash to it away, and the \"lid\" the high pressure system creates traps pollution lower down. \"And yet at the same time we have literally seen with our eyes improved air quality — the skies have been clearer; in the Fraser Valley, Mount Baker has been just stunning scene,\ " he said. \"This has been repeated all over much of the province and in fact all over much of the world.\" So strange (but beautiful) to see such a blue sky with no trace of airplane contrails.. ✈️ ☀️ < a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/homogenituscloud?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#homogenituscloud</a> The last time the sky was this clear of planes was 9/11... <a href=\"https://t.co /yqGg9UR0v2\">pic.twitter.com/yqGg9UR0v2</a>&mdash;@JWagstaffe those distant mountains have looked so clear lately. may be reduced air pollution from Vancouver. closer, on the right, is Chocolate Beach, a wee Salt Spring Island treat. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ StayHome?src= hash&amp;ref_src =twsrc%5Etfw\">#StayHome</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ JUIBXuxCOI\">pic.twitter.com/JUIBXuxCOI</a>&mdash;@Raffi_RC Steyn said, for example, there have recently been rare Himalayan vistas in northern India, and clearer views of the Alps in northern Italy. But he doesn't rely solely on anecdotes and a perception of cleaner air — Steyn is also doing the research. He has looked at the nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide levels — clear markers of emissions from vehicles — at two busy Vancouver sites: Clark Drive at 11th Avenue, which is a trucking thoroughfare, and Robson Square in downtown Vancouver, which is in the midst of plenty of personal vehicle traffic. Air pollution drops as countries shut down amid spread of COVID-19 Based on data gathered by Metro Vancouver from March 21 to April 16 this year and last year, there are definitely improvements this year. Robson Square is pictured on Wednesday, March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization began calling the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The plaza — normally surrounded by bustling vehicle traffic — in the heart of downtown Vancouver serves as a air quality monitoring site. (Ben Nelms/CBC) \"When we do the analysis, we discover that 2020 is notably cleaner,\" said Steyn, adding that the weather in 2019 was typical for spring in Vancouver and punctuated by rain. Steyn said in Metro Vancouver, air quality is primarily affected by vehicles on the road, and to a certain degree airplanes. The province relies largely on hydroelectric power generation, meaning coal burning and other dirtier power sources aren't a major issue. Satellite data shows air pollution drop in Europe amid COVID-19 lockdowns He considers the restrictions put in place as part of the response to COVID-19 sort of a massive involuntary experiment, and the results can help inform how major challenges like climate change and unhealthy pollution can be addressed.   \"This experiment will be very powerful in helping understand how future reductions in emissions — not through some pandemic but through actions of the citizens — how those will result in improved air quality,\ " said Steyn. COVID-19 restrictions cut downtown Toronto pollution levels by almost half, researchers find \"It would be terribly sad if a new normal were like the old normal, because the old normal was not a particularly desirable one — for both air pollution and global warming,\ " he said. Douw Steyn, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at the University of British Columbia, discusses whether a return to normal after the pandemic mus include a return to normal emissions and poor air quality. 1:13 Steyn is not advocating for economic activity to cease, nor is he celebrating the pandemic and the toll it has taken on people's lives — he's eager to see a return to a healthy society.

(Justin Heiman/Getty Images) Questions about outdoor COVID-19 transmission risks grow as weather improves As millions of Canadians eye the imminent arrival of better weather and feel the effects of six weeks stuck largely at home, some are wondering whether spending more time outdoors is a risk worth taking. Research about the likelihood of outdoor transmission of the virus is virtually non-existent. While crowded outdoor spaces pose a clear risk of infection, there is little doubt that COVID-19 spreads far more easily indoors than outdoors. The competing priorities of urging people to stay at home to prevent infections and the mental health costs of spending too much time indoors, mixed with the unclear risks of outdoor transmission, have public health officials struggling to craft a clear and consistent message. B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, told people in her province on Wednesday to go outdoors. \"The risk [of catching the virus] would be infinitesimally small if somebody walks by you, runs by you — even if they are within six feet,\ " she said. Her Ontario counterpart was less definitive; Dr. David Williams said it's important that people who go outside do so in ways that allow for physical distancing. \"Don't go to places where you think everybody else is going to go. Don't go at hours when everybody else is going,\ " he said. While evidence about outdoor transmission of the virus is lacking, research \"has consistently shown that transmission is strongly dependent on being in close proximity to a sick person for some period of time,\" the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health said. The centre, a Vancouver-based team of researchers funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, is sounding caution about the negative effects of limiting people's access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of making more outdoor space available, Toronto is lessening it by shutting its largest park starting today. The closure of High Park is to prevent crowds from gathering around groves of cherry trees to view their blossoms. Dr. Eileen De Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, has rejected calls that the city close downtown streets to traffic to free up more room for pedestrians, saying it could encourage people to congregate on the closed streets.

Physically prohibited from being with their loved ones in their final moments, they are saying goodbye on phones, screens or, in some cases, not at all. The story of COVID-19 in Canada is more than a graph. Each of those data points represents a hole in the lives of a Canadian family who are now forced to mourn at a distance. For several weeks, a team of CBC journalists has been keeping track of those who died, trying to find out as much as we can about who these people were in an effort to tell their stories. Unlike many other countries, Canada has an incomplete picture of the toll of COVID-19, writes CBC News editor in chief Brodie Fenlon​​​​. As part of the Lives Remembered project, CBC News is setting out to learn who is being disproportionately affected and to help everyone understand how to deal with this pandemic in the months ahead. If you would like your loved one's information included in our data set, please email covid-data@cbc.ca. Read more stories from the Lives Remembered project   Did the WHO mishandle the global coronavirus pandemic? The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, with threats of funding cuts and investigations into its conduct. But experts say that while the WHO may have made some missteps in its handling of the crisis, the organization is only as powerful as its weakest link. In 2005, the WHO's responsibilities increased with the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legal agreement signed by all members that requires countries to report emerging disease outbreaks that are at risk of spreading worldwide. In doing so, experts say the WHO took on a more political role in juggling the domestic interests of its individual members with the interests of the rest of the world. \"They have never performed well in that function — not once,\ " said Amir Attaran, a professor in the faculties of law and school of epidemiology and public health at the University of Ottawa. While the WHO considered an emergency declaration in January, Chinese officials acted swiftly to silence early informal releases of information from health-care workers sounding the alarm in Wuhan. \"You never want to give bad news to your boss in China,\" said former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney. He said that highlights an inherent issue within the WHO: it can be \"stonewalled\" by a member country on the release of information — posing a \"significant risk\" at a critical time in an outbreak.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald unveiled the provincial government's five-stage plan for relaxing public health restrictions, including conditions that need to be met as the province progresses from present conditions — what it calls Level 5 — to living with COVID-19 — Level 1. The government's alert system comes as the province marks the fourth straight day with no new COVID-19 cases. Effective today, Newfoundland and Labrador residents can expand their household \"bubble\ " — the immediate group people live and interact with under public health restrictions — to one other household to interact with, provided the other household agrees. Each household can interact only with each other. The provincial government has set May 11 as the target date for moving to Level 4, provided several conditions, are met, including widely available testing and capacity in the health system to handle the caseload. Should the conditions be met, Level 4 includes the relaxation of restrictions on low-risk outdoor recreational activities, low-risk non-essential businesses and the resumption of some medical procedures in regional health authorities. No target date has been set for Level 3 or lower.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Right now, evidence strongly suggests the antibodies we are producing do indeed provide us with some sort of immunity, according to Matthew Miller, associate professor in the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University. \"The real questions are for how long does that protection last,\ " he said. \"I think that's sort of a bigger issue.\" Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases specialist at the University Health Network, agreed. \"I believe we will make a vaccine for this and that the antibodies that people produce will very likely provide some level of protection. The question is how much protection and for how long.\" Bogoch said doctors and scientists are focusing on the lifespan of the antibodies because the coronavirus does in fact mutate. That means antibodies you created to fight off the virus the first time you are exposed may not be effective the next time. But Miller added that antibodies aren't the only part of your immune system that protects you from the virus. \"There are also these cells called T-cells and they can help provide protection as well,\" he said. \"It's kind of a mixture of antibodies and T-cells that do the work for your immune system in order to protect it.\" AND FINALLY... Teachers in Steinbach, Man., surprise graduating students at their homes With social isolation, teachers say they wanted to give the students a pick-me-up so the school organized the early morning surprise to celebrate the graduating class. 1:35 Grade 12 students from Steinbach Regional Secondary School in southeastern Manitoba woke up to a big surprise Wednesday, as some of their teachers showed up with lawn signs saying \"congratulations.\" With the school's normal graduation activities postponed for now because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the school organized the early morning gesture to celebrate the graduating class. \"I think our grads need a pick-me-up. It's been tough work for them at home, being distanced from their friends and normal routine,\ " said Sherry Bestvater, co-principal of the school. The teachers started decorating their cars early in the morning with yellow ribbons and balloons and banners displaying the school's logo, the sabre, on them. Some teachers held signs that said \"SRSS Grad 2020\ " while the parade of cars went down Main Street honking and cheering. \"[I] was not expecting that. It's really nice to know that our school is doing everything they can for all the grad students,\" student Parker Rempel said.
