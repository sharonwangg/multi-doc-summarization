  A Winnipeg medical team has designed a new mask for health-care workers that could help replace the N95 masks Manitoba is running out of amid the COVID-19 pandemic — but the province still needs to find someone to make them. \"Last week was particularly challenging, and a bit of a wake-up call, that we cannot rely on our typical processes and our usual practices,\" said Manitoba Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa at a news conference Saturday afternoon. The new mask prototype was designed by a team of medical experts at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre led by plastic surgeon Dr. Christian Petropolis. The announcement about the new mask design came four days after Siragusa said the province was a week or two away from using up the rest of its N95 masks and some other personal protective equipment (PPE).   (CBC) Manitoba is seeking submissions from local manufacturers that would be able to start making the new masks as soon as possible. The province said it will sign purchase orders totalling up to $15 million to pre-order the masks, and may supply some of these funds in advance to supplement start-up costs. WATCH | Lanette Siragusa says province is taking steps to address PPE shortage: Manitoba Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa said the province’s stockpile of protective gear has been depleted by global pressures. 0:59 Petropolis said the mask is reusable and as effective as commercially produced N95 masks. It has a silicone base and uses an N95 — or higher —grade filter. \"The advantage of this design is its simplicity and flexibility.  The small disk filter uses considerably less N95 material, the main component which has led to a worldwide mask shortage,\" said Petropolis, who is also the program training director for plastic surgery at the University of Manitoba.    (CBC) The province expanded its efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 among its health-care workers even further on Saturday, announcing that health-care workers who show respiratory symptoms can now go directly to test sites, show their ID and immediately be swabbed for COVID-19. Siragusa said as the province keeps ramping up its efforts to fight COVID-19, she expects the need for volunteers will grow. She said Manitoba will soon be reaching out to volunteer organizations to find people who can help. Total cases now at 243 Health officials also announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in Manitoba on Saturday, bringing the province's total to 243. Eight people are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care units. Chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin said as of Saturday, 96 people have recovered from the disease caused by the new coronavirus and four people have died.   (CBC) That brings the province's number of active COVID-19 cases to 143. Roussin said he doesn't believe any of the new cases are health-care workers, but he said investigations into those cases are still ongoing.

  A group of volunteers in Fort Smith, N.W.T, are working together to bring groceries to those in self-isolation.   Alex Pryor has been hearing some concerns from members of the St. John's Anglican Church about COVID-19, as cases continued to spread in the provinces. That's when Pryor, who's a rector at the church, decided to act.   \"If the church is who we say we are … if we are supposed to be the hands of Christ in the world , then we should be the hands getting your groceries,\ " Pryor said.   'Make sure that everyone is taken care of' Pryor reached out to Kevin MacDonald, the Northern Store manager and a member of his church, to see what they could do for the community.   A few days later, the store announced on Facebook that it would be delivering grocery store items to seniors, elders and those in quarantine.     Northern and Northmart stores freezing prices for 60 days    MacDonald said the delivery program is for the good of the community.   \"We want to make sure that everyone is taken care of, as much as we can,\ " MacDonald said. The Northern Store takes orders by phone, then packs all of the groceries into a box for the quarantined people. Staff will ask every caller about their symptoms, whether they've been tested and if they are in self-isolation.   One of the boxes delivered by Pryor to community members in Fort Smith. He's working with the town's Northern Store to fill orders for people in self-isolation.   (Submitted by Alex Pryor) Customers will pay through their existing store accounts, which will limit the human interaction between those delivering groceries and those living in quarantine. Then, Pryor and his volunteers pick up the boxes and deliver them to the correct address.   Volunteers wear gloves, face masks The volunteer will ring the doorbell or knock on the door, and will leave the groceries on the doorstep for people to pick up.   Pryor said volunteers are wearing gloves and, in some cases, a face mask, in order to make all the deliveries safely and to minimize any potential spread.    Volunteers will also be asked to self-monitor for any symptoms of the virus, Pryor continued.   If demand increases, MacDonald said he will re-direct staff members at his store away from their other duties to take and fill out the orders.   Pryor has assembled a list of six young volunteers that are able to help shoulder the load, including Sarah Nichol, who does technical paperwork for  Northwestern Air Lease Ltd. Nichol said this kind of response is expected from her community.   N.W.T. shuts its borders as 1st case of COVID-19 confirmed in territory \"It just so happens it's because of the coronavirus, but our town is really closely knit,\ " she said. \"We would have helped out if this was necessary at any other time.\ "  MacDonald said their initiative has gotten a positive reaction from people in town but it's too soon to tell how much need there is in the community. The territory announced its first case of COVID-19 Saturday. 
  Steven Li had spent 11 days holed up in his apartment in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. So on Sunday, he decided to take a short bike ride to pick up groceries. \"I just wanted some chocolate, to be honest,\ " Li told CBC Radio's Metro Morning today.

  For Toronto-based Spirit of York Distillery Co., transforming from a gin and vodka manufacturing plant into a hand-sanitizing producer wasn't a particularly difficult transition. It took some time to secure sufficient quantities of hydrogen peroxide and glycerine, two of the ingredients needed to make the much sought after product. But the company certainly has enough ethanol and distilled water in stock to complete the recipe recommended by the World Health Organization. \"It wasn't challenging from a process perspective,\" said company founder Gerry Guitor. Spirit of York is just one of a number of distilleries in Canada that have decided to switch gears of production and help manufacture hand sanitizer, now in short supply because of the coronavirus pandemic. Federal cabinet considers leveraging military in mobilizing health manufacturing sector against COVID-19'Demand's been high': Niagara distiller making free hand sanitizer for police, health-care workers, others Hiram Walker & Sons announced Thursday that it too would add hand sanitizer to its product line. Just days ago, Paris-based luxury goods maker LVMH said it would also make the item. Spirit of York in Toronto is among several distilleries in Canada that have started making hand sanitizer to help meet increased demand due to the novel coronavirus. 4:33 But the outbreak has created shortages in other vital medical items, including masks and ventilators. With the current manufacturers of such products unable to meet demand, companies in other industries are being called upon to fill the void. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government will implement a new strategy to provide support to companies already making such products in order to ramp up production. As part of this new plan, Ottawa will also support manufacturers who want to retool their facilities to make these items, he said. Canada to turn back asylum seekers, close border at midnight to stop spread of COVID-19Ottawa unveils plan to harness industry to ramp up production of COVID-19 medical gear However, switching gears and producing such products in a timely manner could be challenging for many plants.   The challenge is the speed in which we need these things.- Dennis Darby, president of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters \"The challenge is the speed in which we need these things,\" said Dennis Darby, president of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME). \"Everyone is looking at the logistics of doing it. How long will it take?  Can we get the parts?  Can we get the materials?\ " This ventilator at Humber River Hospital is one of about 1,300 across Ontario. Companies are being asked to switch gears and help manufacture the equipment. (Craig Chivers/CBC) ' The only hurdle is time and money' Flavio Volpe, president of Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association, said he believes his members are up to the task, and that at least 15 companies have committed to produce medical equipment. Medical products aren't any more sophisticated than automotive parts, he said, and all his members need are the specifications of the products. \"The only hurdle is time and money, and I think we've got more than enough of the latter, and I guess we've got to do what we can with the former.\" \"If we had the specifications and you could source the tooling from the same places the original equipment manufacturers get them, you could turn this around in a matter of a few short weeks, \" he said. Yet, that timeframe projection could be somewhat optimistic. \"If you think about the next month, the next two to four weeks, for example, it would be hard for me to see somebody switching over to a new product line, getting the inputs and then getting it to their distributors over that time period,\" said Kenneth Wong, a marketing professor at Queen's University. \"It's not just a case of changing inputs. There's new order protocols. You may need new equipment. Differing responsibilities.\" Fraser Johnson, a professor of operations management at Western University's Ivey Business School, said with the engineering and manufacturing talent in Canada and the United States, there's no question that some plants could shift production to make medical products like ventilators. \"But I don't think you can snap your fingers and get there next month,\ " he said. Face masks are also in short supply. (Submitted by Kyle Saikaley) Companies already making distilled products like alcohol, have an easier time to transition to things like hand sanitizer, he said. For the other medical items, however, \"you need a source of raw materials,\" said Johnson. \"You need designs. You need specifications. You need to retrain your workers. You need even simple things like packaging.\ " If a factory was to start producing medical face masks, for example, it would require the resources to convert polypropylene into the material needed for the mask. It would need the metals for the metal rim around the mask and the band to hold the mask in place, he said. \"Now, it's probably going to take me at least a couple of months to be able to set it up, the very minimum. Maybe a Herculean effort, I can do it faster. But I can't snap my fingers and do that if I haven't made face masks.\" \"I've got to think about all the nuance that companies like 3M have been working on literally for decades.\" Ford, and other manufacturers, could be called upon to produce medical equipment in short supply   (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) Share intellectual property with other companies? And manufacturing ventilators, of course, would be a much more complicated and time-consuming process, Johnson said. A car manufacturer doesn't have the capability of being able to make the electronics and some of the other sophisticated equipment that goes into the creation of such a product, he said. Workers would have to be retrained, new assembly lines built up, and then there's the time it would take to test the new product for safety. (Meanwhile, adding to the issues, some car manufacturers have suspended plant operations because of the virus.) As well, there could be issues of how much manufacturers of ventilators are willing to share their intellectual property with other companies.   Johnson said he predicted it could take at least six months before the first new ventilator rolled off the assembly line. CME's Darby said some point to the example of the Second World War and how General Motors made weapons to support the U.S. war effort. \"Well, that was a bit different. First of all, for a manufacturer to switch over to produce tanks and guns, they had months to do it,' he said. \"And there was no problem bringing people into plants because there was no worry about COVID- 19, so they were able to bring the crews in and put in a whole pile of money at the time — billions of dollars to capitalize all the production of munitions.\" Another hindrance is that because of the pandemic's impact on the economy, manufacturers are trying deal with their own manufacturing struggles, he said. \"Getting them to put their heads around: 'OK, I know you're having your challenges, right now. How long would it take? What would it look like to get the machinery in to make these other items?'

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   As COVID-19 continues its deadly spread across the country, health-care workers on the front lines of the pandemic are having to adapt their behaviour in a variety of ways, both in hospital and at home. The highly contagious virus that surrounds them on a daily basis informs nearly every decision and every action. The overriding goal is to help patients who are suffering, while also protecting themselves and others, including their loved ones, from catching COVID-19.    Whether it's how they interact with critically ill patients, including how often; how they eat their meals while on duty; and what they do before they even walk in the door at home after a shift — nearly every routine has changed.   At the system level, Canada is adapting to the crisis by expanding hospital capacity, training staff for new roles and inviting retired health-care workers to return to duty. Down at individual level, Patty Tamlin of Stouffville, Ont. , knows what's at stake. She works as an intensive care nurse in the Scarborough Health Network's Birchmount site in Toronto's east end.  Tamlin, 59, was infected with SARS on the job in 2003. Toronto intensive care nurse Patty Tamlin, left, says if she doesn't have the protective equipment she needs to enter a COVID-19 room, her family's safety will come first. (Submitted by Patty Tamlin) She won't shy away from caring for patients so long as she's adequately protected with the proper gear, she said. The supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been a persistent concern of hers as the outbreak continues. She's not only concerned about her own safety, but that of her husband, who is recovering from cancer. \"For me, with having somebody who's immunocompromised at home from chemotherapy, I'm obsessive,\ " Tamlin said of the precautions she takes to avoid infection. INTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?    Tamlin's not alone in constantly taking extra care. Hospital workers are meticulous about physical distancing at work, including at lunch. Everyone working in the hospital wears surgical masks. They're given two per day. At lunch, staff remove their mask to eat, either in the regular staff room, in a conference room or in the lobby to keep away from each other.    \"I missed my dinner break [Wednesday] and that will happen more,\ " Tamlin said. \"I am more dehydrated, as I can't step away to get a drink of water as easily.\" Tamlin said everyone tries to stay cheerful and support each other.    When she arrives home after a shift, she leaves her shoes outside, takes off her clothes immediately once inside to put them directly in the wash, and then hits the shower. \"I wash my hair, everything. I even wash my hair tie, even though … my head is covered all day.\" A nurse's armour Tamlin said a big concern is what could happen if a surge in cases on the scale of what happened in Italy or New York City were to occur in Toronto and the supply of N95 masks to treat the sickest patients needed to be rationed.   \"A cop has a vest and a gun,\ " Tamlin said. \"I should have a gown and a mask if I'm going to provide care.\" Tamlin prepares to work with COVID-19 patients in Toronto. (Byron Piedad) When critically ill patients are in distress, they may need to be intubated by having a tube inserted through the mouth and into the airway. During intubation, virus-laden droplets that are smaller than what we expel in a regular cough spread everywhere. That's why health-care workers need to wear N95 masks, face shields and gowns that liquid can't penetrate, as well as plastic aprons on top of their gowns and other PPE. If the supply of aprons were to run out briefly, as it did in one New York City hospital, Tamlin plans to resort to using garbage bags. Care teams shrink Before the pandemic, a team of several doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists would rush into the room if a patient needed to be resuscitated. That was before masks, face shields, gowns, gloves and other gear needed to be preserved.   \"Let's just have the two of us in there,\ " Tamlin said of how critical care teams work now. The PPE needs to be put on and carefully removed between patients, along with handwashing and absolutely no touching one's face. Even a momentary lapse risks exposing a health-care worker to the virus.   Normally, Tamlin would go into a patient's room whenever called. Now, she tells patients that's no longer possible. Instead, she plans to accomplish several tasks in a single visit, such as providing medication, getting blood work, and repositioning a patient in their bed. Tamlin said staff are also trying to use long extension tubes to roll IV pumps out of the room as well, so someone doesn't need to go in to make adjustments. Dr. Bruce Lampard says the tension he feels in his body now resembles what he felt during the height of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.   (Bruno De Cock/MSF) When Tamlin looks at hard-hit New York, she admires how front-line workers from elsewhere in the U.S. are leaving their homes and families to help out.   \"What I see is our future — our relatively immediate future,\" said said, both in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada. On Thursday, health officials in Ontario announced the death of a hospital worker, a grim first for the province. The sheer number of people infected worldwide in the pandemic is a major difference from SARS, Tamlin said. SARS resulted in more than 8,000 cases in 2003, according to the World Health Organization. There are already more than 1.3 million COVID-19 cases globally.   ' Tension in your body' Like Tamlin, Dr. Bruce Lampard, an emergency room physician with Toronto's University Health Network, is constantly taking precautions to guard against the virus. He said he now washes his hands \"hundreds of times a day\" and wipes down everything, including his glasses and cellphone, which he keeps covered in a small plastic bag. He worked in an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone in November 2014 with Doctors Without Borders, and now sits on the group's international board of directors. \"Going to that project in Sierra Leone, there was just that feeling of a little bit of tension in your body and doing your best to try and use it to keep yourself sharp,\" he said. \"I feel the same thing now.\"   Lampard suspects much of the tension he feels comes from the many unknowns of the pandemic. He said lingering questions about the extent people pass on COVID-19 to others before showing symptoms — or in cases where they seemingly have no symptoms at all — provoke some anxiety. Still, he keeps a positive outlook and sleeps soundly, confident in his training, he said. In harm's way Dr. Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association, said he's hearing from physicians across the country about how the uncertainty surrounding supplies of PPE adds to the stress and anxiety they're feeling. Doctors, nurses demand government fill 'unacceptable' gaps in protective gear on front linesCBC Investigates'I was made to feel belittled': Nurses reveal fears working on front lines of COVID-19 pandemic Buchman said he wants to see more equipment and information about supply levels so health workers can prepare.   \"Ethically,\" he said, \"there's a reciprocity on the government's end, on society's end, to provide that personal protective equipment to those health-care workers on the front line to protect them when they put themselves in harm's way.\ " WATCH | What you need to know about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic: ' The point of the mask,' says Christopher Labos, 'is to protect others from you,' especially if you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. 2:58 As a side gig, Tamlin also usually serves as a host at a community radio station. She recently recorded a public service announcement. The message? \"Stay the heck at home … so that I don't have to look after as many people.\"   To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe.

INTERACTIVE | How Canada compares with other countries at flattening the curve How will the global coronavirus pandemic end?   For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause severe symptoms such as pneumonia.   The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says the situation is evolving daily and the risk to Canadians from COVID-19 is \"considered high.\ " Row over masks Trudeau on Saturday also addressed concerns about the urgent need for medical protective equipment to help curb the spread of COVID-19, saying a large shipment of masks will be headed to Canada soon.   \"In the next 48 hours, we will be receiving a shipment of millions of masks by a chartered cargo flight. We're also working with provinces to transport their medical supplies when possible,\ " Trudeau said Saturday at his daily media briefing just outside his Rideau Cottage residence in Ottawa.   \"Our government has also leased a warehouse in China to help collect and distribute these items as quickly as possible.\" A spokesperson for Procurement Minister Anita Anand confirmed to CBC News that the plane would be travelling from China bearing millions of surgical masks, as well as other supplies intended for Quebec-based companies.   WATCH | Why N95 masks are so important : The Trump administration is telling one of the world's leading manufacturers of N95 masks that it should stop exporting masks to Canada and Latin America. 2:43 U.S. President Donald Trump issued an order Friday, telling Minnesota-based 3M to stop supplying N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America. Trump said he wants the masks reserved strictly for U.S. health-care workers. Trudeau said the federal government has been \"very clearly\" communicating to the Trump administration that it is critical not to disrupt the two-way flow of essential goods and services.  On Saturday, Trudeau said he would be speaking with Trump again \"in the coming days.\" Canadian officials, he said, have been talking to people at \"all levels\" of the Trump administration to ensure essential medical equipment can move freely.   Here's a look at what's happening in the provinces and territories Canada has more than 14,000 cases confirmed and presumptive cases, with 274 deaths.

(Associated Press) Brazil health officials grappling with the coronavirus outbreak have issued a stark warning about a lack of hospital beds, masks, testing devices and trained staff across Latin America's largest nation. A report published Friday night said Brazil can currently carry out 6,700 tests a day, but that it will need to process as many as 30,000 to 50,000 tests daily during the peak of the outbreak, expected in June. This latest assessment of the public health-care system raises questions about its capacity to face the outbreak in a country of nearly 210 million. It also calls for the maintenance of quarantine measures in states that are most badly hit, challenging President Jair Bolsonaro's more laid-back approach to the virus. As of Saturday afternoon, the health ministry had reported 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 deaths. But the outbreak is still in its early phase, the report said, and the country's hospitals are not ready to handle a peak. Ecuador's government has begun storing the bodies of victims of the coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers as hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil, the centre of the country's outbreak, have already filled morgues and hospitals.

  From Europe to South America, U.S. allies are complaining about the superpower's \"Wild West\" tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers who have already signed deals for vital medical supplies. In France and Germany, senior officials said the United States was paying far above the market price for medical-grade masks, on occasion winning contracts through higher bids even after European buyers believed a deal was done, and Brazil's health minister reported a similar incident. \"Money is irrelevant. They pay any price because they are desperate,\" one high-level official in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling CDU/CSU group told Reuters. A German government source said, \"Americans are on the move, carrying a lot of money.\ " Watch | Trump talks about the U.S.'s stockpile of vital medical supplies : In a Saturday press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump said 3M is making 180 million N95 masks for the United States. 2:26 Since the virus was first recorded in China late last year, the pandemic has spread around the world. Governments in Europe, the Americas and elsewhere are desperately trying to build up supplies for medics, nursing home staff and the public. Now, with global cases surpassing one million and the outbreak exploding in the United States, the competition for precious stocks is intensifying further. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. government is now recommending Americans wear cloth face coverings on a voluntary basis to stem the spread of the virus, but the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend wearing medical-grade masks. He also said he was signing a directive to stop the export of N95 respirator masks, which provide essential protection for health-care workers, and other U.S. medical equipment. U.S.-listed multinational 3M Co. said Friday that the White House had ordered it to stop all shipments to Canada and Latin America of respirators that it manufactures in the U.S., despite what 3M called \"significant humanitarian implications.\" Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said blocking the flow of equipment across the border would be a \"mistake\" that could backfire, noting that the country's health-care professionals go to work in Detroit every day. In another case, an order of 200,000 masks bound for Germany was diverted to the U.S., Berlin Secretary of Interior Andreas Geisel said, calling it an \"act of modern piracy.\ " In a statement Friday, Geisel said the consignment had been \"confiscated\" in Bangkok and said: \"Even in times of global crisis, you shouldn't use Wild West methods.\" However on Saturday, his office rowed back, saying it was still trying to clarify the circumstances of how the masks, which were ordered from a German wholesaler, and not from U.S. manufacturer 3M, had been diverted.

On Thursday, Mandetta said Brazil had finally succeeded in placing a 1.2 billion reais ($319 million Cdn) order for equipment, although it will only be delivered in 30 days. Cash in hand A second German source employed by a company now helping Merkel's government to order masks said the last weekend of March had been a turning point, and drew a link with the U.S.'s increased presence in the market. Contracts no longer guaranteed delivery, the source said, adding: \"Demand is much, much bigger than supply.\" In France, three regional leaders painted a similar picture. Jean Rottner said it was a constant fight to ensure mask orders arrived in his Grand Est region, where the outbreak first took hold before spreading west towards Paris. He said consignments were changing hands at the last minute. Watch | Why N95 masks are so important:   The Trump administration is telling one of the world's leading manufacturers of N95 masks that it should stop exporting masks to Canada and Latin America. 2:43 \"On the [airport] tarmac, the Americans get out their cash and pay three or four times what we have offered,\ " Rottner told radio RTL France on Wednesday.

  With no domestic production of crucial N95 masks for health-care workers on the COVID-19 front lines, Canada's federal government is bulk-buying tens of millions of them on the international market to meet short-term demand. The Trudeau government's announcement Tuesday that it will spend up to $2 billion to procure personal protective equipment — including more than 60 million N95 masks — comes weeks into a global pandemic and raises questions about Canada's emergency preparedness.   Health care workers around the country say they have been rationing the protective N95 masks while they wait for stocks to be replenished. Because there are currently no domestic manufacturers of N95 masks, pressure put on the global supply by the coronavirus pandemic has left Canada in a precarious position. Only medical masks such as those labelled N95, sometimes called respirators, are designed and fitted to filter out the tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce only some aerosol particles. AnalysisAre Canadians ready for sustained sacrifices in the age of COVID-19?

Much of that production is in Aberdeen, S.D. Its subsidiary, 3M Canada, has several manufacturing plants in this country, but according to an online statement, the company does not manufacture N95 masks in any of its Canadian facilities.   CBC News contacted 3M Canada president Penny Wise on Monday to ask whether the company would retool any of its Canadian factories to meet demand in Canada. Wise's office did not answer the question, saying instead that the company had doubled the amount of N95 masks brought into the country during the first three months of 2020. Wise did not say how many masks that is.   N95 masks are designed to filter 95 per cent of airborne particles. (Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters) The federal government announced Tuesday that it \"was in the process of finalizing an agreement\" with the Montreal-based protective equipment manufacturer Medicom to start N95 and surgical mask production in Canada.   \"We need a sustainable, stable supply of these products, and that means making them at home, and we are optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks,\ " Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. Industry Minister Navdeep Bains said at the Tuesday press conference that the ability to produce the masks within Canada remains \"a core objective of ours.\ " Surgical masks only But the proposed Medicom manufacturing site won't be up and running for months. According to the company, neither the location nor the number of facilities that will be producing masks has been decided. It is aiming to start production in early summer.   In the short term, Medicom has a separate agreement with the federal government to supply \"tens of millions\" of surgical masks only. Sask. Health Authority CEO says he knows 'for a fact' staff involved in stealing masks, gloves from hospitalsPoint of View: Patience, please — waiting for cancer surgery during a pandemic Medicom's chief operating officer, Guillaume Laverdure, told CBC News there have been no discussions in the past with governments in Canada about domestic production of protective masks. \"Manufacturing locally is more expensive than importing from China.

  Italy's Roman Catholic Church has reprimanded the government for not allowing the faithful to return to masses at the start of a gradual staged end to Europe's longest coronavirus lockdown. Masses have been banned since early March when Italy closed most commercial activities apart from essentials. A timetable given on Sunday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said funerals could resume from May 4 but must be limited to 15 people and held outdoors if possible. The timetable for May 4 to June 1 made no mention of masses. Italy's bishops, in a strongly worded statement issued late on Sunday night, said they could \"not accept seeing the exercise of freedom of religion being compromised\" and accused the government of \"arbitrarily\" excluding mass from the timetable. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, shown in the lower house of parliament on April 21, said the reopening rollout for May could change if the country sees another spike in COVID-19 infections. (Remo Casilli/Reuters) The statement implied that the bishops felt betrayed, saying they had suggested to the government measures to resume masses while respecting new safety norms.

Many churches open, but not for services Italy's death toll remains the heaviest in Europe, with more than 26,000 dead and almost 200,000 confirmed cases. But the number of new cases has been slowing and the number of patients in intensive care has been falling steadily. The bishops said the government had a duty \"to distinguish between its responsibility to furnish precise health regulations and that of the church, which is called to organize Christian community life in respect of (health) norms but in full autonomy.\ " In response, the government acknowledged the bishops' complaint and said it would study how to let believers participate safely in liturgical functions \"as soon as possible.\" WATCH | Increased testing, change of habits needed for reopening: 'There will be re-infections,' says Dr. Christopher Labos, but if they can be identified early, he says it should help with efforts to contain the virus.    5:26 Most of Italy's churches have remained open during the crisis, but only for individual prayer. \"If there are ways to work safely, shop safely and do sport safely , there is a way to celebrate mass safely,\" said Paolo Ciani of the small, centrist DEMOS party.

Some U.S. religious leaders flout COVID-19 restrictions with large gatheringsTHE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 27 In mid-March, the cardinal of Rome modified his order to close the capital's churches, even for individual prayer, after Pope Francis cautioned against \"drastic measures\" and Catholics took to social media to complain. The Vatican, which for the most part has been mirroring Italy's containment measures, has not yet said when St. Peter's Basilica or the Vatican museums will reopen. Tension over religious gatherings has been a feature of the pandemic around the world. Clusters of cases have been traced to masses or crowded services in France, Israel, South Korea and the U.S., while some American states with stay-at-home orders have considered religious gatherings to be essential services that can continue, provided physical distancing guidelines are followed. 
  U.S. President Donald Trump announced new federal guidelines on Friday recommending that Americans wear face coverings when in public to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. But then Trump immediately said he had no intention of following the advice himself, saying, \"I'm choosing not to do it.\" The new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages people, especially in areas hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus, to use rudimentary coverings like T-shirts, bandanas and non-medical masks to cover their faces while at the grocery store or pharmacy. The president exempted himself from his administration's own guidelines, saying he could not envision himself covering his face while sitting in the Oval Office, greeting world leaders. \"It's a recommendation , they recommend it,\ " Trump said. \"I just don't want to wear one myself.\ " The new guidance, announced at a time when states are bracing for critical shortfalls like those that other parts of the world have experienced, raises concern that it could cause a sudden run on masks if Americans turn to private industry to meet the expected surge in demand. Trump and other administration officials sought to minimize any burden by stressing the recommendations did not amount to requirements and a variety of homemade coverings were perfectly acceptable. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on April 3 Federal officials stressed that surgical masks and N95 respirators should be left for those on the front lines of fighting the spread of the infection. Friday's announcement capped an evolution in messaging from the White House that officials acknowledged has, at times, been confusing. Melania Trump embodied the ever-changing messaging with a tweet saying, \"As the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing & wearing a mask/face covering seriously.\" The administration has said states should have done more to stockpile medical supplies, but it's not clear if anyone is prepared for the potential rush that could ensue if people try to obtain medical masks for themselves. ' It's very hard to get these products' Trump also announced that he directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prevent the export of N95 masks like those made by manufacturing giant 3M, along with surgical gloves and other anti-viral protective gear. He said exceptions might be made to help Italy and Spain, which have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. \"We are not happy with 3M,\" Trump said. Medical device manufacturer 3M says it is under pressure from the White House to stop exporting N95 masks it currently produces in the United States to other countries, including Canada. N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) The Minnesota-based company said in a news release earlier on Friday that while it welcomes the Trump administration's invocation of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to compel domestic companies to produce critically needed medical infrastructure, it said limiting exports presents \"significant humanitarian implications\" and will backfire by causing other countries to retaliate by withholding supplies from the U.S. Meanwhile, governors and hospital officials around the U.S. have warned of a dire shortage of masks and other protective gear for health care workers treating people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. In rural Florida, Okeechobee Discount Drugs has been sold out of face masks for almost two weeks, and \"we don't know where you can find any masks at this point,\ " said Stacey Nelson, one of the pharmacy's owners. A shopper wears a protective mask outside a supermarket in Chelsea, Mass., on Friday. (Michael Dwyer/The Associated Press) \"It's very hard to get these products, but people want them,\ " Nelson said. \"They've been getting mixed messages and people aren't sure if they should be wearing masks in our daily lives. It's very confusing. Wear them or don't wear them?\" For most people, the novel coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Masks recommendations a moving target In fashioning the recommendations, the Trump administration appears to be striving to balance political concerns about wanting to preserve as much normalcy as possible with public health concerns that some infections are being spread by people who seem to be healthy, which could infect areas that so far have been mostly spared. The White House has faced pushback against rigorous physical distancing guidelines from states with lesser rates of infection. For the hardest-hit areas, where distancing has already been in place for some time, the White House coronavirus task force thought there would be less risk of people ignoring the other guidance if they covered their faces. Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force co-ordinator, said Thursday she was concerned that people would be lulled into a false sense of security by covering their faces, and wouldn't abide by the more critical and effective measures to slow the spread of the virus: staying six feet apart, frequently washing their hands and refraining from touching their faces.

Under the previous guidance, only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the respiratory illness were advised to wear masks. Surgeon General Jerome Adams wrote on Twitter at the end of February that people should \"STOP BUYING MASKS\" and said they were not effective in protecting the general public.

  Saskatchewan's provincial consumer affairs authority is warning businesses that price gouging will result in fines or even potentially incarceration.   \"Grossly excessive pricing of products or services during a period of crisis that takes advantage of consumers who are unable to protect their own interests due to the impact of the crisis is not permitted,\ " the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) said in a statement on Monday. The FCAA said businesses could face action and prosecution if they are found to have engaged in the unfair business practice. Minister of Justice and Attorney General Don Morgan said price gouging during a pandemic is unacceptable and \"Businesses or individuals in Saskatchewan found price gouging will face stiff penalties and possibly jail time.\ "  (Mark Taylor/The Canadian Press) \"During this unprecedented time, it is simply unacceptable to be price gouging,\ " Minister of Justice Don Morgan said in a statement. \"Businesses or individuals in Saskatchewan found price gouging will face stiff penalties and possibly jail time.\"  The FCAA statement said businesses can reasonably raise prices to cover increasing business costs.   If shoppers see price gouging in advertisements or during a shopping trip, they are asked to report it.

Joseph Blondeau, the provincial lead for clinical microbiology with the Saskatchewan Health Authority, said because there's a shortage of medical supplies, N95 masks in particular, they need to be in the hands of frontline healthcare workers, rather than being in the public. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Blondeau said with the federal government stepping in to try and obtain more masks, it's clear to him the masks are not in abundant supply. \"We need to be doing whatever we can to protect the integrity of the N95 mask supply and make sure they're going where they're needed most,\ " he said.   \"That's in the hands of frontline healthcare workers.\ " Blondeau encouraged people to donate unused masks in their original sealed containers. He said a phone line has been set up for people to identify themselves and coordinate a donation.  
  While most people are urged to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, there are others who must go out to help the sick. Health care workers and first responders are trained to care for people in extreme situations, often risking their own health in the process. But screening measures have been put in place to try to protect them from developing COVID-19 Sudbury's paramedic services are prepared for coronavirusDishonest 911 callers put paramedics at risk of COVID-19COVID-19 by the numbers in northeastern Ontario Anyone who calls 911 must answer questions. They include whether the person has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The person is also asked whether they've traveled outside Canada or if they've had contact or exposure with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19. The screening questions provide paramedics, police officers and firefighters with information they need to stay safe when arriving at the call. Melissa Roney is deputy chief of emergency services for the City of Greater Sudbury. (Markus Schwabe/CBC) Melissa Roney, deputy chief of emergency services for the City of Greater Sudbury, urges people to be truthful with they're answering the questions from the 911 communicator. \"If you call 911 and you are positive to those screening questions, you'll see paramedics come in equipped with their [personal protective equipment],\ " she said. First responders are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection from aerosol or droplet contact from COVID-19. This includes goggles, gowns, gloves and N-95 masks. Sudbury doctor makes online plea for N95 masksDon't panic when you see paramedics with masks. It's not necessarily a coronavirus caseSudbury and area agencies work together to prepare for COVID-19 \"We have had some instances where that screening has not been completed and/or not lining up with what they're hearing when they're doing the patient interview,\ " Roney said. \"We understand that sometimes when you're calling 911 it could be the worst day of your life, so people are anxious and stressed out, and maybe not understanding the questions fully.\ " Roney reiterates that first responders will always come to a call, regardless of the answers to those screening questions. \"Be really aware and think about the questions they're asking so we can keep our first responders healthy.\" \"We will come to any call for service to 911\ " Roney adds there will be no difference in response times to get to the call. \"We're going to respond quickly, and be there as fast as we can, however, we may look a little different in terms of donning the necessary equipment with the masks, the gloves, the gown and the eye protection,\ " she said. There is a second set of screening questions, just in case. Along with the 911 screening measures, first responders are also trained to ask the same questions once they arrive at a call to ensure a secondary-layer of safety. \"We will respond, we are going to respond whether a patient is screened positive or not. Absolutely. Our response times stay as they are.\ " Training kicks in According to Roney, over the past week Greater Sudbury paramedics have responded to about two calls per day of suspected COVID-19 cases. \"We will come to any call for service to 911,\" Roney said. \"Our paramedics are doing what they do, and what they're trained to do very well,\" she said. \"This is how we work all of the time.\"
  Canada's chief public health officer and health minister say medical-grade masks need to be reserved for the use of front-line health workers — but it can't hurt for others to wear homemade masks or fabric face coverings , provided they do so properly. \"It's absolutely critical that if people are wearing masks outside — and it certainly is their prerogative to do that, by the way — that we are not taking away masks that are surgical or are specialized that are extremely necessary on the front line, and that we are not using masks in a way ... that is not appropriate,\ " Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday. Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said the supply of medical-grade masks must be preserved for health system workers and those looking after patients infected with COVID-19. \"The effectiveness of the use of non-medical masks hasn't really been well demonstrated,\" said Tam. \"But I think that there may not be any harm in wearing it, if one uses it properly — it's not gaping , it's really well fitted and you practice hygienic measures.\ " 1/7 There is a lot of discussion on use of face masks. It can help to break the discussion into two main considerations regarding the TYPE of mask &amp; the conditions for safe USE of masks in different circumstances/settings. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>&mdash;@CPHO_Canada Until recently, the federal government was saying that masks are unnecessary for those not exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and that non-medical masks, or poorly-fitted medical masks, won't filter out the small airborne particles carrying the virus. Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam say it's up to Canadians themselves to decide whether to wear homemade masks — but the science on their effectiveness is uncertain and the best protection against COVID-19 is still physical distancing.    4:28 But Tam said that the science on the use of masks and other medical responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak is changing. \"From a public health perspective, we need to take in evolution in information in science,\ " she said. \"We've been doing that, and these are the kinds of things that we discuss as a community of practices in terms of the public health and the chief medical officers.\" Ottawa 'likely did not have enough' protective gear stockpiled: HajduINTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 57,000+ cases in Canada on SundayCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would continue to take his advice from health officials but that, in his opinion, wearing a mask could be safer than not wearing one. \"Are you safer with a mask? Absolutely, you're safer.  I can't stand up here and say you would be safer without a mask, so my opinion, you'd be safer with a mask,\ " he said Wednesday. \"But again, I'm going to stick with the advice of the chief medical officer of health and the medical professionals ... \ " Masks have been used extensively in public in countries like China, Japan and South Korea, but the practice is not widespread outside of the region. That changed this week when Austria mandated that all people entering supermarkets or shops must wear masks. Other countries, such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina, have implemented similar measures. The argument against wearing masks in public were outlined by Hajdu and Tam on Wednesday. They insisted that masks that are not properly fitted will let contaminated particles pass. They also fear that masks could give people a false sense of security, leading them to let important hygiene measures slide. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 \"We also know what actually does work already, which is physical distancing,\" said Tam. \"Those droplets fall a certain distance. That's why we've been recommending the two metre distance that actually works. Frequent hand washing absolutely works, not touching your face are absolutely proven measures and everyone should practise those regardless of what else you are adding to those layers of protection.\" Tam and Hajdu also warned that masks have to be removed so that any contagious particles lodged in them don't find their way into someone's mouth or nose. The upside to wearing masks Tam said that there are clear positives to the use of non-medical, cloth or homemade masks.   \"On the one hand, it might potentially reduce you from touching your nose or your mouth, if you've covered up those parts,\" she said. \"But you have to be really careful then that you are not putting your finger in you eye when you're pulling your mask on and off, that you're [not] touching your face in other ways.\ " Masks are probably most useful, Tam said, as a way to catch the cough of someone wearing one, so that potentially infected droplets are not being spread around to other people or surfaces. Tam said that people with COVID-19 who have been asked to isolate but need to go to essential appointments could wear masks to prevent themselves from spreading the virus. And anyone exhibiting symptoms, even mild ones, could wear a mask for the same reasons. N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC)

Murals of Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam, left, and B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry were painted on boarded-up windows in Vancouver’s Gastown neighbourhood. (Maggie MacPherson/CBC) Canadian officials say isolation orders will be in place 'for a long time' Canadian officials warned that emergency and public health measures will likely be in place for some time to come — and with case numbers rising, several provinces have made moves to extend orders aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix on Tuesday told people in his province there is \"zero chance — none\ " that orders meant to tackle COVID-19 would be varied by the end of this month. \"I think we're in this for a long time,\ " he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to put a specific timeline on how long strict measures could last, saying they would be in place for a number of weeks — and perhaps months. Trudeau again reiterated a call on Canadians to respect public health rules and practise physical distancing, saying the behaviour of Canadians has a direct impact on how the health crisis will unfold. Today, Toronto provided details about a 12-week plan to try to clamp down on the virus's spread, after Mayor John Tory said COVID-19 \"numbers are presently heading in the wrong direction\" in Canada's largest city. Quebec, meanwhile, tightened up its rules around non-essential travel both within the province as well as into the western part of the province, with exclusions for essential workers. Read more about what's happening across Canada   Air pollution eases in 4 Canadian cities as pandemic measures keep people home Public health measures shutting down workplaces and schools to fight the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a noticeable reduction in air pollution in multiple Canadian cities known for their traffic congestion, according to satellite images shared with CBC News. Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver have seen drops in vehicle traffic over the last few days as physical distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have kept Canadians closer to home. Images from Descartes Labs of the major cities and surrounding areas show their average levels of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) — a pollutant created by the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline — has plummeted compared to a year ago. Nitrogen dioxide should not be confused with greenhouse gases — but because it and carbon dioxide are both produced when fossil fuels are burned, there is a relationship between levels of NO2 and carbon dioxide emissions. Read more about the reduction in air pollution The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise around the world — and here at home. That has many wondering whether public health officials should revisit their policies on people wearing face masks. But as we learn, there are many questions with not so many definitive answers. Where is the science on wearing masks? Where should you wear a mask? How should you wear it? What about supply? Jayme Poisson tries to tackle some of these questions with Dr. Isaac Bogoch, on tonight’s Front Burner. 13:04 Canadian suppliers won't have N95 masks ready for months, forcing the government to look abroad With no domestic production of crucial N95 masks for health-care workers on the COVID-19 front lines, Canada's federal government is bulk-buying tens of millions of them on the international market to meet short-term demand. The Trudeau government's announcement yesterday that it will spend up to $2 billion to procure personal protective equipment — including more than 60 million N95 masks — comes weeks into a global pandemic and raises questions about Canada's emergency preparedness. Only medical masks such as those labelled N95, sometimes called respirators, are designed and fitted to filter out the tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce only some aerosol particles. Earlier today, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam offered some guidance on the use of non-medical masks. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 Health-care workers around the country say they have been rationing the protective N95 masks while they wait for stocks to be replenished. Because there are currently no domestic manufacturers of N95 masks, pressure put on the global supply by the coronavirus pandemic has left Canada in a precarious position. Read more about the need for N95 masks   (CBC News) ANALYSIS Strategies for safe grocery shopping during a pandemic Public health officials across the country have been consistent in their advice that people stay home as much as possible and therefore try to shop for groceries only once a week or less, and preferably alone. But Canadians still have questions about how to best get groceries during a pandemic. Here are some insights from experts: If debating between shopping online or going in person to the grocery store, a simple message from Toronto's medical officer of health, Eileen de Villa, may help guide you: \"Each time we leave our homes, we increase the risk of virus spread.\ " But in some parts of the country right now, getting a delivery or even a pickup slot for online shopping is nearly impossible without a wait of a week or two. Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases specialist at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, suggests that people who are healthy and able can still go to the grocery store in person. And what should you do once you're at the store? Disinfect the shopping cart handle and do your best to keep two metres between you and other people, even if it means waiting to go down an aisle or to get what you need off the shelf. Wash or disinfect your hands after you pay for and pack up your groceries and before you put them in your car. Once you get home, \"put away the groceries, wash your hands,\ " Chagala says. And when you're preparing your food, he advises to wash your hands afterwards, just as you would normally before you eat. THE SCIENCE Canadian hospitals getting 'creative' to expand COVID-19 care facilities With many experts predicting a surge in COVID-19 cases here in the next couple of weeks, many Canadian hospitals are also looking for \"creative\" solutions as they scramble to prepare. Paul-Émile Cloutier, the CEO of the largest national organization of hospitals in Canada, said hospital administrators are looking at recreation centres, hotels and other facilities that may be vacant right now. As well, some have ordered \"makeshift\" hospitals and quarantine centres to be constructed. \"They do not want to be in the same position as Italy,\" he says. In the U.S., naval hospital ships have been pressed into service in New York and California. There's so far no word of the Canadian government pressing naval ships into COVID-19 service, but there is existing infrastructure in Canada that could be transformed into medical facilities to assist with the expected surge of cases. An off-site solution presents its own unique challenges. \"The rationale for keeping patients on-site is that with COVID-19, patients' conditions can change very quickly,\" said Dr. Ian Preyra, chief of staff of the new pandemic response unit in Burlington, Ont. \"We want them to be close to the hospital so that we can transfer them directly to intensive care if their conditions worsen.\" AND FINALLY... N.S. grocery store staff use mystery gift to buy groceries for seniors Staff members at an Atlantic Superstore in Antigonish, N.S., bought groceries for four seniors in the area after receiving $400 from an anonymous customer as a gift. (Mark Boudreau) Atlantic Superstore staff in Antigonish, N.S., decided to use an anonymous gift that was dropped off by a customer to buy groceries for four seniors who live in the area. A man dropped off 10 sealed envelopes covered with messages such as \"Thank you for working,\ " \"Thank you for all you're doing during COVID-19\" and \"Thank you from the community.\ " Each envelope contained $40 and the man wanted the envelopes to be distributed to the store's staff. Patti Hilton, the store's manager, said the staff decided to use the $400 to buy groceries for four seniors, and that they would be making the deliveries personally. \"Here's the thing, we are still working. We still get a paycheque every week and there are so many people out of work and so many seniors that need help right now that we decided to pay it forward,\ " Hilton said.

  Joe Carson is still his usual, chirpy self while bagging groceries, even if it seems more impersonal when it happens behind a glass shield. From his demeanour at the Family Foods in St. James, you wouldn't guess the risk he takes every day by being here. When he must pass between customers, Carson discreetly tilts his head and covers his mouth with his jacket. He doesn't make a scene of the ways the coronavirus looms over him. \"I come with a little bit of worry.  I have a sick parent at home,\" says the 25-year-old, a supervisor at the grocery store.

Their employees are vulnerable, at risk of exposure as they deal with packed stores and frustrated customers. They're called heroes for showing up. Around those employees, Winnipeg's grocery stores have changed to adapt to the new protocols. Store workers are wiping the handles of shopping carts. Many are wearing gloves; some are donning masks. There are Plexiglas screens at checkouts, where cashiers and customers were previously face-to-face.   Throughout the Family Foods in St. James, customers are reminded of the cleanliness precautions the store is taking to protect everyone during a global pandemic. (Ian Froese/CBC) When he's wearing gloves, Carson discards a pair every half hour. He will probably wash his hands raw by the time this pandemic is over.   \"We're sanitizing every time there's not a customer,\ " Carson said on Friday. He tries to wipe down the handheld debit machine or any other surface when he isn't punching the cash register. \"It's a learning curve right now, remembering all the tasks we have to do.\" The importance of rigorous disinfection duties was hammered home Friday, when the Real Canadian Superstore on Regent Avenue West was closed for a \"deep cleaning\" because one staff member is suspected of contracting the virus. A Superstore employee in Oshawa, Ont., died from the coronavirus last month. Regent Superstore closed due to worker testing positive for COVID-19 Most customers at Carson's store get the idea. They see posters instructing customers to keep their distance. Those who don't understand the need for physical distancing, or don't want to, are sticking out. \"Make sure you tell him that people are mean and yelling at us,\" pipes up one of Carson's colleagues, who didn't want her name used. Those people are in the minority, Carson insists. It doesn't dismiss the precautions of everybody else. \"The other thing that's really changed is the amount of people that have been gracious,\ " he says. \"Thank you for coming to work,\ " they're saying. Customers' support validating \"It means the world to us to hear that because we also want to be at home and self-isolating ... but we're here and when you do your part to help us, it really helps us. \"It really validates what we're doing.\"   At the Foodfare farther west along Portage Avenue, a hand sanitizer station is rolling through the front door.

  As social distancing separates people from their friends and family, Albertans are increasingly looking online for companionship and conversation. And scammers are taking advantage of the situation, warns a detective with the Edmonton Police Service. Fraudsters are opportunistic criminals and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it easier for criminals to extract money and personal information from their victims, Det. Linda Herczeg said Wednesday. Scammers, who often use sick family members as an excuse to plead for money, now have a new reason for never meeting their victims face-to-face. \"The coronavirus is not just necessarily the medical piece,\" said Herczeg. \"People are pulling that excuse into not meeting people. ' Honey, I love you but I can't meet you because I am self-isolating.' The believability of it becomes just a little more.\" $1.7 M lost to romance scams since Jan. 1 The increase in criminal activity is especially apparent in romance fraud, where con artists use internet dating sites to troll for victims, profess love, then use the relationship to dupe their mark out of money.   Since Jan. 1, Edmonton police have investigated 21 romance scams that have cost victims a total of $1.7 million, Herczeg said. That's about half of the total losses reported for romance scams in all of last year, she said. The increase in romance scams linked to coronavirus seems to be happening around the world. Herczeg said she is hearing similar anecdotes from police colleagues working internationally. Scammers often call and message their victims dozens of times each day, and lonely people are especially vulnerable, she said.   \"You feel a part of something and you feel somebody cares,\ " she said. \"And that's why people fall victim to those types of scams.\ " Other scams related to the pandemic include online sales of sought-after items like hand-sanitizer and face masks, Herczeg said. \"They're going door to door, they're selling self-test kits. We have people who are buying up sanitizers and whatever they can get their hands on and then they're reselling it on online websites,\ " she said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. Don't fall for free face masks \"There's the free masks that you can get — they're sending through text or they're sending them through email with hyperlinks. Of course, the hyperlinks typically have malware behind them or they're phishing for your personal information so they can get into your banking.\" One Edmontonian who reported such a scam lost about $240 trying to buy face masks from a fraudulent site, Herczeg said. She stressed that if you are ever in doubt about a phone call or digital message, disconnect and seek verification. If you believe you have been scammed, report it to police.   Many people believe that scams are coming from overseas and don't bother reporting attempts to police but Herzceg said that's not the case.   \"A lot of people dismiss them because they think they're overseas and there's nothing that the police can do about it, but a lot of them are domestic.\" Tech issues temporarily halt applications for Alberta COVID-19 emergency isolation funding'We did it right:' COVID-19 scare at oilsands work camp tests businesses' plans
  Canadian hospitals are gearing up their disaster preparedness plans in anticipation of the next phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, from containment to mitigation.   Current efforts to control the epidemic focus on keeping community spread at bay. If it's declared a pandemic, that will shift to slowing down the spread of the virus in populations where it's taken root. In a pandemic, large numbers of people fall sick, though the disease may or may not be severe. The World Health Organization is calling on governments, health care and other institutions as well as individuals to prepare. \"We're at a decisive point,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Thursday. \"For the past two days, the number of new cases reported in the rest of the world has exceeded the number of new cases reported from China.\" Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in Toronto, is a veteran of SARS and H1N1 and is watching this outbreak closely.

(Luis Echeverria/Reuters) \"The tone has changed,\ " Gardam said. \"We need to shift our thinking into  this is going to become a problem within Canada within a matter of weeks to months.\ " Currently, health care workers in Canada screen people who show up with flu-like symptoms and say they've travelled to any of seven places  — China, Japan, Hong Kong, Italy, Iran, Singapore and South Korea. \"At some point we'll have to shift into just screening people that are travelling, and it doesn't necessarily matter to where they're actually travelling from,\ " Gardam said. WHO said China's experience shows aggressive early measures can prevent the virus from gaining a foothold, and there hasn't been widespread community transmission  — the spread from one person to another when there was no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with an infected individual. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a case of COVID-19 in California suspected of being the first person-to-person transmission in the general public in that country, which has alarmed U.S. health officials because it raises the possibility of widespread transmission, already suspected in Italy, Germany and South Korea. WATCH:   Infectious disease doctor explains what's happening with global spread of COVID-19 Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch looks at the implications of COVID-19's global reach and asymptomatic transmission of the disease. 2:18 \"This suggests the virus is out there in the community,\" said Dr. Dean Blumberg of University of California Davis Medical Center. \"We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we could get it from. \"There's probably other cases in the community that we don't know about.\" Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, said the province is preparing for the possibility of community transmission. \"Right now, we're doing 30 to 40 tests,\ " Williams said. \"Our lab can do 1,000. But we can't rest on that. What if we have to go to 2,000 or 3,000? How do we prepare for that?\ " Gardam said it is time to expand testing. \"I think at this stage, we should be testing people without a travel history who are sick enough to be admitted and who do not have another obvious cause of their illness.  This is what they eventually did in California that allowed them to find their case.\" Medical facilities also have to take stock of their facilities, equipment and supplies to see where they are lacking: masks, gloves and gowns for health care workers; testing supplies; the ability to isolate patients.   Federal pandemic stockpiles include medical equipment and supplies, such as ventilators and masks, as well as standard medications like antibiotics and antivirals, the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement to CBC News.   Bracing for resource strain    Dr. Anand Kumar teaches medical microbiology at the University of Manitoba and works as a critical care physician in Winnipeg, where he sounded an alarm about lack of ventilators to care for patients during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Kumar expects the risk in terms of severity of illness in the potential COVID-19 pandemic will be similar to H1N1. In 2009, many places found a major \"choke point\" was a lack of resources in intensive care units, including nurses.   \"The pressures on the health care system in terms of resources are likely to be similar,\" Kumar said.   Dr. Anand Kumar, an ICU attending physician, poses for a photograph in an intensive care ward at the St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg in August 2009 during the H1N1 flu pandemic. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) Although H1N1 and Ebola offered head starts in developing contingency plans, most hospitals already operate at full capacity, particularly during flu season.   Gardam said if an epidemic were to go on for several months, hospitals would have to start looking at how to free up beds by putting people in \"unusual places\" and stopping elective procedures.   Hospital preparations should also include additional training: having staff practise putting on and taking off preventative equipment safely, said Nancy Johnson, a retired occupational health and safety specialist with the Ontario Nurses' Association in Sudbury. \"Safety of health care workers right now is not negotiable,\" Johnson said. \"If they're not safe, none of us are.\ " Masks and gloves in short supply Some family physicians have already found supplies running short, including masks to put on sick patients.   I \"check the mail every day for N95 masks, which have yet to arrive,\" said Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician in Toronto. \"[And] more gloves, hopefully. We don't have them or hand sanitizer.\ " Health Minister Patty Hadju encouraged Canadians to prepare as they would for a storm. You could eventually be exposed to COVID-19, but panic can be scarier than the virus, say expertsPublic health officials taking stock of supplies, equipment to prepare for possible coronavirus pandemic \"First of all, making sure that you do have enough supplies so if someone in your family becomes ill, if you yourself become ill, that you have what you need to survive for a week or so without going outside,\ " Hadju said. To help, individuals can do their best to stay healthy and keep up to date as the epidemic evolves. The standard prevention measures include washing hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, getting a flu shot, staying home when sick and coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow.   
  Dr. Michael Warner is preparing for battle. He's head of the intensive care unit at the Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, and he knows that any day he's about to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. \"It's ominous. There's an air of foreboding,\" he said. \"This is coming. There are already ICUs in the Greater Toronto Area with patients with COVID-19.\ " It's also a battle he knows he can't fight without the necessary equipment. \"This is like D-Day. I'm on the boats and I don't know where the guns are,\ " he said. \"You don't know what the enemy looks like, and you don't know how long the battle will last. \"And you don't know if you have enough artillery and armour to protect you for the full battle.\" Dr. Michael Warner, head of the intensive care unit at the Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, has been trying to round up as many supplies as possible for his hospital. (Michael Garron Hospital                                                      ) One of the most critical pieces of armour is a simple disposable mask with a stamp that reads: N95. He knows there won't be enough of them. Having that mask could be the difference between life and death for a patient, because doctors and nurses need to protect themselves from viral contamination before they can insert a breathing tube. \"I don't want to be in the position where I'm saying, 'Sorry, I can't help your father, mother, child because I don't have the personal protective equipment,'\" he said. \"That's a personal nightmare for me.\ " 'People want to do something' Who else uses these special disposable masks? Carpenters. Construction workers. So Warner started contacting people he knows in those industries asking for help. He said if they have any N95s, let him know, because he needs them for the hospital. He didn't stop there. He also knows there won't be enough ventilators — mechanical breathing machines that can keep critically ill COVID-19 patients alive long enough for their lungs to recover. Who else has ventilators? Cosmetic surgeons. Soon, Warner had prominent plastic surgeons organizing their network to start rounding up ventilators. Veterinarians who treat large animals also use ventilators in their emergency rooms. So Warner sent some more emails. Would animal ventilators work on humans? \"I don't know enough about animal ventilators to know, but I think at this point everything is on the table,\ " Warner said. Everyone got back to him immediately, pledging to do what they can to help. \"People want to do something, if there is something they can do,\" he said. \"They just want to be told, and they'll do it.\ " Lesley MacNeil, an assistant professor of biochemistry at McMaster University in Hamilton, gathered up supplies for the local hospital. (Lesley MacNeil) Warner said it was the best use of his remaining time before the surge of sick patients begins. \"I can't wait for a shipment of N95 masks that might never come from the government.\" Running out of time Federal and provincial governments have announced measures over the past few days to increase the supply of hospital equipment, including masks. An interim order passed by the federal health minister on Wednesday will make it easier to import COVID-19 test kits. But already the strains on supplies are starting to appear. Some regions are running low on nasal swabs used to test patients for COVID-19. And Canada is competing to buy masks with the U.S. and countries all over the world that are grappling with the global shortage. Some Toronto hospitals could run out of some supplies within two weeks — and that's based on usage rates over the last month, not counting an increase in consumption rates expected as COVID-19 patients begin flooding hospitals. That's why Warner is asking business leaders, manufacturers and innovators to come with rapid private sector solutions. \"We are going to need these supplies very soon,\ " he said. Warner said he knows governments are scrambling to increase supplies, but he's not sure they understand how critical a simple mask can be. \"I think they recognize that [personal protective equipment] is important. I don't know if they understand how quickly we could burn through it, and the catastrophic nature of that problem,\ " he said. \"We can have all the ventilators in the world, but they will sit idle if you can't intubate a patient to put on that machine.\" Michael Hendricks of McGill University is contributing supplies from his lab to help health-care providers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. (Sarah Moser) While Warner was reaching out to construction workers and veterinarians, Michael Hendricks was rummaging around the supply cupboards in his McGill University lab searching for N95 masks, boxes of latex gloves, and chemicals he uses to study the nervous systems of nematode worms. Hendricks and researchers across Canada have received urgent emails from both provincial and federal health agencies asking them to donate testing chemicals, called reagents, and other laboratory supplies for COVID-19 testing. With the supplies on back order, provinces are forced to ration their COVID-19 tests. But many research labs that study biological science would have the necessary reagents. \"These are reagents that are involved in isolating RNA from samples,\ " Hendricks said.  \"And reagents are used for the amplification tests to see if the virus is there.\ " Hendricks piled up whatever he had for pickup. \"We had some N95 masks and about 100 regular surgical procedure masks. We have a ton of gloves — pick a size. We had recently ordered a bunch of boxes of gloves. We had thousands. We sent some of the RNA isolation kit materials as well.\" Research labs across the country are being scoured for supplies that are desperately needed in hospitals.   (Michael Hendricks) Hendricks was happy to be contributing to the fight against COVID-19. He said the university research labs are quiet. All of the students have been told to go home. All of the research has been put on hold. The Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services is organizing the collection at McGill, while at McMaster University, supplies are being collected for the local Hamilton Health Sciences hospital. Lesley MacNeil, an assistant professor of biochemistry at McMaster, was among the researchers gathering supplies. Even though she doesn't study viruses specifically, she was still able to contribute some personal protective equipment including gloves, face shields and eye goggles. \"Right now, the labs are shutting down. So we just gave them everything we had,\ " she said. How Ontario hospitals are preparing for a surge in COVID-19 casesAnalysisThis pandemic is redefining what qualifies as a political 'crisis' At Humber River Hospital in Toronto, Dr. Michael Gardam said preparing for COVID-19 is taking up all of his time as chief of staff and infectious diseases consultant. When he heard of Warner's scramble to find masks and ventilators, Gardam agreed the situation calls for such desperate measures. \"If the models are true , then yes, we need everything we can get.\"

Experts criticize Ottawa for destroying millions of N95 masks. Bank of Canada holds rate at 0.25%; home sales fell 14% in March, CREA says. INTERACTIVE |  Tracking the spread of coronavirus in Canada.   More than 1,000 deaths in Canada have been linked to the COVID-19 global pandemic, according to a CBC News tally of deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus.    The spread of the contagious respiratory illness has strained health systems, caused deadly outbreaks at long-term care homes and sparked strict public health measures aimed at slowing its spread. The list, based on publicly available data from provinces and local health units, and CBC's own reporting, put the toll at 1,054 at 1:15 p.m. ET Wednesday.  Cases were first reported in Canada in late January.    Cause for cautious optimism in Canada's COVID-19 fight, top doctor says  Even with the higher toll, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said on Wednesday that there is evidence the spread is slowing. Tam noted the number of cases in the country is now doubling every 10 days or so, compared to every three days in late March. But she warned it was too soon to ease physical distancing measures. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at his media briefing that it will be \"weeks more\" before the government can seriously consider loosening public health restrictions, saying lifting rules too quickly could result in more cases and losing the progress Canada has made in the fight so far. There are more than two million recorded coronavirus cases worldwide, according to a database maintained by Johns Hopkins University, with more than 128,000 deaths attributed to the coronavirus around the world. Canada has more than 28,300 presumptive and confirmed cases. Trudeau on Wednesday announced the government is expanding the list of people who are eligible to receive the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) established to help those who are out of work because of the pandemic and the measures put in place to fight it. The prime minister also said the federal government will work with provinces and territories to boost the pay of essential workers making less than $2,500 a month, citing staff at long-term care homes as an example. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Wednesday that the issue of boosting the salary for lower-paid essential workers will be discussed on an upcoming call with premiers, with the hope of finding a resolution quickly.   Easing of rules will vary 'from region to region' Trudeau again emphasized his message of staying home as much as possible and ensuring that public health measures aren't lifted too soon. He said a \"one size fits all\" approach won't work for a country as diverse as Canada, but said no matter the region, it's key to get through the first wave of COVID-19 before starting to lift some of the rules. \"How that release works will vary from region to region, from industry to industry,\" he said. \"Co-ordination at the federal level and how we do that is going to be very important.\" A resident cries as she speaks to her son on the sidewalk at the Residence Floralies in the Montreal borough of LaSalle on Wednesday. At least a dozen residents have died of COVID-19 in the last three weeks. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Trudeau said he knows people want to get outside and understands the struggles people are facing, but added it will be \"weeks more\" before government can consider loosening restrictions. \"It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we're suddenly back in another big wave of COVID-19,\ " he said, calling for an extremely careful approach to relaxing restrictions. \"It's not happening yet,\ " the prime minister said. \"If we reopen too soon, everything we're doing now might be for nothing.\" Canada-U.S. border discussion At a news briefing Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked about relaxing restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border. The two countries have kept the border closed to all non-essential traffic since March 20.   \"Our relationship with Canada is very good. We'll talk about that,\ " Trump said. \"It will be one of the early borders to be released. Canada is doing well. We're doing well. We'll see.\" Reduced services at some border crossings Late Tuesday, the Canada Border Services Agency announced it is reducing service hours at 27 lower-traffic land border crossings on a temporary basis, saying the COVID-19-related measures will begin at 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

(Christine Muschi/Reuters) The CBSA said in a statement that the measures, which affect crossings in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Quebec, will remain in effect until further notice.   The government announced in mid-March that it was closing the border to most non-citizens — but that initial announcement had several exceptions, including for Americans. Days later, Canada and the U.S. announced a temporary closure to all non-essential traffic in a push to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The government said it will begin to routinely test care workers and will also test any residents who show symptoms. Currently, only the first five symptomatic residents of a home are tested to determine whether there is an outbreak. British officials are also under fire for failing to conduct more tests for COVID-19.

  Premier Stephen McNeil has rolled out an emergency plan to deal with cases of COVID-19 at the Northwood long-term care facility in Halifax. On Sunday, two more residents from the Northwood Halifax Campus died. Five residents have died at Northwood during the outbreak. The total death toll for COVID-19 in Nova Scotia as of Sunday is nine. At a briefing Sunday, Premier Stephen McNeil said an emergency plan has been implemented at Northwood that involves having residents who have recovered from COVID-19 moving to a hotel. McNeil said Shannex has donated equipment to support residents, including electric beds, tables and other supplies for the off-site care unit at the hotel. \"The first resident was transferred earlier today by ambulance and I'm told that the family was there to wave as their mom moved in,\ " McNeil said. \"A number of residents followed and that will continue throughout the week as residents continue to recover.\ "  McNeil said the Halifax Infirmary's COVID-19 team will be redeployed to Northwood to support its emergency response starting Sunday night. That team includes 40 workers, including nurses, continuing-care workers and rehab therapists. Although Northwood is advertising for employees, the premier said the province does not plan to take advantage of an offer from Ottawa to participate in a program to top up wages for some low-earning essential workers. \"I want to thank all health-care workers and everyone volunteering to support Northwood during this critical time,\ " McNeil said. Northwood will talk more about its plan to fight COVID-19 at its Halifax campus at a press conference on Monday. According to Unifor, the union that represents workers at Northwood, the site is moving about 20 residents to a hotel.   Linda MacNeil, Atlantic regional director for Unifor, said the move gives the facility the chance to do further cleaning and also helps resolve some staffing issues the site is facing. Double rooms turned into single rooms Some double rooms will be changed to singles, which should also help efforts to contain spread of the disease, MacNeil said in telephone interview.   On Saturday, MacNeil said her union has been asked by the province to find more workers to help at Northwood.   Unifor, along with CUPE, the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union and Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union have put out calls for volunteers to work at Northwood as part of a good neighbours agreement the unions have with the provincial government. Unions say anyone going into the site will be provided with necessary personal protective equipment. MacNeil said it's been an overwhelming time for staff at Northwood. \"You're trying to do the best you can with what you have and you care for your residents. So it's extremely stressful,\ " she said. \"I bow to them because without them, where would those residents be? It's very stressful, but they know this is for the residents and they care deeply for them. Essentially, when you work in those facilities, they're like family. So you want to treat them as such.\" Cases in long-term care homes approach 150 Two other people who died were residents at other long-term care facilities. As of Saturday, the province said there were eight long-term care homes in Nova Scotia with cases of COVID-19, including 93 residents and 54 staff. Cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia rose to 675 on Sunday with 26 new positive test results. The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 856 Nova Scotia tests on Saturday. There have been 21,120 negative test results so far. There are eleven people in hospital, with four people in the intensive care unit. The province lists 200 people as recovered. McNeil said there are cases of COVID-19 in all Nova Scotia communities. \"We started this journey as a province together and we're going to end it together, and we will take the measures off the province consistently when we believe public health gives us this ability that we can protect Nova Scotians,\ " he said. \"If there's anyone out there who believes this virus is not in their particular community they're fooling themselves.\" Dr. Strang takes on Dr. Oz Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer, said the province is working on a number of therapeutic options when it comes to treating patients with COVID-19. When asked about the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, Strang said there is \"a whole lot of mythology\" around the drug. \"Do not believe everything you read just because of the internet and, certainly, do not believe Dr. Oz,\" Strang said, referencing the American television doctor who has endorsed the drug as a possible treatment to COVID-19. Strang said studies around hydroxychloroquine \"are not robust at all.\ " He said any medication purported to be a treatment for COVID-19 should only be used in rigorous clinical trials.

 Nurses and orderlies in the Laurentians are bracing for a surge in COVID-19 cases, and say their employer, the CISSS des Laurentides, is not giving them the protective equipment they need. The union representing orderlies is taking matters into its own hands, shelling out nearly $25,000 of its own money to buy face shields for any worker who wants one. \"From the moment the employer doesn't want to supply them, as a union we have the responsibility that our workers — who are paying dues — are well-protected,\" said Steve Bouchard, vice-president of the syndicat des travailleuses et des travailleurs des Laurentides en santé et services sociaux-CSN. The union, which also represents kitchen staff, cleaners and other support workers, ordered the 3,000 face shields from Groupe Neurones in Quebec City. The visors are emblazoned with the union's logo and will replace safety glasses provided by the CISSS, which Bouchard says generate too much fog. The concerns over protective gear come as the number of seniors' residences and long-term care facilities in the Laurentians with at least one COVID-19 case doubled in 24 hours, from five on Tuesday, to 10 on Wednesday, according to government statistics. The unions are hoping to avoid a scenario akin to what's happened in Montreal-area nursing homes, where large swaths of patients and staff have been infected with COVID-19, and hundreds of seniors have died. The new visors will start arriving this week and be “donated” to the CISSS des Laurentides ( syndicat des travailleuses et des travailleurs des Laurentides en santé et services sociaux-CSN) Bouchard says it took more than two days of haggling before getting the green light to use the face shields, which are expected to arrive this week. The union can't distribute them directly to their members — the masks will be \"donated\" to the CISSS, which will then give them to union members. \"It's the whole bureaucracy of the ministry and the CISSS des Laurentides,\" he said. \"With the mergers it's become so huge that no one wants to make the decision — or is capable of making the decision.\" The regional health agency's deputy director general, Jean-Philippe Cottin, said it was a question of safety. \"We're open to donations so long as they respect public safety standards for protection,\ " he said. N95 masks too tightly rationed, nurses say On a similar note, the local nurses' union, the Syndicat des professionnels en soins des Laurentides-FIQ, says the CISSS is failing to supply and maintain uniforms for its members, despite an agreement with the province that requires it. Denis Provencher, the union's interim president, said he is worried that by having to launder their own scrubs, nurses could contaminate their families and their patients. The union is also decrying similar inflexibility when it comes to masks, which it says are kept \"under lock and key.\ " Provencher says in some facilities, the distribution of N95 masks is being tightly rationed by managers, to the point where nurses have given up asking for extras when they need them. \"It's not left up to the health-care professional's good judgment,\ " he said. \"They have to make a request before they get them and it's a long, arduous process.\ " Cottin acknowledges the health authority is \"very vigilant\" in minding the stock of protective equipment, but said there is no widespread scarcity in the region. Denis Provencher, interim head of the local Laurentians nurses' union, says masks are kept “under lock and key. ”   (Vincent Rességuier/Radio-Canada) In recent days, the Legault government has maintained there is no shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the province.

A new month means a fresh set of bills for Canadian families and businesses struggling with the health and financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, as officials warn that the emergency and public health measures will likely be in place for some time to come. With case numbers rising, several provinces have made moves to extend orders aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in China and has since spread around the world.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday declined to put a specific timeline on how long strict measures could last, saying they would be in place for a number of weeks — and perhaps months. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Trudeau again reiterated a call on Canadians to respect public health rules and practice physical distancing, saying the behaviour of Canadians has a direct impact on how the health crisis will unfold.

On Wednesday, Toronto Mayor John Tory said COVID-19 \"numbers are presently heading in the wrong direction\" in Canada's largest city. Tory spoke as the city provided details about a 12-week plan to try and clamp down on the virus's spread.

Emergency benefit site launching The Trudeau government has announced several programs meant to support families and businesses struggling to pay bills, but there is no firm timeline for when money will start flowing for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or the business support programs. Trudeau said Wednesday that those eligible will be able to apply through an online portal for the CERB beginning April 6, and that people who have already applied for Employment Insurance don't need to apply. Trudeau says starting April 6 you can apply online for the CERB - that's the $2000/month for anyone making 0 income. Direct deposits will be made within 3-5 days, or within 10 days by mail. Applicants will have to confirm once a month that they are out of work.&mdash;@iamSas \"These are the biggest economic measures in our lifetime, to defeat a threat to our health,\" said Trudeau, noting that the government alone can't win the fight. \"We — each of us — have to live up to our end of the bargain. We must fulfil our collective responsibility to each other.\" On Wednesday afternoon, Finance Minister Bill Morneau provided further details around the wage subsidy program. The program will be available to both small and large businesses who have lost significant revenue due to COVID-19, and will cost about $71 billion. Morneau has encouraged businesses to rehire employees they may have laid off in the wake of the outbreak, saying the wage subsidy will be available in six weeks.

He also said Ottawa should work with provinces to move toward a pause on rent. When asked about April 1 rent payments, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government is looking at this, as well as discussing the issue with the provinces. She did not provide specifics. \"This is a really big economic challenge and it is a huge health challenge,\ " she said, adding that the federal government structured its work to begin with the life-and-death health issues before moving on to programs meant to help individual Canadians \"weather this economic storm.\" Health-system capacity concerns As of 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, officials in Canada had reported more than 9,700 confirmed and presumptive cases, with 129 deaths. The provinces and territories that are providing details on recovered cases have listed a total of 1,739 as recovered.   There have also been two COVID-19 linked deaths of Canadians outside Canada — one in Japan and one in Brazil. Public health officials have cautioned that reported numbers don't capture the full picture, as there are potential cases that haven't been identified or tested, as well as cases where investigations are ongoing or lab results are not yet in. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Wednesday that there's a real need to expand the health-care system and workforce to handle an expected increase in cases.  She said public health has to work hard to \"suppress this initial curve\" so that the health system doesn't become overwhelmed.

Provincially run health systems have been working to ready themselves for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients, but supply of that critical gear is a growing concern. On Wednesday evening, the Ontario Hospital Association said it is \"extremely concerned\" about the shortage of personal protective equipment, particularly masks. \"Ontario hospitals are now at a critical juncture,\ " Anthony Dale, president and CEO of the OHA, said in a statement. He called on Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and their governments \"to work unceasingly to ensure that new supply is provided immediately\" to Ontario hospitals, long-term care facilities and other health-care providers.   In Quebec, Premier François Legault cautioned that supplies were getting tight — with only three to seven days worth of supplies for some equipment. Ontario had sent some gear to assist Quebec in tackling its growing caseload, Legault said. \"We're using 10 times more medical equipment as normal,\" said Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann . \"So what we used in one year, we're using in four weeks.\ "  Wear masks if you want — but keep up the handwashing and physical distancing, say Tam and Hajdu  WATCH | Dr. Theresa Tam addresses whether Canadians should be wearing non-medical masks: Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 Trudeau reiterated Wednesday that the federal government is working closely with provinces to try and meet needs, as well as working internationally to try and get equipment into Canada.  The prime minister didn't offer a specific timeline, saying only that deliveries are expected in the next few days, or perhaps sooner.   Hajdu said Canada has the money and workforce required to get the protective gear and said the country will fight for its share as it becomes available in a competitive market.

France on Wednesday is evacuating 36 patients infected with the coronavirus from the Paris region on board two medicalized high-speed TGV trains. The patients, all treated in intensive-care units, are being transferred to several hospitals in Brittany, as western France is less impacted by the epidemic. The country has already operated several transports of patients by train, helicopter, military aircraft and aboard a navy ship. Some patients from eastern France have also been transferred to hospitals in neighbouring Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland. France has increased its capacity of 5,000 ICU beds before the crisis to 8,000 now and is aiming at getting 14,000 ICU beds in the coming weeks, according to health authorities. Russia completely shut its borders this week and sharply limited the number of flights taking Russians home, leaving thousands stranded abroad. Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said the number of Russians allowed to return will be limited to 700 a day, including 500 in Moscow, due to a limited capacity to properly screen and isolate those arriving. Russia has registered 2,777 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths. Here's a look at what's happening in China, South Korea, Iran and other areas From The Associated Press, updated at 8:00 p.m. ET: China's National Health Commission on Wednesday reported 36 new COVID-19 cases, one day after announcing that asymptomatic cases will now be included in the official count. The commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad, while seven more deaths from the disease had been reported over the previous 24 hours. The commission did not say if any of the new cases were asymptomatic, but on Tuesday reported that, of a total of 1,541 asymptomatic cases now being isolated and monitored for symptoms, 205 had come from overseas. The move to disclose the number of asymptomatic cases comes amid scrutiny of China's reported figures, which previously only included people who exhibited symptoms. While the proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, scientists say these \"carriers\" can still pass COVID-19 on to others who do end up getting sick. Residents wearing face masks pay for groceries Wednesday by standing on chairs to peer over barriers set up around a wet market on a street in Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicentre of China's coronavirus disease outbreak.   (Aly Song/Reuters) As China's domestic outbreak has largely abated, some questioned whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections. China, where the virus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease. A senior official in Serbia's government died from the coronavirus on Wednesday, a health official said. Branislav Blazic, 63, was a state secretary with the Ministry for Environmental Protection, and died only days after being hospitalized with symptoms. Serbia has so far reported 1,060 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 28 deaths, in a total population of 7 million. To curb transmission of the virus, Serbian authorities have declared a state of emergency, shut down all restaurants and cafés, imposed a curfew from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and closed the country's borders. South Korean health officials say 43 patients have been placed under isolation in one of the biggest hospitals in the capital of Seoul after a hospitalized nine-year-old girl tested positive for the coronavirus. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday said around 50 medical staff who worked at the Asan Medical Center's pediatric department will be quarantined at their homes despite having tested negative. Jeong and Seoul city officials said the girl was tested for the virus after doctors found she had previously been treated for a headache at another hospital in Euijeongbu, near Seoul, where a dozen patients and medical staff have been infected with COVID-19. Officials didn't release specific details about the girl's condition.

Hundreds of patients and medical staff have been infected in hospitals in the worst-hit city of Daegu, where more than 6,700 of the country's 9,887 infections have been reported. The Middle East has over 75,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of those in Iran, and over 3,400 deaths. Iran's health ministry spokesperson, Kianoush Jahanpour, said Wednesday that the virus had killed another 138 people, pushing the country's death toll to 3,036 amid 47,593 confirmed cases. Japan has been pushed \"to the brink,\" in its battle against the novel coronavirus, a senior minister said. The country is barring entry to foreigners from 73 countries while the supply of medical services has begun to tighten in some areas. Japan has not yet declared a state of emergency, though infectious disease experts advising the government said that if measures in place now fail to halt secondary and re-infections from overseas, a Plan B would be needed. \"What we can do is to lock down cities or zones, which means more stringent, more harsh control on movement,\" Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura said.

The Indian government has been criticized for not adequately planning ahead for how it will support the large population of poor and homeless who have lost any means of earning income as a result of the pandemic. India is currently under a three-week lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has deprived an estimated four-million homeless people from earning a living and forced many others to seek refuge in overcrowded shelters.

  During the first two months of the year, the IWK Health Centre's emergency department was swamped. It had a record number of visits, and even installed extra seating to accommodate all the patients. Now, the doctors and nurses say it's shockingly quiet. Over the last few weeks, the pediatric emergency department saw the number of visits drop by more than half. \"It's dramatic,\ " said Dr. Katrina Hurley, chief of the emergency department. Colds, flus gone She said part of the decrease is because schools and daycares are closed. Typical cases of colds and flus are gone. \"With the physical distancing, we are just not seeing those types of illnesses anymore,\" she said. \"That, basically, abruptly ended flu season.\ " While the end of flu season is welcomed, there's growing concern among staff in the department that families might be staying away from the hospital because of COVID-19 fears. \"I would say people are nervous when they make the decision to come, it feels like a big decision,\" said Hurley. Some people tell her they haven't left home in two or three weeks. The IWK has split the emergency department into two areas with different entrances to separate any possible COVID-19 patients from those who are not infected.   (Brian MacKay/CBC) The hospital is hoping to ease concerns by talking about changes it has implemented to protect families. The emergency department now occupies two different parts of the IWK. Patients are screened at the door. Those showing possible virus symptoms are sent to one area, while patients with no symptoms go to another with a separate entrance. There are strict visitor restrictions, which mean just one parent or guardian can accompany a child.   That extra seating the hospital installed is now gone, and the remaining seating has been spaced further apart. Waiting room barely needed But with the new setup, there's rarely a need to use the waiting room. Patients are taken into rooms as quickly as possible. Rebecca deChamplain, clinical leader of operations in the emergency department, said all common areas are closed. \"I would suspect that families aren't in any contact with other children or families while they're here,\ " she said. \"It's pretty unlikely right now that you're even going to pass someone in a hallway.\" Staff wear protective gear, including masks, when meeting with patients. It's something that initially worried Hurley, who wondered how the children would react. She said she's surprised at how well they've adapted in just a few weeks. \"Kids are seeing their parents wear masks now, so I feel like wearing a mask now seems far more normal to people,\ " Hurley said. \"It's hard sometimes to interact with children when you're wearing a mask,\" deChamplain added. \"So we're all trying our best to have a friendly face as much as possible.\" Call 811 for advice DeChamplain said the IWK hopes parents trust their gut. If they would have brought a child to the department for something before the pandemic, they should continue to do so now, she said. \"We still want to see those children. We don't want parents to be trying to manage things that they don't feel comfortable managing at home.\ " If parents are on the fence, they can call 811. The number gives access to medical advice, even for those who don't suspect they have COVID-19. As patient numbers continue to stay low, Hurley said she now has spare time during her shifts, something that is new for her. She said the time is being well used to practise scenarios, such as if a child with COVID-19 needed to be resuscitated. \"It involves doing all those skills in a different setting than we would normally use, with different equipment that we would normally have available to us, and fewer people than we would normally use all to minimize the number of people who would be exposed,\" Hurley said.

  As COVID-19 spreads in Canada, the advice from medical professionals on how to stay safe has evolved.   At first, Canadians were told to wash their hands and avoid large groups. Within weeks, they were locked down in states of emergency and told to keep their distance from anyone not in the same household.   The federal message about masks has also changed. They're now considered reasonable in public settings such as public transit and grocery stores, where physical distancing can be hard to maintain. But health officials urge people to wear non-medical masks, such as bandanas, scarves and home-made masks, and to  save the medical supply of surgical masks and N95 masks for health-care workers. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now. Here are your top questions answered by chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell.   4:39 In New Brunswick, the advice has shifted too.   The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, initially said that only health-care workers needed to wear masks. Now she is now matching federal advice and suggests masks may be a handy tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19. N95 masks should be used by healthcare workers only. They come in different sizes to make sure the barrier is tight.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) \"We are suggesting that if you are going to wear a face covering that it be the homemade kind,\ " Russell said. The masks aren't for your protection, explained Russell, but for the protection of others, and to make sure your droplets aren't getting on other people. \"This does not replace hand hygiene and it doesn't replace social distancing,\ " she said. Mask-wearing should not replace hand-washing, says Russell. You should also wash your hands before donning your home-made mask and after removing it. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Russell said mask-wearing can help combat community spread of COVID-19. \"We do understand that there is a risk of transmission in those settings,\ " she said. \"We don't believe that it's the driving force of the transmission, but we know we can play a part and this is just one of those precautionary pieces of advice that we're giving people.\" \"Arming people with knowledge, arming people with information so they can take good proper steps to protect themselves and others … is really important.\ " When should you wear a mask?   Russell suggests wearing a mask in public, especially in places where you can't properly maintain two metres of distance between yourself and others.   \"Running errands, grocery shopping,\" she said.   If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate, call 811 or your doctor, and generally refrain from going out in public. But if you have a slight cough, or seasonal allergies, a mask might help protect the spread of any germs or droplets.   \"If you're wearing a facial covering it means that if you do cough, not only do you have the protection of your elbow but it's going to be trapped in the fabric somewhat,\ " she said. What about at work? As to whether you can and should wear a face covering at work, Russel said \"that would be something that you'd have to work out with with your employer.\ "  If you can't maintain two metres of distance while at work, a face-mask might be a good tool to use. But, Russell added, employers should also ensure social distancing i the workplace is happening, too. What's the difference between medical and home-made masks?   N95 masks and surgical masks are used by health-care workers who are on the front lines in hospitals around the world.   N95 masks come in different sizes so as to provide the best barrier against germs. They sometimes come with a filter on the front, and are purpose-built to solely protect the user from small particles. If you have a supply of surgical masks like these, Russell says there's nothing stopping you from using them, but she hopes people will consider donating them to the province.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) Surgical masks are also used in lower-risk health-care settings. They are typically made with three layers of fabric to filter any germs or larger respiratory particles, and they are disposable. N95 masks are in high demand around the world, said Russell, so it's important to leave them for healthcare workers.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) These are not the masks the public should be buying or wearing though, said Russell. N95 masks are in high demand, and stockpiles in hospitals around the world are getting low, which is why it's so important to save these masks for nurses and doctors.   Russell said even if you have a pre-existing medical condition, don't buy a medical mask. Distancing, isolation, and hand-washing measures are the best way to keep yourself safe.   \"People who are wearing the homemade facial coverings, they are doing their part in terms of protecting those people who are at higher risk,\" she said. Where can you get one?   Russell said non-medical masks can be made at home, and she pointed to resources from the Centers for Disease Control. Some people have even shared mask-making patterns on Pinterest, said Russell. \"Whatever pattern you choose, however you decide to make it, whether it's a sewn one or one that's not sewn, there have to be no gaps around your face. So when it is fitted onto your face there can't be any big gaps,\ " she said. Some sewers suggest using quilting fabric or fabric in a double-layer to make the masks, but you can even use an old T-shirt, according to the CDC. Masks made at home should be large enough to cover your mouth and nose, and should have no gaps on the sides.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) The mask should also be comfortable, said Russell, otherwise you won't want to wear it. It should also be large enough to cover both your nose and mouth.   If you currently have a stock of surgical masks, Russell said there's nothing stopping you from using them, but would rather see people donate them to the province's stockpile.   More information around how exactly to donate to that stockpile will be coming out very soon, said Russell.    How do you use it?   The mask should fit comfortably on your face and around your ears and should have no visible gaps. \"Wash your hands when you put it on, and wash your hands when you take it off,\ " said Russell. Masks like this one can be worn in public places where maintaining two metres of distance is difficult, like on public transit or in a grocery store.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) It's also important to wash the mask every day, or else germs will just stay on the fabric.   \"I would not want people to just wear these facial coverings without making sure that they're doing proper hand hygiene and actually washing the material that the mask is made of,\" she said. As for how to clean the masks, hot, soapy water should do the trick, but other cleaning advice is available online.   \"If you washed it in hot soapy water at a good high temperature that would suffice,\ " Russell said. \"But there could be other cleaning advice as well that you would find resources for.\ "
  The world is facing a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in the fight against a spreading coronavirus epidemic, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday. The UN agency has been sending testing kits, masks, gloves, respirators and gowns to every region, he told the WHO executive board in Geneva. \"This afternoon I will be speaking to the pandemic supply chain network to identify the bottlenecks and find solutions and push [for] fairness in distribution of equipment,\ " he said. He said demand is up — and so are prices. The leader of the WHO said he spoke to manufacturers, distributors and logistics providers to make sure that supplies like N95 masks get to the health-care workers who need them. \"There is limited stock of PPE and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most,\ " he said. The first priority is health-care workers, he said, followed by people who are sick and caregivers. \"We all have a part to play in keeping each other safe,\ " he told reporters who gathered for the daily briefing in Geneva.

  Premier Jason Kenney announced Saturday the province would be sending personal protective equipment or PPE to other provinces battling COVID-19. Kenney made the announcement from an Alberta Health Services (AHS) warehouse while espousing the province's readiness for the pandemic. \"Our numbers are far lower than the hardest hit areas of Europe, the United States and significantly lower than we've seen in provinces like Quebec and Ontario,\" he said.   Kenney said Alberta is so far outperforming the probable scenario of models released earlier this week, which predicted as many as 800,000 infections. \"We are at about one quarter of the modelled levels under the probable scenario for today, and that is very good news,\ " he said, adding it was not reason to halt collective efforts to stop the spread.

  It was a crazy cruise adventure for a Sault Ste. Marie couple who were stuck on a cruise ship with passengers infected with COVID-19. Bill Purnis and his wife are finally back home in Sault Ste. Marie. That's where we reached Bill to find out more about his cruise experience. 9:20 Sault Ste. Marie's Bill Purnis says it's good to be home, after being on a cruise that started March 7, around the same time the world was being alerted of a global coronavirus pandemic. Purnis said he and his wife Flo MacLeod thought they were safe from the pandemic because they were at sea. But the virus was on board, sickening about 200 people, and killing four. VideoFour dead aboard Holland America cruise ship near PanamaVideoCanadians on board quarantined cruise ship anxious to get homeVideoFormer Diamond Princess passengers struggle with isolation PTSD First week of cruise 'wonderful ' Purnis said the the cruise line, Holland America was 'terrific the whole time,' and that the first week of the cruise was wonderful. Once the captain determined he needed to get his passengers home, he attempted to dock at numerous ports. \"The captain headed down to the tip of Argentina when he was told that Chile was going to close its borders at a.m. the next morning, so he turned around and went back where we were and got there in time. But they said, 'Oh sorry. We changed our mind. We closed them at 12:00. You can't dock,\ " Purnis recalled. \"So the captain said, 'well we can't sit here for 14 days ... and sailed up the coast of Chile toward Fort Lauderdale, eventually.\ " The big worry ahead was whether or not the ship would be able to make it through the Panama Canal. \"We had to go through at night,\ " Purnis said. \"The captain came on and directed everyone to turn out all their lights. The inside ones and the outside ones, because we had to pass by a sensitive area where people didn't really want us to go through. If they couldn't see us they couldn't know we were there.\ " After passengers aboard the MS Zaandam began falling ill with COVID-19, the cruise ship line Holland America sent another ship to isolate passengers who were not sick. About 800 people were moved, including Sault Ste. Marie's Bill Purnis and his wife Flo MacLeod. (Bill Purnis) Waiting for help Being on board with sick passengers was stressful for everyone. \"We were only worried once the captain said that four people had died,\" Purnis told CBC Morning North radio host Markus Schwabe. \"We didn't remember who we were in contact with. There were more crew sick than passengers at one point.\ " Finally they were told another ship, the Rotterdam, was coming down from California to meet them and help them out. \"So they transferred 800 of us over. You had to be healthy and pass the screening to be allowed on the other one,\" he said. \"We thought maybe they were going to be limited to 100 ... but they did get 800 over.\" Passengers were confined to their rooms. \"But you could look down the hallway and see little arms and head come out to take in the food trays,\ " Purnis added. \"We did get a beautiful balcony when we moved to the Rotterdam ...   we were right at the back of the ship with a tremendous view of the water ... that's all we saw for several days.\ " Once the ship reached Florida, things were still tenuous, as there was talk that the Americans weren't going to let passengers leave. \"I guess it came down to a lot of letters that had gone from Canadians down to the governor of Florida and all those involved,\ " Purnis said. \"It was interesting going from the ship to the airport. We had 24 police motorcycles escorting the seven buses.\"   Getting home It took the couple about four hours to get through the airport process, including customs. The plane back to Canada was packed, which raised people's stress level even more. Physical distancing was not an option. Gloves and masks were essential for everyone. Once the couple landed in Toronto, they thought they were home free. Ten minutes before take-off, they were told they couldn't board their flight to Sault Ste. Marie. \"Even though we had clearance with Health Canada, Transport Canada had not [and] it was not going to let us on.\"   When the clearance memo finally came through, they managed to get a flight to Sudbury. Two of their children drove two vehicles down from Sault Ste. Marie and they were able to drive the rest of the way home. Purnis says he's grateful for the support they've received from family and friends throughout the ordeal. \"It would've been different without e-mail or phone. It would have been quite scary.\ " He also said it's a relief to no longer be wearing face masks all the time. \"It's so nice to be talking without a mask,\ " Purnis said.   
  More than 100 students from northern Ontario, studying in various health care professions, are helping to make sure their counterparts on the front lines have personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect from COVID-19. Last week, the medical, nursing and other health care students began an initiative called Northern Ontario PPE for HCP.  HCP stands for health care providers.   Similar groups have popped up elsewhere across the province, and are in collaboration with the Ontario Medical Student Association and the Ontario Medical Association. They are all working to source PPEs for doctors, nurses and other health care providers in the region,to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. Personal protective equipment includes N-95 masks, face shields, gowns, gloves and goggles.   COVID-19 by the numbers in northeastern OntarioSudbury's Health Sciences North issues plea for personal protective equipment \"Our campaign happens to be very different from the campaigns in southern Ontario because we are covering all of northern Ontario and not just the major cities,\ " Sarah Mavin said.   She is one of the co-leads, and is also a student at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) in Sudbury.

The sourcing group then tries to fill that need with any donations that may have come in. \"If we can't do that , we look at sourcing across a broader northern Ontario, and even if we can't source from there, we have our contacts through the Ontario Medical Association who will help us source from southern Ontario, as well,\" she said.

Federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough joined the briefing by health officials to announce how many Canadians have applied for the government's Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).   She said just over 750,000 new applications were filed on Tuesday alone, for a total of 1.72 million since Monday, when people born in January, February and March were asked to start applying.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated at his daily briefing that the federal government is working to help people in the so-called gig economy who currently don't qualify for CERB — including those who work fewer than 10 hours a week.   More help on the way for youth, businesses taking financial hit from COVID-19 : PM  Alberta and Quebec released grim projections on Tuesday for the human cost the coronavirus outbreak could exact on each province, with Premier Jason Kenney suggesting Alberta won't be able to start relaxing physical distancing measures until the end of May. Public health officials in Quebec projected that between 1,200 and 9,000 people there could die from COVID-19 by the end of the month. Following an afternoon announcement, the officials hastened to add that the projections were based on countries which were slow to act, and that the province is trending toward the lower end of projections.

Later Tuesday evening, Kenney said his province's \"probable scenario\" modelling showed the virus could kill between 400 and 3,100 people in Alberta by the end of summer, while the \"elevated\" numbers suggested as many as 6,600 could die in the same time frame. The premier warned the province could see as many as 800,000 infections during that period. But he added, \"These numbers are not a done deal.\" Instead, Kenney said he wants Albertans to see them as a challenge to work harder to slow the rate of infection.   Calling it \"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation,\ " he laid out a plan to deal with saving lives and rebuilding the economy.    Canada to produce 30,000 ventilators Earlier Tuesday, Trudeau announced Ottawa is working with companies to try to produce 30,000 ventilators. He said the country's hospitals' ability to treat COVID-19 depends directly on a \"sustainable, stable supply,\" of critical products. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Trudeau said Canada will partner with manufacturers, including Thornhill Medical, CAE  and a group led by StarFish Medical, to produce 30,000 of the machines, which are critical for those suffering from the worst effects of the illness.

  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.   WATCH |  Dr. Samir Gupta explains what you should consider before putting on a mask against COVID-19: Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Which mask is recommended for health-care workers? For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic.

Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask?

A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  Canadian officials are working day and night to buy, ship and encourage the domestic manufacturing of much-needed personal protective equipment, according to a senior government official, as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues.   \"It is no secret that we are operating in a highly competitive global environment, and this comes with challenges,\ " said Bill Matthews, deputy minister for the Department of Public Works and Government Services. \"The entire world is scrambling to get the same materials from a finite number of suppliers, most of whom are located in China.\"   Matthews is one of the officials responsible for making bulk purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks and gloves. He told MPs on Wednesday that the government has had to completely restructure how it buys such medical supplies. \"Limited availability of many of these products is resulting in buyers overbidding,\ " Matthews said. \"Established orders are often redirected to those willing to pay the most.\" To ensure that Canada has the supplies it needs, the government has employed a three-pronged strategy.   The first part of that strategy involves seeking out and buying all of the PPE supplies it could find to meet the short-term needs of Canadians.    The second: placing massive orders of supplies, much more than Canada needs in the short term. That aggressive strategy, Matthews said, ensured that the orders were big enough to keep the attention of international suppliers.   The third part of the plan has been to sign supply agreements with Canadian companies that are retooling to make N95 masks, face shields and gowns.   Large orders pending All of the supplies that are acquired by Ottawa are turned over to the Public Health Agency of Canada to distribute to the provinces on an as-needed basis. Federal acquisitions are separate from those done by the provinces or territories.   Matthews said that, as of Monday, millions of items had arrived from domestic and international suppliers, and more are expected:  17 million surgical masks, having ordered 293 million.   609,000 N95 masks, from orders for 130 million.   Five million pairs of gloves, having ordered 900 million.   Delivery has also started on about 20 million litres of hand sanitizer, he said, and 17 million face shields have also been ordered.  Hockey equipment manufacturer Bauer is helping to fulfil that order, Matthews said.   As CBC News reported earlier this week, ensuring that those orders actually arrive has required the establishment of a Canadian-run supply chain in China.   That effort, said Matthews, involves having Canadian staff in China vetting companies to ensure they can produce products that meet Canada's standards.   Cause for cautious optimism in Canada's COVID-19 fight, top doctor saysCanada building its own PPE network in China Once companies have signed supply deals, officials from Canada go onto the factory floor to test products coming off the line and to ensure that each shipment goes directly to a Canadian-operated warehouse at a Chinese airport.   Another team of Canadian officials ensures that the shipments clear Chinese export controls and clear customs so that supplies can be loaded onto a charter flight bound for Canada. Matthews said that this approach is seeing supply planes arrive in Canada with new supplies every couple of days.  
  Briefing notes prepared by bureaucrats for federal ministers show just how quickly the COVID-19 situation evolved in Canada — with public health officials stating the risk of transmission in Canada was low right up until early March, only to recommend an ordered shutdown of economic life in this country some two weeks later. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Thursday that it could be as long as a year before normal life returns in Canada — a dramatic change in messaging, considering how Public Health Agency of Canada officials were advising policymakers less than two months ago that COVID-19 risks were low in this country, and that mandatory quarantines for returning travellers would be too difficult to enforce. Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in CanadaTHE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 6 A March 10 department-drafted briefing note prepared for Health Minister Patty Hajdu ahead of question period said that, with just 12 cases being reported nationwide at that point (even though publicly available numbers had already climbed higher), \"the risk of spread of this virus within Canada remains low at this time.\ " The note also said the public health system is \"well-equipped to contain cases coming from abroad, limiting the spread in Canada.\" A month later, Canada has more than 21,000 cases. As the documents show, as early as Jan. 28 the World Health Organization (WHO) was describing the risk of COVID-19 transmission as \"very high\" in China and \"high at the global level.\" Early messages from bureaucrats to Health Minister Patty Hajdu never hinted at the eventual scope of the pandemic. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) The tranche of documents, prepared by various government departments and tabled with the Commons Health committee late Wednesday, include many of the early planning memos that informed the federal government's response to COVID-19 in January and February. They show that while the government was seized with repatriating Canadians from China's Hubei province and various cruise ships during that time, there was little talk of a possible pandemic. Public health officials questioned the accuracy of media reports out of the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, suggesting that the virus was spreading through person-to-person contact. WATCH |  Trudeau says there will be 'an awful lot of learning' about COVID-19 response Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responds to reports that show officials were slow to respond to the risk COVID-19 presented in Canada. 3:14 \"Based on the latest information that we have, there is no clear evidence that the virus is easily transmitted between people,\" a Jan. 19 briefing note prepared for Hajdu said. The documents also reveal that the government was reluctant to strictly police travellers arriving from Hubei, the region of China where the novel coronavirus is thought to have originated. ' Next to impossible' to stop COVID-19: minister According to talking points prepared for a Jan. 30 call with her provincial and territorial counterparts, Hajdu said preventing the virus from arriving in Canada was \"next to impossible\" because of the nature of global travel. \"What really counts is limiting its impact and controlling its spread once it gets here,\ " the talking point reads. Three days later, the U.S. barred all non-citizens coming from China from entering the country. While there were information booths at major Canadian airports starting on January 21, the decision to collect personal contact information from inbound Hubei travellers was only made on Feb. 19 — information that could then be used by public health officials to follow up with people if an outbreak emerged. Scenes from a pandemic: passengers arrive at the Calgary Airport after being briefed on mandatory self-isolation rules March 25, 2020. (THE CANADIAN PRESS) The government relied on individuals to self-report to Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers if they were experiencing flu-like symptoms, long after temperature monitoring measures were commonplace at airports in Asia. Between Jan. 22 and Feb. 18, 58,000 travellers arrived in Canada from China — 2,030 of them were coming from Hubei province. Only 68 were pulled aside for further assessment by a quarantine officer and only three passengers were actually flagged for a medical exam — the other 65 passengers were sent away with a pamphlet. It's impossible to know how many pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers were released into the general Canadian population. Bureaucrats warn against mandatory quarantines On Feb. 7, the government started recommending that inbound Hubei passengers start to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days to prevent transmission. In an undated memo to Hajdu sent in mid-February, department officials warned that Canadians may question the effectiveness of \"voluntary\" self-isolation measures for these travellers. But the memo says \"there is no ability to enforce or ensure compliance\" with a mandatory isolation order without the use of the Quarantine Act — a measure the government would end up invoking weeks later. The memo said it was best to leave all self-isolation measures as voluntary to ensure there is \"less pressure on public health resources.\" The memo said public health officials didn't have the capacity required to quarantine passengers from China; 20,000 such travellers were arriving in Canada each week at the time. The Public Health Agency scrubbed any references to China in pamphlets disseminated to returning travelers starting on Feb. 24, after it was clear that there was community spread of COVID-19 in countries like Iran and Italy.   I think we've seen countries around the world caught off guard by the nature of this epidemic.- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Calls between Hajdu and her provincial and territorial counterparts later in February focused on quarantine facilities for returning Hubei and cruise ship travellers in Trenton and Belleville, but said little about how the various jurisdictions would respond if COVID-19 escalated. According to briefing notes for a Feb. 10 call, Hajdu said that while the country was in a \"containment phase, we cannot ignore what comes next.\ " The note states that the Public Health Agency of Canada was \"doing advanced thinking and scenario analysis, including a pandemic scenario,\" but it's not clear if those scenarios were actually discussed with provinces and territories on that call. The pandemic has made N95 masks rare and coveted objects. (Michael Wilson/CBC) Health Canada expected Hajdu would be pressed by the provinces about the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the call. The department told her then there were ongoing \"attempts\" to secure devices like N95 and surgical masks for the national stockpile but \"deliveries were staggered by industry due to mounting market pressures.\ " It said it had procured only a \"modest\" amount of the masks — items that would be badly needed a month later. By Feb. 26, when there were 78,000 COVID-19 cases in mainland China, public health officials continued to counsel Hajdu that \"the public health risk within Canada remains low.\" A month later, there would be 1,000 cases in Ontario alone. Even after the number of suspected COVID-19 cases in Canada started to rise by mid-February, Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg did very few tests, with most of them reserved for travellers from China. It is now understood there was widespread transmission of the disease in Europe and in some U.S. hotspots like New York by this time. By Feb. 17, the national lab had run only 461 tests — a marginal increase from the 367 tests run the week before. By Feb. 25, Ontario and B.C. had provincial labs ready to test but the other provinces were still relying on sending samples to Winnipeg — a cumbersome process that made it difficult to identify and isolate cases in the other provinces early on. Canada will learn from this ordeal: Trudeau When asked Friday about the briefing notes, Trudeau said Canada moved earlier than some other countries on countering the potential spread of the virus. \"As we look back, of course there's gonna be things we said,'Oh, we might have said this differently or that differently,\" he said. \"There's going to be an awful lot of learning through this, but it remains that as we get through this now, as we live through the measures that we've put in place and lean on each other and hold together, we have the best chance of getting through this in the coming weeks and months by remaining true to the advice that experts are giving us.\" WATCH | Trudeau warns Canadians need to remain vigilant Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said normal life for Canadians will not return until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed 2:32

P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office issued a statement to CBC News saying, 'guidance suggests not touching the body of the deceased' who died of COVID-19.    (Kzenon/Shutterstock) With less strict control measures, those numbers jump to 14,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths by June 1. David Ferguson, president of the P.E.I. Funeral Directors and Embalmers Association, said funeral homes are prepared and trained to deal with COVID-19 deaths should they happen on the Island.   \"If you have the proper guidelines and the proper training, you can use best practices and you can deal with it because you are helping a family's loved one,\ " said Ferguson. \"We'd be naive to think that a person wouldn't be a little concerned dealing with the virus.\" Last week, the Chief Public Health Office issued a statement to funeral homes urging them to take universal precautions when dealing with deceased, even if the person is not known to have COVID-19.   Funeral home staff normally wear business attire when picking up a body. But all that has changed. By taking universal precautions, funeral home staff now have to wear protective gear, including gloves and masks, when picking up a body. ' Not touching the body' Funeral homes have also incorporated the question \"Is this death related to COVID-19?\" into their first conversation with the institution where the individual died. If the answer is yes, funeral home staff will wear full personal-protective equipment when picking up a body. David Ferguson, president of the P.E.I. Funeral Directors and Embalmers Association, says funeral homes are prepared and trained to deal with COVID-19 deaths should they happen on the Island.    (David Ferguson ) During the embalming process, funeral homes are taking even greater measures if the person had COVID-19.   Costello said typically, standard embalming procedures call for regular protective equipment such as masks, disposable aprons, and gloves. If the person died of COVID-19, they would also wear impermeable gowns, boot covers, N-95 respirator masks, double gloves, hair nets and face shields on top of standard personal-protective equipment, she said.   According to the province, funeral homes already have specific procedures and policies in place for working with people who have died of communicable diseases, which will be followed in the event of a death related to COVID-19. Ferguson said each funeral home has a limited amount of personal-protective equipment and can borrow from other funeral homes, if necessary.  The province said if additional equipment is needed it can also supply funeral homes through the Island's central distribution and allocation centre.   The Chief Public Health Office said, \"guidance suggests not touching the body of the deceased,\" who died of COVID-19 to ensure the virus is not transferred to the loved one. This applies both at the time of death as well as the wake or funeral. The province does say embalming or cremation is still possible if somebody dies of COVID-19.   ' Things are going to have to change' Zain Esseghaier, a spokesperson for the Muslim Society of Prince Edward Island, said COVID-19 will dramatically change the rituals should somebody die of the coronavirus from his community.   Zain Esseghaier, a spokesperson for the Muslium Society of Prince Edward Island, says COVID-19 will mean changes to the rituals should somebody die of the coronavirus in his community.

  The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) says it is not accepting donations of homemade masks, gowns or other personal protective equipment.   SHA said it will accept things like unopened and sealed boxes of non-latex gloves, disposable gowns and masks, but are asking that people not deliver them directly to their facilities. SHA will be accepting donations from suppliers, industry associations, companies and organization drives. If you have supplies to donate you can email procurement@gov.sk.ca. They also do not want anyone dropping off food or beverage donations for health-care workers to share. SHA said it appreciates the support, but they follow guidelines set out by the chief medical health officer. Supplies running low Jennifer Prive started to turn to homemade equipment as personal protective equipment supplies start to run low. Prive, who works out of Regina as a continuing care assistant, said masks are harder to come by every day. \"[Cloth masks], at the end of the day, we can wash them and sterilize them to be able to use them over again when we go to our clients the next day,\" she said. Prive said she wants to ensure that frontline workers can be kept as safe as possible throughout the crisis. Do cloth masks work? The effectiveness of cloth masks hasn't been studied much and would depend on the type of fabric, said Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff for Humber River Hospital in Toronto. \"They do tend to be quite porous,\ " he added. Which masks should healthcare professionals be wearing? It varies, according to Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask. Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols, like inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages).

  At least twenty front-line staff at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre cannot go to work, as they were exposed to a potential case of COVID-19. The hospital said the staffers worked with a potential case of the virus, but did not don the personal protective equipment (PPE) required, as the case was not confirmed positive. Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre notes issues with handwashing, staffing levelsEmployee at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre tests positive for COVID-19 Currently, staff only wear complete PPE when there is a confirmed positive case, to help ration the supply of equipment. Global shortages of PPE have meant the hospital is now collecting N95 masks for potential reuse. \"In this instance, exposure is associated with a patient who, through the course of admission, has moved through several areas of the hospital,\" said Tracie Smith, the hospital's senior director of communications and engagement in a e-mailed statement. \"The patient recently developed symptoms associated with COVID-19, has been tested, and is therefore considered a presumptive case. Self-isolating staff include those who had exposure to the patient prior to the onset of the patient's symptoms.\ " Smith said staff isolation would be discontinued if and when the patient's test results were returned as negative. \"[Staff are] not allowed to go to the work environment because they could potentially spread,\" said Dr. Stewart Kennedy, who leads the hospital's COVID-19 pandemic team. \"So, it's having an impact on our workforce not having in-house testing here. And, I know I keep harping on in-house testing, but that is critical.\ "  Kennedy has been pushing for the hospital to have its own testing lab, but that has not yet been established. Thunder Bay District Health Unit confirms three new cases of COVID-19 The hospital will also no longer use locums who reside outside of the city, to help slow any spread. The facility had been working on reducing its reliance of locums over the past year, but still used the physicians to help fill gaps in the hospital schedule. However, Kennedy said the hospital has now fully opened its dedicated COVID-19 unit, with patients moved in throughout the day on Monday. The hospital is also looking at providing accommodations for staff working on the dedicated unit, which could be a local hotel, or at Lakehead University or Confederation College. The hospital will also provide new scrubs for each staff member on the dedicated COVID-19 unit to change into and out of at the hospital. The laundering of scrubs is not normally provided to floor staff at the hospital. Kennedy said he anticipates another dedicated COVID-19 unit will be necessary at the hospital to accommodate all patients. 
  As COVID-19 spreads in Canada, the advice from medical professionals on how to stay safe has evolved.   At first, Canadians were told to wash their hands and avoid large groups. Within weeks, they were locked down in states of emergency and told to keep their distance from anyone not in the same household.   The federal message about masks has also changed. They're now considered reasonable in public settings such as public transit and grocery stores, where physical distancing can be hard to maintain. But health officials urge people to wear non-medical masks, such as bandanas, scarves and home-made masks, and to  save the medical supply of surgical masks and N95 masks for health-care workers. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now. Here are your top questions answered by chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell.   4:39 In New Brunswick, the advice has shifted too.   The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, initially said that only health-care workers needed to wear masks. Now she is now matching federal advice and suggests masks may be a handy tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19. N95 masks should be used by healthcare workers only. They come in different sizes to make sure the barrier is tight.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) \"We are suggesting that if you are going to wear a face covering that it be the homemade kind,\ " Russell said. The masks aren't for your protection, explained Russell, but for the protection of others, and to make sure your droplets aren't getting on other people. \"This does not replace hand hygiene and it doesn't replace social distancing,\ " she said. Mask-wearing should not replace hand-washing, says Russell. You should also wash your hands before donning your home-made mask and after removing it. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Russell said mask-wearing can help combat community spread of COVID-19. \"We do understand that there is a risk of transmission in those settings,\ " she said. \"We don't believe that it's the driving force of the transmission, but we know we can play a part and this is just one of those precautionary pieces of advice that we're giving people.\" \"Arming people with knowledge, arming people with information so they can take good proper steps to protect themselves and others … is really important.\ " When should you wear a mask?   Russell suggests wearing a mask in public, especially in places where you can't properly maintain two metres of distance between yourself and others.   \"Running errands, grocery shopping,\" she said.   If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate, call 811 or your doctor, and generally refrain from going out in public. But if you have a slight cough, or seasonal allergies, a mask might help protect the spread of any germs or droplets.   \"If you're wearing a facial covering it means that if you do cough, not only do you have the protection of your elbow but it's going to be trapped in the fabric somewhat,\ " she said. What about at work? As to whether you can and should wear a face covering at work, Russel said \"that would be something that you'd have to work out with with your employer.\ "  If you can't maintain two metres of distance while at work, a face-mask might be a good tool to use. But, Russell added, employers should also ensure social distancing i the workplace is happening, too. What's the difference between medical and home-made masks?   N95 masks and surgical masks are used by health-care workers who are on the front lines in hospitals around the world.   N95 masks come in different sizes so as to provide the best barrier against germs. They sometimes come with a filter on the front, and are purpose-built to solely protect the user from small particles. If you have a supply of surgical masks like these, Russell says there's nothing stopping you from using them, but she hopes people will consider donating them to the province.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) Surgical masks are also used in lower-risk health-care settings. They are typically made with three layers of fabric to filter any germs or larger respiratory particles, and they are disposable. N95 masks are in high demand around the world, said Russell, so it's important to leave them for healthcare workers.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) These are not the masks the public should be buying or wearing though, said Russell. N95 masks are in high demand, and stockpiles in hospitals around the world are getting low, which is why it's so important to save these masks for nurses and doctors.   Russell said even if you have a pre-existing medical condition, don't buy a medical mask. Distancing, isolation, and hand-washing measures are the best way to keep yourself safe.   \"People who are wearing the homemade facial coverings, they are doing their part in terms of protecting those people who are at higher risk,\" she said. Where can you get one?   Russell said non-medical masks can be made at home, and she pointed to resources from the Centers for Disease Control. Some people have even shared mask-making patterns on Pinterest, said Russell. \"Whatever pattern you choose, however you decide to make it, whether it's a sewn one or one that's not sewn, there have to be no gaps around your face. So when it is fitted onto your face there can't be any big gaps,\ " she said. Some sewers suggest using quilting fabric or fabric in a double-layer to make the masks, but you can even use an old T-shirt, according to the CDC. Masks made at home should be large enough to cover your mouth and nose, and should have no gaps on the sides.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) The mask should also be comfortable, said Russell, otherwise you won't want to wear it. It should also be large enough to cover both your nose and mouth.   If you currently have a stock of surgical masks, Russell said there's nothing stopping you from using them, but would rather see people donate them to the province's stockpile.   More information around how exactly to donate to that stockpile will be coming out very soon, said Russell.    How do you use it?   The mask should fit comfortably on your face and around your ears and should have no visible gaps. \"Wash your hands when you put it on, and wash your hands when you take it off,\ " said Russell. Masks like this one can be worn in public places where maintaining two metres of distance is difficult, like on public transit or in a grocery store.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) It's also important to wash the mask every day, or else germs will just stay on the fabric.   \"I would not want people to just wear these facial coverings without making sure that they're doing proper hand hygiene and actually washing the material that the mask is made of,\" she said. As for how to clean the masks, hot, soapy water should do the trick, but other cleaning advice is available online.   \"If you washed it in hot soapy water at a good high temperature that would suffice,\ " Russell said. \"But there could be other cleaning advice as well that you would find resources for.\ "

The death rate — that is, the number of dead relative to the population — is still far higher in Italy than in U.S., which has more than five times as many people. And worldwide, the true numbers of dead and infected are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, different counting practices and concealment by some governments.

(Ben Nelms/CBC) Inside Canada's frayed pandemic early warning system and its COVID-19 response As COVID-19 quietly incubated in Wuhan, China, last fall, public health officials in Canada were looking for gaps that needed to be closed in their long effort to upgrade this country's online pandemic early warning system. Few people outside a tight circle of highly specialized epidemiologists and federal bureaucrats had ever heard of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) before the novel coronavirus became a global pandemic. The online, multilingual monitoring and analysis unit, which scours the internet for media reports of infectious diseases, has been a crucial pandemic tripwire for both Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO). Records obtained by CBC News show GPHIN was in the middle of a long-overdue technology upgrade as the virus was spreading. Despite almost four years of work with the National Research Council of Canada, the early warning system was — as of last fall — still in need of \"improvement in the geographical and time tagging algorithm,\" according to a Nov. 12, 2019, presentation to a WHO conference in Seoul by senior epidemiologist Florence Tanguay. It is difficult to understate the importance of the Canadian network, said one of the country's leading intelligence experts. \"The Global Public Health Intelligence Network was meant to perform a critical warning task with regard to the COVID-19 ... outbreak. This was its job,\" said Wesley Wark, a University of Ottawa professor. \"It should have been at the heart of a Canadian and indeed a global early warning system.\" Created in 1997, GPHIN is credited with helping spot the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. During those previous outbreaks, the network issued rolling email alerts to those governments and the WHO as the viruses it was tracking appeared in new countries. The documents obtained by CBC News raise questions about whether that practice of issuing specific alerts was followed in the case of COVID-19. The decision to issue those warnings would have been up to PHAC.

Legault said he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students, to ease the staffing crisis. The challenge, said Legault, is finding health-care workers able to work full-time at the same long-term care facility for at least a two-week period. Legault said there are now \"two worlds\" in the province. One is in long-term care homes, known as CHSLDs, where the situation remains critical. But outside the CHSLDs — and outside the greater Montreal region, which is the epicentre of the pandemic in Quebec — the situation is improving. \"We're moving in the right direction,\ " he said. Read more about the situation in Quebec   Trudeau announces $9B in financial aid for students struggling because of pandemic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced $9 billion in financial aid for post-secondary students, pending Parliament's approval, in response to claims that too many young people were falling through the cracks in existing COVID-19 support programs. Under the proposed program, students would be eligible for $1,250 a month from May through August. That sum can go up to $1,750 if the student is taking care of someone or has a disability. The benefit would also be available to students who have jobs but are making less than $1,000 a month, and payments would be made through the Canada Revenue Agency. As well, the prime minister said the federal government is doubling student grants for eligible students — up to $6,000 for full-time students and up to $3,600 for part-time students. Trudeau also announced more than $75 million in additional supports for Indigenous post-secondary students and raised the maximum weekly amount that can be provided through the Canada student loans program in 2020-2021 from $210 to $350. Read more about the announcement   Muslims try to keep Ramadan spirit amid COVID-19 restrictions  As Ramadan begins with the new moon later this week, Muslims around the world are trying to maintain the cherished rituals of Islam's holiest month without further spreading the outbreak. At the heart of Ramadan is the sunrise-to-sunset fast, but the month traditionally sweeps everyone up into a communal spirit as families and friends gather for large meals at sunset, known as iftars. Many countries have closed mosques and banned evening prayers to prevent crowds, while prominent clerics have urged people to pray at home. \"In light of COVID-19, we've had to become creative,\" said Ali Chahbar, an outreach co-ordinator for the London Muslim Mosque in London, Ont. The London Muslim Mosque's Imam Amin Al-Ali has been releasing daily videos offering spiritual guidance. The same goes for the London chapter of the Muslim Association of Canada and the London Islamic Centre. \"Ramadan is synonymous with social engagement and we're being told to social distance,\ " Chahbar said. \"The pandemic really compels you to reflect and go inside, not just inside your house but also inside yourself.\" Read more about this year's Ramadan   THE SCIENCE Should I be concerned about the outbreak at the Alberta meat-processing plant? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Earlier this week, Cargill temporarily closed its High River, Alta., meat-processing plant after one worker died and hundreds more became ill. Is the meat from this plant at risk? Likely not, since COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, there have been no reported cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of the coronavirus. \"The virus is passed through person-to-person contact,\" said Siyun Wang, associate professor at the faculty of land and food systems at the University of British Columbia. \"What happened in the meat-packing plant in Alberta was also due to person-to-person contact.\ " This means it's unlikely any consumers could be at risk. Jeffrey Farber, director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety and a professor at the University of Guelph, says while it is \"theoretically possible,\" the actual risk is \"extremely low.\ " So what happens if a droplet manages to land on your meat? Farber said the period of time it takes for that product to reach your dinner plate would also result \"in a further reduction in any viral particles that may be present.\" Cooking meat also destroys the virus. AND FINALLY... Indigenous artists use traditional crafting techniques to create face masks amid pandemic Marlana Thompson from Akwesasne created this face mask in the traditional Haudenosaunee raised beading style 'so that we don't forget what happened.' (Submitted by Marlana Thompson ) Some Indigenous artists are channelling their anxieties about the COVID-19 pandemic into making unique face masks using traditional crafting techniques and materials. \"During the pandemic, I'm trying to learn to relax and do stuff for me,\" said Marlana Thompson from Akwesasne, a Mohawk community straddling the Ontario, Quebec and New York state borders. She created a mask adorned with beaded strawberries, cedar and spruce needles in the traditional Haudenosaunee raised beading style. The mask also says \"C-19 2020\" to commemorate the pandemic. Thompson said she believes that this is a time for reflection and that there are good things coming out of the situation like families coming together and people taking more control over their lives and the food they bring into their homes. \"I think it's a wake-up call for everybody to be cleaner and more mindful of where they are and how they live their lives,\ " she said.

  The funeral home chapel may be desolate, but the phone is still ringing. Mortality is no stranger during a pandemic, but COVID-19 is bringing complications for businesses that deal with death.   \"Death doesn't just stop. It's not like we're a service that can't continue,\" said David Root, the general manager at Pierson's Funeral Service in Calgary. Funeral homes are listed as an essential service in Alberta.  That comes with a host of new challenges as they struggle to adapt to increasing demand and fewer resources.   Grieving from a distance: How COVID-19 changes customs around funeralsAre dead bodies contagious? Your COVID-19 questions answered Alberta's COVID-19 death toll of 72 remains comparatively low. Independent of the pandemic, funeral homes say they are experiencing a busy quarter and that will only intensify as virus-related deaths grow.   Many homes in Calgary have split their staff into groups for safety. They work in rotating shifts so that if an infection brings down one crew, the facility can continue to operate with the other. It's not a perfect strategy.   \"You only have half the amount of people to do the same amount of work that you normally would,\ " Root said. But there's a larger problem occupying him.   \"The biggest concern we have is how do we protect ourselves from contracting the coronavirus,\ " Root said. He's already held the funeral of someone who died of it in a continuing care home. They're taking extra precautions. The staff at Pierson's have started wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, gowns, face shields and masks. But there's a looming shortage.   PPE is 'the new contraband' PPE in the province has been earmarked for hospitals, family doctors and other medical staff. Alberta's funeral homes are running out.   \"It will be a concern the longer that this goes on,\" said Evan Strong, the owner of Evan J. Strong Funeral Home. He added he understands the necessary hierarchy of PPE distribution, but wants the government to understand the position funeral homes are in as well. There have been questions about whether a deceased person can transmit COVID-19, but Health Canada has no clear answer at this point.   The virus can live on surfaces for varying lengths of time. Stephanie Smith, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, said it's possible for the virus to live on a body but the risk is lower.   A person wears personal protective equipment, which includes an N95 respirator, mask and nitrile gloves. Some of this gear is used by funeral homes when handling the deceased. (CBC/Radio-Canada) \"Any kind of infection would have to be transmitted directly from touching the deceased person and then touching one's face, nose, mouth,\" she said.   She said despite that, the difficulty funeral homes are having trying to procure PPE should be addressed.   Alberta recently sent millions of pieces of the medical equipment to Ontario, Quebec, B.C. and the Northwest Territories. \"PPE is kind of the new contraband,\ " Smith said. \"Everyone in the world is trying to access it.\ " The province says they're working to get gear to funeral homes. In the meantime, requests for PPE can be sent directly to them. Funeral business suffering like other industries Like most other businesses in the province, COVID-19 hasn't been kind to funeral homes.   \"With some families electing to do reduced or no services, of course the side effect is that our revenues will be down and therefore our bottom line,\ " Root said. Funerals, like the rest of public gatherings, are beholden to the chief medical officer of health's public restrictions. Currently, that means no more than 15 people spaced two metres apart. Anyone found violating those rules can be fined $1,000. As the concerns of infections and staff safety dominate the planning funeral homes are doing, there are also thoughts about what this means for the future.   Funeral home chapels like this one are often closed because of COVID-19 gathering restrictions.   (Pierson's Funeral Service) The future of funerals Death is an estimated $1.6 billion business in Canada and the business model hasn't been overhauled in some time. COVID-19 could be the start of a transformation.   \"This is changing how we grieve,\" Strong said.   With families unable to gather, many in-person funeral services are obsolete. Instead, funeral homes are turning to the Internet.   Many are starting to offer a livestream of services and are opening online portals to upload photos. Funerals are going digital.   P.E.I. funeral homes worry about 'potential of becoming infected,' prepare for COVID-19 deathsCOVID-19 pandemic changing how Windsor-Essex funerals are conducted Strong says he sees this as part of the job. \"What we focus on [now] is trying to come up with creative ways or helpful ways that the family can still mourn and celebrate the life.\ " Both funeral home directors say the toughest part has been seeing the grief families are experiencing while spread so far apart.   \"We're being unique and innovative and trying to find good ways of having families still have healing experiences as they go through the experience of death,\ " Root said. 
  As both Italy and the United States harness the manufacturing power of their defence sectors to address shortages of medical equipment desperately needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signalled Thursday he'd be prepared to do the same thing as the federal government ramps up its response. \"We are considering any measures necessary to ensure Canadians and our health care systems have the supports they need,\ " the prime minister said at his now-daily media briefing outside of Rideau Cottage, where he remains in self-isolation after being exposed to the virus. \"We have already been engaged with industry on production and ramping up capacity to build and create more equipment. We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well. There's a range of things we can do and we will do what is necessary.\ " All options on the table Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland reinforced that message later in the day, saying cabinet is working hard on getting the necessary medical equipment \"and we're looking at every single option, every single possibility.\" The cabinet committee struck to manage the novel coronavirus crisis was due to hear a presentation from Public Services Minister Anita Anand on procurement Thursday afternoon. The prime minister suggested in his remarks his government would have something more to say on the subject in the coming days. Freeland, meanwhile, said Thursday the cabinet is \"going to look at what the military can do\ " — one of the govermment's most direct references to date to the possibility of calling on the nearly 100,000 regular and reserve members of the Armed Forces to help with the pandemic response. The Italian government recently tasked the country's military with helping a local manufacturer ramp up production of pulmonary ventilators — life-saving devices in short supply in many countries. Demand can still be met within Canada: Hajdu Public health officials in Canada have stressed all week that Canada is not running short of ventilators and have said that provinces have been able to tap into a federal equipment reserve to access the devices. On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu suggested that future demand for medical equipment could still be met by manufacturers in Canada. In Washington that same day, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Defence Production Act, a sweeping piece of legislation which allows the U.S. military to produce (among other things) personal protective equipment, including face masks, to slow the spread of the pandemic. Watch: Does Canada have enough ventilators to treat COVID-19? Fearing a potential shortage of ventilators, one rural Canadian doctor has rigged up a fix. 2:04 Earlier this week, the U.S. Air Force flew 500,000 swabs for COVID-19 testing kits from Italy to Memphis, Tennessee. Many of the companies that manufacture the kits have factories overseas, and getting them into the U.S. and on commercial cargo jets for distribution is a priority. The Air Force says it will transport test kits in support of U.S. Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department in order \"to make sure that we're meeting the demands that they have.\ " Canada has similarly sweeping legislation that allows the defence minister to \"buy or otherwise acquire, utilize, store, transport, sell, exchange\" and dispose of defence equipment. The Canadian law also gives the Department of National Defence the power to \"manufacture or otherwise produce, finish, assemble\" such equipment in an emergency. No time to 'quibble' over jurisdiction: Freeland Freeland said no option is off the table. \"Let me be very clear with everyone that we will spend whatever it takes to support the health and safety of Canadians,\" she said. While acknowledging divided jurisdictions and political differences, Freeland said the federal government is not going to \"quibble\" over federal and provincial spheres of responsibility and \"the federal government is prepared and is taking the lead, and that very much includes the health care system.\ " Hajdu said her officials are working with provinces and territories to determine what kind of equipment they might need to meet the surge in new cases, but noted provinces have been tapping into the federal stockpile. \"It's very difficult to talk about exact numbers because it's like a revolving door,\ " she said Thursday. \"There's materials coming in and just as fast as they're coming in, they're going out.\ " There does not appear to be a nationwide estimate of how many ventilators might be required because individual provinces are responsible for their own health care systems. Canada's health sector at risk of cyberattacks as COVID-19 fear spreads: CSEGovernment expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health ministerUpdatedCanada orders military members on leave abroad to return home, self-isolate \"I think trying to ask for a specific number is a bit misleading for Canadians because so much depends on … our efforts to flatten the curve,\ " Hajdu added, referring to the goal of preventing a sudden spike in cases that would overwhelm hospitals. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said the federal government has received no specific requests from provinces for ventilators and that a mechanism is in place that would allow provinces to share the devices. The federal government also is adding to its own strategic stockpile by ordering more, she said. Separately, Tam said, the government has made a procurement request for seven million face masks — an order that is only 75 per cent filled. Canada's business community volunteered its services earlier this week and federal officials have been talking to a number of companies, with a focus on those already producing protective equipment. 
  The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit said a fourth person has been diagnosed with COVID-19 in our area.   Chief medical officer of health, Dr. Wajid Ahmed, said this latest case was also related to travel, but that it was only \"a matter of time\" before we see a \"community case.\" \"The risk to Windsor-Essex ... is increasing,\" said Ahmed.   The fourth case is a man in his 60s who travelled in the U.S., returning to Canada on March 13. He was seen at the local assessment centre after developing coronavirus symptoms, and was tested on March 20. The health unit reached out to \"all contacts\" of the man and advised those people to self-isolate and monitor themselves for symptoms.   \"It's just a matter of time before we get there,\ " said Ahmed, explaining that transmission in Detroit is happening within the community. \"As much as we can do to prevent transmission in our community, that's what we have to do.\ " Ahmed explained that community cases are people who have not travelled or had contact with someone who has, and have contracted the virus through someone locally.   Watch the health unit's Wednesday March 25 update here:   Ahmed said a testing facility has now opened in London, Ont . and he hoped that test results can be returned quickly.   Here's what else is happening in our area: Health unit wants tighter borders On Tuesday the health unit called on both levels of government to clarify and tighten rules around border travel, especially for Canadian workers. \"The U.S.-Canada border continues to be a concern for the residents of Windsor-Essex and for the health unit,\" said Ahmed.  \"We are concerned about the travel to and from work in Michigan for our residents of Windsor-Essex ... They may need to go to work, and we're asking for stronger measures.\" Ahmed said the number of COVID-19 cases in the City of Detroit alone is nearly on par with the number of cases in the entire province of Ontario. He said he's fearful, since two of the three confirmed cases in Windsor-Essex are people who work in Michigan.   In an email, Ontario's Public Safety Ministry said they \"recognize the importance of maintaining our supply chains and ensuring that people who do essential cross-border work can continue to do so.\" \"As we take a whole-of-government approach to addressing COVID-19, we are constantly evaluating the situation and considering next steps,\" reads an except from the Public Safety Ministry's email. \"We will continue to work with health authorities, border officials, provincial and territorial counterparts, municipalities, and our international partners to do what's best for Canadians.\ "  Windsorites are making DIY face masks, regardless of effectiveness   St. Clair College donates medical equipment to help local hospitals in case of COVID-19 influx   Detroit-area hospital system 'almost at capacity' Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned Tuesday that a Detroit-area hospital system was \"almost at capacity\" treating people with the coronavirus, as the state's stay-at-home order kicked in to reduce the spread. The governor, speaking about her measure with Detroit radio station WDET-FM, pointed to Beaumont Health, which has eight hospitals in Wayne and Oakland counties and describes itself as Michigan's largest health care system. \"Let's be very clear: Beaumont Health is almost at capacity right now. We have not seen the worst of it yet,\ " she said. \"The numbers are going to continue to climb.\" Other COVID-19 cases in Windsor-Essex The health unit confirmed the region's third case of COVID-19 on Monday, informing residents that a man in his late 40s who works in Michigan and lives in Windsor-Essex has been diagnosed.   The man developed symptoms on March 15 and was tested at the Windsor Regional Hospital assessment and testing centre. This case has no connection to the two other cases previously confirmed over the weekend by the region's public health unit   A man in his 20s, who is employed at a healthcare facility in Southeastern Michigan and lives in Windsor-Essex County, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the health unit said on Saturday.   A man in his 60s who returned to Windsor after travelling on a Caribbean cruise was confirmed by the health unit on Friday.   City of Windsor taking steps to ease burden on residents The City of Windsor said there are child care options available for emergency support workers battling the COVID-19 pandemic. The city is also surveying those workers to gauge the need for an emergency childcare centre in the city.   Windsor city councillors are set to hold a vote on deferring property tax payments for at least 90 days.   Council's agenda for another special meeting on Wednesday morning lists property tax relief as an item.  
 Manitobans can help reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 by wearing non-medical masks, chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says. While symptomatic people account for most of the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, there is growing evidence of asymptomatic spread as well, and wearing a covering can help prevent that, Roussin said at a news conference Monday morning. \"If you choose to wear a non-medical mask , if you go out in the public, you may be protecting others,\" he said. However, that still isn't the best way to protect others, Roussin said. There have been 204 cases in the province between March 10 and April 6, public health officials say. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC) \"I don't want [masks] to be a distraction. The real message is to stay home.\ " Previously, Roussin said masks aren't necessary to protect people from COVID-19 and that they should be practising physical distancing and hand hygiene.

Our goal isn't to remain consistent, but respond to the information as it comes,\ " he said. People who do wear masks should clean them frequently, be careful not to touch their mouth, nose or eyes with them and clean their hands often, he said. They should also maintain their physical distancing and stay home as much as possible. Roussin's comments come after a similar message from the nation's top doctor.

The number of active cases, meaning people who are still experiencing symptoms of the virus and have not recovered, is 185. There are still 11 people in hospital and seven in intensive care, he said. Although only one new case was announced Monday, Roussin wasn't optimistic about the future. \"Don't expect many days like this,\" he said. Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa said there are still 14 heath-care workers infected with the virus. As of April 4, 12,514 COVID-19 tests had been performed in Manitoba. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC) The Cadham Provincial Lab completed 458 tests on Sunday; as of Monday, a total of 13,476 tests have been performed. The province is looking at expanding testing criteria, Roussin said, but wants to ensure that's sustainable and that high-risk people remain a priority. ' Stay home' Roussin reiterated people should stay home and not go out in public, even to places of worship, especially given upcoming religious holidays, including Passover, Easter and Ramadan. \"We know from other jurisdictions that a lot of transmission has occurred at faith-based gatherings,\" he said. Few people are venturing out on Winnipeg streets due to physical distancing measures aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) \"You're not only putting yourself at risk but all Manitobans at risk when you attend gatherings like this.\ " With the weather improving, Roussin also discouraged people in the province from going to their cabins because they could overwhelm smaller health-care centres if they become sick. WATCH  | Full news conference on COVID-19 | April 6, 2020: Provincial officials give update on COVID-19 outbreak: Monday, April 6, 2020. 58:21 He discouraged people from going to busy parks where staying two metres apart is difficult. \"If you did want to take in a park, you've got to be absolutely sure you can maintain that physical distancing.

  Concerns about coronavirus are causing a sales run on a number of supplies in Windsor-Essex pharmacies, and even though there have been no cases of COVID-19 in the area, one pharmacy owner said his customers are worried.   Tim Brady is a pharmacist and the owner of Brady's Drug Stores in Belle River and Essex.

Brady is \"concerned\" about potential shortages, but is more concerned that the people stockpiling medicine will cause supply shortfalls.   \"When people produce [medications] they're assuming on a regular dispensing ... so if everyone comes in and gets twice as much as normal it could cause an issue,\ " he said. \"We're trying to tell everyone to take it easy.\ " Watch: How to protect yourself against COVID-19: Make sure your prescriptions are up to date, says this Canadian infectious disease expert. 1:21 The biggest problem Brady facing is the shortage of masks.   \"All the suppliers are out,\" said Brady. \"And the newest casualty is hand sanitizer.\ " Brady said he doesn't usually sell many masks and now has customers coming in to buy them by the dozens.

INTERACTIVE | See the latest data on COVID-19 cases in Canada.   As global reported coronavirus case numbers pass one million — including 12,549 known cases in Canada — governments are scrambling to secure critical supplies, implement tough public health measures and deal with growing job losses.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with the country's premiers on Thursday about a range of issues, including the shortage of protective gear for health-care workers, an issue that emerged again Friday amid concern over whether Canada was getting the equipment it needs from abroad, including from the United States. Speaking outside Rideau Cottage on Friday, Trudeau said his government is \"confident\ " Canada will receive the necessary equipment. He said the government would do everything it can to ensure no part of Canada goes without the supplies it needs during the pandemic. Trudeau said his government has been working \"very closely\" with the Americans to make clear that essential supplies, products and services flow both ways between Canada and the United States every day, highlighting the example of nurses from Windsor, Ont., who travel to Detroit to work.   \"These are things that Americans rely on and it would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back-and-forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.\" WATCH | Trudeau talks about controversy around cross-border flow of critical supplies: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacts to the news that the Trump administration has ordered a major manufacturer 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 1:43 Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday that the Canadian-American relationship is very important. She said during a pandemic, \"all relationships\" face challenges and the cross-border one is no exception. Canada continues to work with 3M and its U.S. partners, Freeland said, adding that the government is working with a range of suppliers around the world. \"We are totally seized of this issue,\ " Freeland said when asked about the need to get medical workers critical supplies.   WATCH |  Freeland reacts to Trump administration's 3M order:   Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says the government will \"pull out all the stops\" in response to the Trump administration's decision to order 3M to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada. 3:03 When asked about the U.S. blocking medical exports, Freeland said the Canadian government is prepared to do \"whatever it takes\" to defend the national interest. The prime minister said the government has signed a deal with Amazon Canada to use its distribution network to send medical supplies to meet provincial needs. Ontario releases coronavirus projections Faced with rising case numbers and tighter restrictions, there have been some calls for more information from governments about what is expected and what information is driving decisions. Trudeau has said that such national modelling is coming \"soon,\" but that the federal government requires more data from provincial and territorial governments — a subject he discussed with premiers during his more than two-hour first ministers' conference call. WATCH | Public Health Ontario head projects between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths over pandemic's full course:   The best case scenario for the number of COVID-19 related deaths in Ontario is 3,000-15,000 over the full course of the pandemic, says Dr. Peter Donnelly, the CEO of Public Health Ontario. 2:56 Ontario released its provincial projection and modelling information on Friday, with Premier Doug Ford saying that he wants the province's residents to know \"what I know.\ " The modelling projects the coronavirus crisis could last 18 months to two years and kill 3,000 to 15,000 people, even with public health measures in place. \"Had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\" said Public Health Ontario CEO Peter Donnelly, referencing the province's physical distancing and other measures. \"Thankfully, that is not the position we are in.\"   CBC EXPLAINS |  What you need to know about the new COVID-19 emergency wage subsidy 5 myths about preventing, detecting COVID-19   Donnelly said he understands these figures may seem \"scary, intimidating\" and to many, \"unlikely.\ " But, he said, every year about 1,350 people die from normal seasonal flu. In a bad year, 1,500 people die. \"When you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and you remember we have no vaccine, and we have no specific treatment …  then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible.\" A health-care worker wearing protective gear walks in front of a COVID-19 assessment centre at the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto on Friday. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press ) On Friday, Ford implored Ontarians to do their part to help ease the burden on the province's hospitals and announced more shutdowns — including some construction projects. Given the projections released today, it was the right thing to do, he said. \"Everyone has had to pay a price in this war,\ " he said. \"Daily life has ground to a halt.\" Speaking ahead of the release of the Ontario figures, Trudeau said again that \"how we get through this depends on you,\" and that Canadians are \"looking to do the right thing.\ " Trudeau has reiterated daily the need to practise physical distancing, stay at home whenever possible and practise proper hand hygiene.

Trudeau also said Friday that the Canadian Armed Forces will assist in northern Quebec to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in isolated communities, at the provincial government's request. The Rangers, which are part of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve and provide a Canadian Armed Forces presence in northern and isolated communities, will help set up tents and other medical equipment, as required by the communities.

Germany's low death rate from coronavirus has drawn international attention. Experts say the difference compared to other countries is partly due to mass testing and well-equipped hospitals, but they caution that the number of deaths is likely to rise.

(Emrah Gurel/Associated Press) Cuban officials say a shipment of coronavirus aid has been blocked by the six-decade U.S. embargo on the island. Cuba was one of 24 countries in the region meant to receive the donations announced March 21 by a foundation started by China's richest person, Jack Ma, but officials say the cargo carrier of Colombia-based Avianca Airlines declined to fly the aid to Cuba because its major shareholder is a U.S.-based company subject to the trade embargo on Cuba. The embargo has exceptions for food and medical aid, but companies are often afraid to carry out related financing or transportation due to the risk of fines or prosecution. Human-rights groups have been calling for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba and Iran during the pandemic in order to permit the flow of more aid. The Trump administration has argued only the countries' governments would benefit from the sanctions relief. 
  The federal government is finalizing a plan to boost production of ventilators and other medical equipment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior government sources tell CBC News they're hoping to work with existing manufacturers — especially of gloves, masks and ventilators — on a supply chain that's resistant to disruption. An announcement is expected from the prime minister on Friday, which will also encourage other industries to retool their production lines to make those products. In addition, sources say, almost every program within the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development will be \"refocused\" on fighting the virus. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly.   Major federal programs — such as the Strategic Innovation Fund, a pool of money set aside by Ottawa in 2017 to \"spur innovation for a better Canada\"; and the $950-million Innovation Superclusters Initiative — will be \"tasked to be part of the solution,\ " one source said. WATCH | PM says military procurement could help produce medical equipment: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not rule anything out when it comes to ensuring Canadians have access to enough medical equipment, including using military procurement as a possible option. 0:47 The National Research Council of Canada, the country's primary research and development organization, will also be part of the response. The goal, the source said, is \"to fight COVID and help come up with a cure.\" Ventilators in particular, could spell the difference between life and death for many patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus which can damage the lungs. Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said that while there is no current shortage of ventilators, federal officials are trying to prevent one by managing existing inventories and securing more of the machines — preparing for the possibility that the COVID-19 caseload could start overwhelming hospitals. In a conference call with more than 300 Canadian business leaders on Thursday afternoon, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains said he is looking at \"how we use our current industrial capacity to … build some of those very essential pieces of equipment, from ventilators, to gloves, to gowns, to masks.\ " Federal cabinet considers leveraging military in mobilizing health manufacturing sector against COVID-19No Indigenous community will be 'left behind' in COVID-19 response, says minister Bains said he is \"finalizing some of these details\" with cabinet to fast-track procurement. \"Those are going to be critical for frontline health workers and how we deal with this crisis,\" he said on the call. The World Health Organization warned last week of global shortages and price-gouging on ventilators and personal protective equipment, and urged companies and governments to increase production by 40 per cent. Canada's automakers and aerospace manufacturers have recently been in talks with federal officials about stepping in to fill critical shortages of medical supplies. Both the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and Aerospace Industries Association of Canada said they have spoken to officials from Ottawa. Meanwhile, high-end parka maker Canada Goose said it's in discussions about making medical gowns. Its retail stores and in-house production facilities are closed until at least March 31. While working with companies already producing medical supplies is the preferred option, the sources say everything is \"on the table.\" But getting non-medical companies to produce unfamiliar, emergency medical equipment is no simple task. They face significant hurdles before they could build a complex piece of equipment like a ventilator, while other products need to be manufactured in a sterile environment. Government expanding COVID-19 testing capacity and purchase of medical equipment, says federal health minister It's not clear how long it would take for companies to reinvent themselves. Auto industry insiders say, for example, the process could take months for car companies. In the United States, auto giants General Motors and Ford said they have been chatting with the Trump administration about making ventilators. On Thursday, the prime minister said Canada might also use its military procurement policy to get medical equipment. \"We are considering using any measures necessary,\ " Justin Trudeau said at a news conference outside his home. \"We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well.\ "
  Thousands of sorely needed protective masks are at a Winnipeg UPS store, ready to be shipped to front-line health-care workers at a hospital in northeastern China in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak. The Manitoba chapter of Not Just Tourists had more than 5,000 N95 small particulate masks donated months ago because they were considered surplus, donation co-ordinator Dolores Friesen said. \"That is the type of mask you need to use to protect yourself if you're working with a virus such as the outbreak that's going on in China right now,\ " Friesen said. \"We had several boxes of these masks just sitting there, not sure how we were going to get these masks ever used.\ " Not Just Tourists pairs travellers with suitcases of surplus medical supplies such as gauze, syringes and surgical instruments to take with them wherever they go.  While they're on vacation, they drop off the suitcase at a clinic or hospital registered with the organization. Up until now, there wasn't much demand for these particular masks. Not Just Tourists is sending N95 masks to a hospital in Hebei province. The small particulate masks are hard to get in China right now. (Submitted by Dolores Friesen) Then Friesen, who is a nurse, heard from a former colleague and friend, Dr. John Ducas, a St. Boniface Hospital cardiologist who volunteers with an organization called Bethune Bai Qiuen Canadian Alliance, which provides health-care support for hospitals and clinics in China. A doctor Ducas has worked with a number of times got in touch recently, desperate for N95 masks. More than 1,700 health-care workers in China have been infected with COVID-19, including five who died. The novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout China, even though Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled and the government has promoted hand-washing, wearing medical masks and seeking immediate medical attention. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization announced a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment in every region, but especially China.   The WHO is working to distribute the equipment to those who need it, and health-care workers are the first priority. Manitoba teachers in China get temperature checks, tracking app amid coronavirusFormer Winnipegger living in China relieved quarantine is ending Although the hospital the masks are going to isn't in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, it's still in need, Ducas said. \"It's at least 500 kilometres away, but that doesn't stop a virus,\ " he said. \"This is a relatively large hospital. There's lots of people in and out of there. This is a potential hazard to the health-care workers and to the patients. There are Chinese health-care workers that have gotten this infection and have died.\" 'Horrendous' to be without Friesen knows first-hand how important personal protective equipment is. She was a nurse in a Winnipeg intensive care unit when serious respiratory illnesses SARS and H1N1 were on the minds of Manitobans and claiming lives around the world. \"I can understand how important it is to get these supplies in the hands of the people that need it, like, right now,\ " she said. \"I can't even imagine what it would be like to be doing that and not have enough supplies to protect yourself. …  That would just be horrendous.\ " Medical workers pump oxygen for a new coronavirus patient at a hospital in Wuhan in central China. (Chinatopix/The Associated Press) The boxes of masks are at a UPS store in Winnipeg, waiting to be shipped out, as Ducas sorts out the customs rules with his colleagues in China. The masks likely would be thrown away if it wasn't for Not Just Tourists. \"These are supplies that would have been thrown in a landfill here and instead, they're now going to be repurposed for something really important,\" Friesen said.

  Not more than two hours after the premier of the Northwest Territories described the COVID-19 pandemic as an \"invisible war we are fighting,\" recruits in that battle have new advice — use disposable or reusable face masks when in public to slow the spread of COVID-19. An unsigned press release Tuesday afternoon from the N.W.T. Office of the Chief Public Health Officer stated that it \"now recommends residents use reusable or disposable cloth face coverings when in public places.\ " According to the press release, although non-medical face masks cannot eliminate all contact with droplets potentially containing the novel coronavirus, they were found to be effective in limiting the droplets to spread further from people who are not aware they have COVID-19.   \"This is a way to help each other help ourselves — if everyone wears face coverings while in public, we can limit the spread of COVID-19.\ " The recommendation follows recent advice from Canada's chief public health officer who said on Monday that Canadians can use non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures to limit the transmission of COVID-19 when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19 According to recent statements from Dr. Kami Kandola, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer, cases of COVID-19 in the N.W.T. have so far been confined to individuals who had returned from travel. There is no so-called community transmission of the virus in the N.W.T. Community transmission of the virus is the spread of an illness with no known link to travel or previously confirmed cases. It can signal a growing number of unreported cases. Some of the masks by Sydney Wolf in Yukon, as Whitehorse sewers make cloth masks to meet high demand. (Submitted by Sydney Wolf) No one from the territory's Department of Health and Social Services was immediately available to comment on the new advice to wear a face mask in public. The press release emphasized that wearing a face mask does not replace previous advice or orders regarding physical distancing, hand washing or self-isolation. The advice also does not apply to employers, or anyone else who must comply with Workers' Safety and Compensation Commission guidelines. Community effort already underway Wilbert Cook, the executive director of the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, said his organization has been working on a project that would see home-made masks made and distributed for free in all communities in the Northwest Territories. Wilbert Cook, the executive director of the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, says a program to get masks made in N.W.T. communities was already underway. (Randall McKenzie/CBC) The timing of Cook's project was coincidental with Tuesday's recommendation. He said the foundation is trying to get one or two people from each community to help sew masks. \"We will provide the material and supplies,\ " Cook said. Cook said he hopes to have work underway within a couple of weeks, but the foundation will need cash and materials to make it happen. \"We're looking for both fabric and cash donations but we're going to be applying to the federal government for funds to implement that project.\" This Yellowknife couple is using 3D printing to make masks more comfortable Do-it-yourself (DIY) efforts such as these fit in with the government recommendation to wear face coverings in public. \"We absolutely encourage these DIY creations and applaud those already setting up sewing clubs,\" states an email from the N.W.T. office of the press secretary. \"[We] encourage residents to tag the government of the Northwest Territories Facebook page and the Twitter account of our chief public health officer Dr. Kami Kandola with photos of them wearing their DIY creations.\" Yukoners sew homemade cloth masks to meet high demand Yes to cotton, no to polyester According to the press release, face coverings could include home-made coverings, but they must:   Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face   Be secured with ties or ear loops   Include multiple layers of fabric   Allow for breathing without restriction   Be able to be washed and machine dried without damage or change to shape with hot temperatures   According to the press release, disposable material such as layers of tissue or paper towels can be used, but should be disposed of after each use.

  People in Waterloo region, along with people across the province, are being told to avoid gathering in groups of five or more. The province announced the new order Saturday night as a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There have been 69 confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo region, although, acting medical officer of health Hsiu-Li Wang has said public health is not testing everyone. Currently, healthcare workers and hospital patients are the priority when it comes to COVID-19 testing. As of Sunday morning, 11 people were in hospital. There is also one case that has since been marked as resolved, meaning the patient has received two negative tests in a row for COVID-19 after previously having had the virus.   Region of Waterloo Public Health is expected to give its next update on Monday morning. Universities, college donate supplies Waterloo region's universities and college are donating items to local hospitals to help healthcare workers deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The science faculty at the University of Waterloo went through classrooms and labs to find personal protective equipment to donate to local hospitals. \"While we may be facing uncertain times, it's uplifting to see some of the efforts being made to help out across campus,\ " a person said on the @WaterlooSci Twitter account.   Conestoga College also gathered equipment to donate including N95 masks, gloves and protective equipment.   The college also has ventilators, beds, stretchers, mattresses and other equipment they use for students to learn hands-on skills that will be donated.   Ayr-based company Stage Door Transportation has offered to move the equipment for the college, the school said. Conestoga president John Tibbits said in a release that the school is happy to be \"sharing our resources to protect front-line workers and provide additional capacity for hospitals.\ "  The University of Guelph is also going through labs to find equipment to donate. The school recently delivered 10,000 N95 masks to Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. The school says it's also collecting disinfectant wipes, nitrile gloves, hand sanitizer, surgical masks and isolation gowns while the Ontario Veterinary College will donate ventilator equipment.

  With no domestic production of crucial N95 masks for health-care workers on the COVID-19 front lines, Canada's federal government is bulk-buying tens of millions of them on the international market to meet short-term demand. The Trudeau government's announcement Tuesday that it will spend up to $2 billion to procure personal protective equipment — including more than 60 million N95 masks — comes weeks into a global pandemic and raises questions about Canada's emergency preparedness.   Health care workers around the country say they have been rationing the protective N95 masks while they wait for stocks to be replenished. Because there are currently no domestic manufacturers of N95 masks, pressure put on the global supply by the coronavirus pandemic has left Canada in a precarious position. Only medical masks such as those labelled N95, sometimes called respirators, are designed and fitted to filter out the tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce only some aerosol particles. AnalysisAre Canadians ready for sustained sacrifices in the age of COVID-19? We're about to find outMade-in-Canada ventilators, masks, test kits coming soon: Trudeau Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Tuesday that the federal government is \"aggressively buying in bulk from all available suppliers and distributors.\"  The same day, Quebec Premier François Legault said protective equipment for hospitals, including masks, was just days away from running out. Call for domestic production went out 11 days ago The government said Tuesday that it has inked deals with three Canadian companies — Thornhill Medical, Medicom and Spartan Bioscience — to make ventilators, surgical masks, test kits and other items, but the more than 60 million N95 masks it has ordered are all coming from foreign suppliers. Anand said deliveries will start next week. It was just 11 days ago that the federal government put out a call to domestic businesses and manufacturers \"to help deliver critical health supplies.\ "  Normally, local health authorities in each province purchase their own protective gear, but given the global supply shortages in recent weeks, the provincial ministries and now the federal government have had to step in.   Canadian hospitals getting 'creative' to expand COVID-19 care facilitiesCanada Goose making scrubs, patient gowns for hospitals in light of COVID-19 shortages Last Friday, Health Canada told CBC News that the Public Health Agency of Canada was deploying N95 masks and other protective gear from the national emergency strategic stockpile.   Ontario Premier Doug Ford said last week in a radio interview that the province was working with an automotive supply company — Woodbridge — in Mississauga, Ont., on production of N95 masks, because a world-leading supplier, the multi-national corporation 3M, was swamped with international orders. 3 M not manufacturing N95 masks in Canada According to St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M's website, the company is currently producing 100 million N95 masks a month globally. Much of that production is in Aberdeen, S.D. Its subsidiary, 3M Canada, has several manufacturing plants in this country, but according to an online statement, the company does not manufacture N95 masks in any of its Canadian facilities.   CBC News contacted 3M Canada president Penny Wise on Monday to ask whether the company would retool any of its Canadian factories to meet demand in Canada. Wise's office did not answer the question, saying instead that the company had doubled the amount of N95 masks brought into the country during the first three months of 2020. Wise did not say how many masks that is.   N95 masks are designed to filter 95 per cent of airborne particles. (Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters) The federal government announced Tuesday that it \"was in the process of finalizing an agreement\" with the Montreal-based protective equipment manufacturer Medicom to start N95 and surgical mask production in Canada.   \"We need a sustainable, stable supply of these products, and that means making them at home, and we are optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks,\ " Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. Industry Minister Navdeep Bains said at the Tuesday press conference that the ability to produce the masks within Canada remains \"a core objective of ours.\ " Surgical masks only But the proposed Medicom manufacturing site won't be up and running for months. According to the company, neither the location nor the number of facilities that will be producing masks has been decided. It is aiming to start production in early summer.   In the short term, Medicom has a separate agreement with the federal government to supply \"tens of millions\" of surgical masks only. Sask. Health Authority CEO says he knows 'for a fact' staff involved in stealing masks, gloves from hospitalsPoint of View: Patience, please — waiting for cancer surgery during a pandemic Medicom's chief operating officer, Guillaume Laverdure, told CBC News there have been no discussions in the past with governments in Canada about domestic production of protective masks. \"Manufacturing locally is more expensive than importing from China. That's a fact,\ " he said. \"So, in times where provincial hospital budgets are tight, there is a natural tendency to go to the cheapest possible product.\ "  Workers inspect newly made surgical masks at a factory in Hong Kong. (Isaac Lawrence/AFP via Getty Images) Laverdure said the new paradigm is that governments are willing to pay a little more as long as they have access to products locally. Health-care workers have been relying in part on corporate donations of personal protective gear to help bridge the supply gap.

The announcement came days after an investigation by CBC News found Canadian airline workers and their unions have complained about lack of protective equipment — such as protective suits or gowns, and mandatory testing — and several flight attendants became sick with COVID-19. \"I've asked several times, 'Why are we not wearing hazmat suits?'

(Francis Ferland/CBC) Other communities The public health unit in the Belleville, Ont. , area is asking people only call it at 613-966-5500 if they've checked the website and still have questions. The same advice goes for Leeds, Grenville and Lanark's unit at 1-800-660-5853 extension 2499. Hawkesbury, Ont., has an assessment centre at 750 Laurier St. open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.   Like Ottawa, only go there if you have new or worsening symptoms and have travelled or been in contact with a confirmed case. Go to CHEO if you're looking after an infant younger than six months old that fits this description. Self-isolate if you have mild symptoms, go to the hospital if your symptoms are severe. The Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) is also working on a special \"Community Paramedic Program\" for home visits. Only people older than age 70, who have chronic health problems or compromised immune systems can call 613-933-1375 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to ask about one of these visits. On Friday, the Winchester District Memorial Hospital announced it is preparing an assessment centre with the help of the EOHU. The hope is the facility will never have to be used, the hospital wrote in a release. Renfrew County is providing home testing under some circumstances. Its public health unit says people who have symptoms or have been in close contact with a confirmed case should use the province's self-assessment tool. Call Telehealth​​​, their health care provider or it at 613-735-8654 if they still have more questions. The province of Ontario generally advises people experiencing symptoms to call Telehealth or their health care provider. There has been a lag of four days or more to get Ontario's test results, with more being done per day than can be processed.   In the Outaouais, the local health agency is calling anyone whose tests take more than a week to get back to them. First Nations communities The Mohawk communities of Akwesasne and Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (MBQ) have declared a state of emergency to prepare for possible cases. Anyone in MBQ who has symptoms can call 613-967-3603 to talk to a nurse. A home test may be possible after that. In Akwesasne, community members are asked to carry their status cards when crossing the Canada-U.S. border for essential trips. The Algonquin communities of Kitigan Zibi and Pikwakanagan have scaled back non-essential services and are asking residents to follow public health advice.

  As COVID-19 spreads in Canada, the advice from medical professionals on how to stay safe has evolved.   At first, Canadians were told to wash their hands and avoid large groups. Within weeks, they were locked down in states of emergency and told to keep their distance from anyone not in the same household.   The federal message about masks has also changed. They're now considered reasonable in public settings such as public transit and grocery stores, where physical distancing can be hard to maintain. But health officials urge people to wear non-medical masks, such as bandanas, scarves and home-made masks, and to  save the medical supply of surgical masks and N95 masks for health-care workers. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now. Here are your top questions answered by chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell.   4:39 In New Brunswick, the advice has shifted too.   The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, initially said that only health-care workers needed to wear masks. Now she is now matching federal advice and suggests masks may be a handy tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19. N95 masks should be used by healthcare workers only. They come in different sizes to make sure the barrier is tight.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) \"We are suggesting that if you are going to wear a face covering that it be the homemade kind,\ " Russell said. The masks aren't for your protection, explained Russell, but for the protection of others, and to make sure your droplets aren't getting on other people. \"This does not replace hand hygiene and it doesn't replace social distancing,\ " she said. Mask-wearing should not replace hand-washing, says Russell. You should also wash your hands before donning your home-made mask and after removing it. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Russell said mask-wearing can help combat community spread of COVID-19. \"We do understand that there is a risk of transmission in those settings,\ " she said. \"We don't believe that it's the driving force of the transmission, but we know we can play a part and this is just one of those precautionary pieces of advice that we're giving people.\" \"Arming people with knowledge, arming people with information so they can take good proper steps to protect themselves and others … is really important.\ " When should you wear a mask?   Russell suggests wearing a mask in public, especially in places where you can't properly maintain two metres of distance between yourself and others.   \"Running errands, grocery shopping,\" she said.   If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate, call 811 or your doctor, and generally refrain from going out in public. But if you have a slight cough, or seasonal allergies, a mask might help protect the spread of any germs or droplets.   \"If you're wearing a facial covering it means that if you do cough, not only do you have the protection of your elbow but it's going to be trapped in the fabric somewhat,\ " she said. What about at work? As to whether you can and should wear a face covering at work, Russel said \"that would be something that you'd have to work out with with your employer.\ "  If you can't maintain two metres of distance while at work, a face-mask might be a good tool to use. But, Russell added, employers should also ensure social distancing i the workplace is happening, too. What's the difference between medical and home-made masks?   N95 masks and surgical masks are used by health-care workers who are on the front lines in hospitals around the world.   N95 masks come in different sizes so as to provide the best barrier against germs. They sometimes come with a filter on the front, and are purpose-built to solely protect the user from small particles. If you have a supply of surgical masks like these, Russell says there's nothing stopping you from using them, but she hopes people will consider donating them to the province.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) Surgical masks are also used in lower-risk health-care settings. They are typically made with three layers of fabric to filter any germs or larger respiratory particles, and they are disposable. N95 masks are in high demand around the world, said Russell, so it's important to leave them for healthcare workers.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) These are not the masks the public should be buying or wearing though, said Russell. N95 masks are in high demand, and stockpiles in hospitals around the world are getting low, which is why it's so important to save these masks for nurses and doctors.   Russell said even if you have a pre-existing medical condition, don't buy a medical mask. Distancing, isolation, and hand-washing measures are the best way to keep yourself safe.   \"People who are wearing the homemade facial coverings, they are doing their part in terms of protecting those people who are at higher risk,\" she said. Where can you get one?   Russell said non-medical masks can be made at home, and she pointed to resources from the Centers for Disease Control. Some people have even shared mask-making patterns on Pinterest, said Russell. \"Whatever pattern you choose, however you decide to make it, whether it's a sewn one or one that's not sewn, there have to be no gaps around your face. So when it is fitted onto your face there can't be any big gaps,\ " she said. Some sewers suggest using quilting fabric or fabric in a double-layer to make the masks, but you can even use an old T-shirt, according to the CDC. Masks made at home should be large enough to cover your mouth and nose, and should have no gaps on the sides.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) The mask should also be comfortable, said Russell, otherwise you won't want to wear it. It should also be large enough to cover both your nose and mouth.   If you currently have a stock of surgical masks, Russell said there's nothing stopping you from using them, but would rather see people donate them to the province's stockpile.   More information around how exactly to donate to that stockpile will be coming out very soon, said Russell.    How do you use it?   The mask should fit comfortably on your face and around your ears and should have no visible gaps. \"Wash your hands when you put it on, and wash your hands when you take it off,\ " said Russell. Masks like this one can be worn in public places where maintaining two metres of distance is difficult, like on public transit or in a grocery store.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) It's also important to wash the mask every day, or else germs will just stay on the fabric.   \"I would not want people to just wear these facial coverings without making sure that they're doing proper hand hygiene and actually washing the material that the mask is made of,\" she said. As for how to clean the masks, hot, soapy water should do the trick, but other cleaning advice is available online.   \"If you washed it in hot soapy water at a good high temperature that would suffice,\ " Russell said. \"But there could be other cleaning advice as well that you would find resources for.\ "
  The demand for homemade masks in Yukon is high — and it's been that way since even before Canada's chief public health officer said it could be beneficial to wear them in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.    In a change from her previous stance, Dr. Theresa Tam now says non-medical masks could be worn as an additional measure to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.    But many Yukoners didn't wait for Tam's go-ahead to put in their mask order.  The owner of a sewing and repair store in Whitehorse said she's already made about 200.   Some of the masks by Martinez. She's made about 200 cloth masks so far at her shop, Renueva, in Whitehorse.

(Karen McColl/CBC) Sydney Wolf, an apprentice tailor by trade, is also making masks, but from the comfort of her home. Wolf is immunocompromised and said she first made masks for herself and her husband. After that, people started asking her to make them. She's made about 90 so far. Wolf said the repetition of making them helps her deal with the anxiety she feels about the pandemic. Sydney Wolf started getting orders for cloth masks after she made them for herself and her husband. (Submitted by Sydney Wolf) \"I love sewing. I figured I should do something to help other people, too. It makes me feel really, really good.\ " Both Wolf and Martinez sell masks in various sizes. Cloth masks could reduce chance of infecting others Tam previously said there was no need for healthy people to wear masks. While she still maintains that medical masks should be reserved for front-line health-care workers, she now says that wearing a non-medical mask, along with following physical distancing measures, can limit the transmission of COVID-19.

  Jayson Koblun sat in the back of a vehicle with the windows down and a bandana tied around his face as his wife drove him to the Urgent Care Clinic on Main Street West. She waited in the parking lot as he entered the facility and approached the masked security guard who sat behind a fibreglass booth. Koblun was getting tested for COVID-19 at one of the city's two designated assessment centres. A work trip to Las Vegas left him battling short breaths, a fever and at the mercy of intense, phlegm-filled coughing fits, stealing any chance of a good night's sleep. \"In my head , I was like, 'Well, of course, it's not going to be me,' \" said Koblun, who works as an editor for a pair of trade magazines. The Urgent Care Centre on Main Street West of one of two COVID-19 assessment centres in Hamilton — this location is where Jayson went to get tested. (Submitted by Google Maps) But as he passed the security guard heading in for his test on Sunday, about a week after returning to Hamilton on March 14, he wasn't sure what to think. After swapping his bandana for a mask and washing his hands, the fit 30-year-old sat down in a chair and waited.   \"It looked like something they just created overnight,\ " he said. ' It's not going to be me ' Koblun saw about five others getting tested that day, a pleasant surprise compared to the image of a room stuffed full of sniffling people he conjured up in his mind. As each person left, nurses wiped down the seats, replacing their gloves each time. Armed with his health card, Koblun approached another nurse sitting behind a booth of her own, wearing a mask, gloves and full scrubs before he was called to sit inside a room. Workers appeared in good spirits, joking with one another. Others walked by wearing visors.

This Hamilton doctor answers your questions about COVID-19 Eventually, Koblun had his blood pressure and temperature checked. And finally, came the test for COVID-19. Koblun tilted his head back and pulled his mask down just beneath his nostrils. Then, the nurse inserted a cotton swab up his nose. \"It was almost like I could feel it behind my eyebrow,\" he said. \"Before she did it, I even said 'Are you going to touch my brain?' \ " Koblun left the facility shortly after, through a different door. He was there for about 45 minutes and went home with some sheets to guide him through self-isolation. \"They seemed like they knew what they were doing,\" he said. But it had taken him more than a day of calls to TeleHealth and listening to dead air for what seemed like a lifetime, before eventually setting up an appointment directly through Hamilton Public Health Services for the test. Positive or negative? He's now trying to keep his distance from his wife and he's sleeping on the couch while she takes the bed. He'll need to self-isolate for 14 days after his first day without symptoms. Koblun knew a test wouldn't lead him to any kind of medicine to alleviate his symptoms, but went anyway. \"I would like to participate to the stats and the data that Canada needs right now,\" he said. He's one of 550 people who have visited the assessment centres as of Monday afternoon. Though, Koblun doesn't know which list he'll be a part of — \"negative\" or \"positive.\ " He'll have to wait three to five days to learn if he joins the at least 32 others infected with COVID-19 in Hamilton. 
  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced on Monday plans to manufacture and distribute more than one million protective face masks each month in an attempt to protect front-line workers — including police, EMTs, firefighters, as well as healthcare employees in hospitals and clinics — amid the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.   According to an FCA media release, production installations are taking place this week, and the company is set to begin manufacturing the masks in the coming weeks. Masks will be distributed across Canada, Mexico and the U.S. In addition to the support we are giving to increase the production of ventilators, we canvassed our contacts across the healthcare industry and it was very clear that there is an urgent and critical need for face masks,\" said Mike Manley, FCA's CEO, in a media release on Monday. \"We've marshalled the resources of the FCA Group to focus immediately on installing production capacity for making masks and supporting those most in need on the front line of this pandemic.\" VideoCBC Windsor COVID-19 update: Here's what you need to know March 23How auto parts manufacturers could help during the COVID-19 crisis FCA said it will work with officials across all levels of government to \"ensure that the donated face masks are being directed to the people and facilities in the most immediate need.\" FCA's announcement came hours after healthcare and first responder group in Windsor and Essex County called on businesses to donate supplies that can be used by frontline workers responding to COVID-19. Last week, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association said part suppliers could adapt to produce medical supplies to protect against coronavirus.   A spokesperson for FCA has told CBC News the face masks will be produced in China.   
  As the number of cases of COVID-19 increases in New Brunswick, concern within the Indigenous communities across the province grows too. With overcrowding caused by housing shortages, and a population with more medical vulnerabilities, the prospect of a coronavirus outbreak in First Nations communities worries leaders. \"It can take a great strain on us here in our communities because we have two or three families living in a house , so it's hard to isolate people,\" said Elsipogtog council member Ruth Levi. \"We're close-knit families.\" Those concerns have led First Nations communities to take steps to keep the virus out. \"I think the whole world is restless right about this time,\ " Levi said. \"We're making the best of it.\ " \"We're as good and ready as any community can be, I guess, at this point,\" said Levi. Every First Nation has closed its local schools, aligning with the provincial school closures. The Mah-Sos school on the Tobique First Nation is one of many Indigenous community schools now closed to control the spread of novel coronavirus. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) Many communities have also closed non-essential band businesses such as gaming centres, leaving only gas stations, grocery stores and health centres to remain open.   Elsipogtog's River of Fire Market and the St. Mary's Supermarket have decreased their operating hours and put in seniors-only shopping times. Chief Ross Perley of Neqotkuk, also known as Tobique First Nation, said he has been working with the community's health centre to ensure that vulnerable people within the community have the supplies they need to combat the spread of the virus should it reach there. Those supplies include hand sanitizer, gloves, masks and disinfectants. Tobique First Nation Chief Ross Perley says a state of emergency has been declared there. (CBC) \"In terms of preparation, obviously the elderly are the most vulnerable or anyone with a weakened immune system,\ " Perley said. \"The health centre has provided them with some materials in terms of taking precautions and instructions on how to properly disinfect.\" After speaking with Dr. Michael Perley, a physician who works within Tobique and Woodstock First Nations, Perley said his community would be taking more extreme measures to control the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. \"After speaking with Dr. Mike, it's clear to us that it's inevitable the coronavirus will infect our community if we don't take extreme measures,\ " Perley said in a Facebook live video.   Perley placed emphasis on protecting the 135 elders within the community, many of whom have existing health conditions. The community developed a \"check-in procedure\" program, which was to start this week. Local RCMP and tribal security are enforcing overnight curfews and manning checkpoints at the entrance to the community. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC) Following the Assembly of First Nations' declaration of a national state of emergency, Perley said his council voted in favour of declaring a local state of emergency as well. That includes putting into effect a curfew from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. for the entire community. There is also a checkpoint located near the entrance of the community to screen people coming in and out of the reserve. Extra tribal security will also be deployed along with assistance from the local RCMP. Perley said the only non-community members who are permitted to enter are those who are scheduled to be there to service the community, such as mail delivery. Elsipogtog First Nation has also employed a similar checkpoint and curfew.   \"We have started monitoring who comes in and out of the community,\" said Levi.   Ruth Levi, a band councillor at Elsipogtog First Nation, worries what overcrowded living conditions would mean if the virus hit her community. (Gail Harding/CBC) As of today, Elsipogtog security personnel are now mandated to turn away any and all non-essential traffic into the community between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Chief Alan Polchies of Sitansisk, also known as St. Mary's First Nation, said his community's health centre is now able to make referrals directly to the hospital in Fredericton for testing of the COVID-19 virus. Polchies added that his community is doing grocery delivery to community members from the St. Mary's Supermarket to encourage physical distancing.   He said his community is also looking to help with the mental stress involved in this outbreak by working on a program to bring the community back to the land to learn about sacred medicines and practices in small groups.   \"We're going to encourage the families to work on their mental health and do on-the-land based activities,\ " Polchies said. St. Mary's Chief Alan Polchies: ' We are a close knit community, some of our housing is over crowded, but our custom is to gather.' (Jennifer Sweet/CBC) \"We are stewards of the land and this is how we're going to connect to our mental health by our teachings, our songs, our stories, our medicines. \ " Chief Polchies added. Kyana Kingbird of Esgenoôpetitj said communication is important for her role as a community safety planner..   \"One thing to take into account is the fact that this is new for everybody,\ " Kingbird said about dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We've been working closely with EMO. We've also been gathering potential mitigation activities that we could do according to the level of transmission, and right now it's none to minimal.\ " Kingbird said it's important to educate people on what the symptoms are and, if they are showing any signs, to self isolate if possible. Kingbird said overcrowding is an issue, as it is with many First Nations communities across the country.   When we gather, we gather in multiple numbers. So to say you can't gather for more than five people per household, that creates a big issue. Chief Alan Polchies \"That's something that we've also been concerned about and we don't have any clear solutions for that.\" Levi said that in addition to overcrowding because of housing shortages in Elsipogtog, the largest First Nation community in New Brunswick, homelessness is also an issue. Trying to accommodate for those band members may be increasingly difficult. \"So really, it's a lack of resources,\ " Levi said. \"The idea is to isolate them. Sometimes we use the local motel here but they've shut down too.\ " Polchies and Perley also pointed to the housing need and overcrowding as a major issue. \"We are a close-knit community , some of our housing is over crowded, but our custom is to gather,\ " Polchies said. \"When we gather, we gather in multiple numbers. So to say you can't gather for more than five people per household, that creates a big issue.\" \"I applaud the folks in the Parliament that are putting their ministers and their prime minister to task to constantly remind them we're in a new decade , it's 2020, This should not be happening in First Nations communities.\ " The federal government will provide $305 million for a new Indigenous community support fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation communities. Federal response \"We recognize that Indigenous Canadians are faced with greater health vulnerabilities and greater economic challenges than most Canadians at the best of times,\ " Prime Minister Justice Trudeau said  Last week, Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said the formula to access the community support fund would be based on need and population and designed to give First Nations access to funding quickly. \"We're here to mobilize supplies,\ " Miller said. \"We are here to address the vulnerabilities of Indigenous communities, and recognize that we can only do this in close collaboration with Indigenous leadership across this country.\ "
  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states.

That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said. Mask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more actionHome care workers worry about shortage of protective equipment during pandemic: union \"Those are the masks that you want to consider reprocessing. But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Cleaners are fogging parts of the inside of the Saskatoon Correctional Centre with an industrial disinfectant to try to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It's the latest step to stem the spread of the virus in a facility that now has five confirmed cases, all involving staff members. \"At the moment we're just doing the common areas, the gym area,\" said Dennis Slobogian with Skyview Cleaning. The disinfectant compound is branded Vital Oxide and is benign enough to humans that it can be applied without any personal protective gear, he said. \"It's a small machine that blows out a mist maybe two or three feet. You go up against the wall and you kind of wave it up and down, cover the whole area with it,\ " he said. \"It gets into the nooks and crannies and covers the whole surface.\" New offenders arriving at the men's jail also now undergo specific screening for COVID-19 by a nurse, says Noel Busse with the Ministry of Justice. Busse said social distancing is difficult to maintain in a jail, especially when inmates are bunked two to a cell or spend time in a common area like a gymnasium.  ' In for some scary times' as 2 COVID-19 cases linked to Saskatoon Correctional Centre, union says  The jail has suspended personal and professional visits by lawyers, friends and family of inmates. Even with these measures, officers at the Saskatoon jail are apprehensive because the facility has a confined population and confirmed cases, says Bob Bymoen with the Saskatchewan Government and General Employees' Union. \"One of the bigger concerns we hear from corrections officers is the lack of personal protective equipment. Not enough of it,\" he said. Staff do have access to gloves and masks. But Bymoen says it's not clear under what circumstances they should be used. He says it's also not clear whether it's an individual choice, or if someone orders it. \"That's all changing really fast,\ " he said. Busse said personal protective equipment is available to all correctional facility employees based on the level of risk associated with their duties, as recommended by public health authorities and occupational health and safety. Busse says the government won't comment on whether the jail staff who tested positive were located in administrative offices or in a particular unit. It also will not comment on whether the three new cases this week came from staff travelling, or whether the virus was picked up through community transmission. The province does not believe the virus has spread into the jail's general population. \"We have no reason to believe these cases were spread within the correctional facility,\" Busse said. \"However, public health's investigation is still ongoing.\" Bymoen said he wouldn't speculate on whether he believes the virus has been transmitted from staff to the general population. 
  Chinese Canadian organizations have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars across the country to help medical staff treating patients with the novel coronavirus in China, but they're scrambling to find medical supplies they can send. Their supporters began raising funds as soon as news broke that Chinese hospitals in the affected region of Hubei province were running out of basic protective supplies — including masks, gloves, protective body suits and goggles.     Our experience and our reality has been like hunting for water in a desert on a time limit.- Al Lo, Oasis Global Partners A nurse in a protective suit feeds a novel coronavirus patient inside an isolated ward at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, in Wuhan, Hubei province, on Feb. 8. (China Daily via Reuters) But all those items are in limited supply. \"It's very frustrating,\ " said Andi Shi with the Chinese Professionals Association of Canada (CPAC), one of the largest groups to raise donations for supplies. He said the organization could easily raise $500,000, but has stopped accepting large donations. To date it's only managed to find $60,000 worth of supplies.   Turning away donations \"There are people who want to give us money, but we can't accept it because we can't guarantee that we can find enough supplies,\ " he said, adding that a Boston organization, frustrated in their own search, offered CPAC the $100,000 it had raised to date, but CPAC had to turn them down. CPAC did manage to get a shipment of protective body suits to two hospitals in Wuhan, China, last week. This morning, it sent out another shipment of gloves, goggles, medical masks and more suits. They are expected to arrive in a few days to a hospital in Wuhan, but that could be the last for a while, he said.   The first shipment of medical supplies sent by the Chinese Professionals Association of Canada arrived in Wuhan last week. A second shipment left Canada Friday. But that may be the last for a while.   (Submitted by CPAC) ' They will not sell to us' Shi said suppliers have warned the group they could not fill any more orders. \"We are told that they will not sell to us,\" said Shi. \"They want to keep the inventory for Canadian hospitals.\" A spokesperson for one supplier, Medical Pharmacies Group, said each operation makes independent decisions about filling large orders. \"Everyone is managing inventories for their own needs in case of urgent requirements,\" wrote Petra Storm in an email, \"There is no overstock.\ " Shi wonders whether a formal inventory should be taken to make sure Canadian suppliers are doing all they can to help China control what is now feared to be a global epidemic. Al Lo, founder and CEO of Oasis Global Partners, was in Portland on Friday, helping to send off the latest shipment of medical supplies to China. He says he stopped sourcing in Canada a week ago. (Submitted by Al Lo) ' We gave up on Canada' Al Lo, the Canadian CEO and founder of the equity firm Oasis Global Partners, said he stopped looking for supplies in Canada at the beginning of the month.   \"We gave up on Canada given the difficulty we had even sourcing quantities in the U.S., with a market 10 times larger,\" said Lo.  \"Our experience and our reality has been like hunting for water in a desert on a time limit.\" Lo has turned the business of Oasis to sourcing medical supplies full-time because of the crisis. Daniyal Raja with Oasis Global Partners is escorting precious cargo, including medical masks and gloves from Portland. The shipment is small, but CEO Al Lo says it will be the fastest, using Air Canada to Japan, then to Korea before he lands in Shenzhen, China, on Sunday.   (Submitted by Al Lo) He said the supply problem comes with high stakes: \"I would definitely say it's costing lives.\"  Like Shi, Lo said his company has focused on helping medical staff in China, where hospitals in the affected area are reporting having to improvise without effective medical grade supplies.   Should Canada stockpile? On Friday, Lo was in Portland packing up Oasis's fourth shipment, to be escorted by an employee using Air Canada, en route eventually to Shenzhen, China, on Sunday.   Lo said the experience has been eye-opening about the vulnerability of the medical supply chain, and wonders aloud whether Canada and the U.S. are prepared if such an outbreak happened on this continent. Loading up a shipment of medical supplies bound for China courtesy of fundraising by the Chinese Professionals Association of Canada. This donation may be one of the last if more medical supplies can't be found, according to the organization's executive director Andi Shi. (Submitted by CPAC) \"Everyone today, even in the medical field, they expect things to work like Amazon.  They go to their computers, they place an order online and the supplies arrive within days,\" said Lo, \"But this current coronavirus of 2019-2020 is showing that the market will break down.\ " He also suggests that since so much production for medical supplies takes place in China, it could leave Canada vulnerable if it had its own emergency. Perhaps this country should consider formally assessing how much it should stockpile, he says. 
  Masks delivered to health-care workers in Alberta this week are causing headaches and rashes for some, and don't adequately seal to protect workers and patients, nurses say. But the Alberta government says the masks are safe and said calls to nationalize the manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE) are politicizing a crisis. One Calgary nurse, who CBC News has agreed not to identify to protect her employment, said before this week her unit was supplied with procedural masks from Edmonton-based Pri-Med, a company registered with Health Canada that makes medical supplies. But now they've switched to masks from Vanch, a company based in Shenzhen, China, that focuses on radio-frequency identification products but also makes thermometers and masks. CBC Investigates'I was made to feel belittled': Nurses reveal fears working on front lines of COVID-19 pandemicNo, you can't make an N95 mask out of a bra \"[The new masks] have gaps along the side, you can't seal them along your face ... because the mask itself is so big and the loops on the side are so big, the seal on the top of the nose doesn't do anything. You put it on and you smile at your patient and your nose is exposed,\ " the nurse said. \"They don't stay in place, they've got a funky odour and they're causing quite a lot of reactions ... with these ones, my face is actually burning and swollen.\ " She said within about 30 minutes of putting one of the new masks on, she started to feel a burning sensation along the edge of the mask and her airway felt constricted.   I feel like our lives are obviously worth more than that.- Calgary nurse She could only handle wearing the mask for about 90 minutes, and her face stayed swollen and felt like it was burning until the following day. She said colleagues have reported similar issues. She said there are some of the former, Pri-Med masks, available, and those are being prioritized for workers in units with COVID-19 cases and other respiratory illnesses. \"I feel like our lives are obviously worth more than that. And I feel they're putting us at a needless risk when we had the proper masks that were working.... These particular masks are horrible, horrible quality.\" Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Dr. Michael Chatenay, an Edmonton surgeon, said the new masks are of substandard quality, which has him worried about other supplies the province is procuring. \"What's even more concerning is, are the quality of the N95 masks we're going to be getting, are they going to be of the same quality? The 3M masks we're getting are very good.... These are the masks that are really important to protect our lives from this virus.\" Health-care workers have shared similar frustrations on social media, with one poster sharing a video of how easily the new procedural mask slips off their nose. I am currently on shift in ER and the new masks are terrible.

Thanks < a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkenney?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">@jkenney</a> for giving away our quality PPE and risking our safety.&mdash;@DrKU14 I can corroborate these testimonies. The new masks are atrocious and do very little to stop droplets as they do not stay on your face. It is a waste of money.&mdash;@LCampbellMd Susan Slade is vice-president of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, which represents 95,000 workers in the province, about half of whom work in health care. She said a number of workers have shared similar concerns about mask quality. \"People need these masks right now. They need to be able to wear them and they need to be able to feel safe at work,\ " she told CBC News.   \"It doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of masks we can procure.... If they're not of appropriate quality, what's the point?\ " INTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working? INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Sunday She wants to see the government obtain higher quality masks in the short term and to work toward nationalizing medical equipment production. \"The only way we can truly ensure quality control and timely distribution of PPE is if it's manufactured in-house, in Alberta, and overseen by a public body.\" Call to nationalize 'preposterous' Steve Buick, press secretary to provincial Health Minister Tyler Shandro, said all PPE procured by Alberta Health Services is safe and will protect staff and patients. \"The call to nationalize suppliers is preposterous, an example of politicizing the COVID-19 emergency to promote an irrelevant political agenda,\ " he said.   \"AHS is doing a superb job of sourcing PPE. To do so, they're working with new suppliers, and that includes adjusting products to meet their needs and respond to staff concerns.\ " The minister's office said AHS is working on a process to reduce the smell from the procedural masks, and future shipments from the supplier will include corrections to improve fit. Volunteers with Conquer COVID-19 collect donations of PPE in Calgary on Saturday. (Helen Pike/CBC) On April 11 the province announced it had signed contracts valued at more than $200 million for PPE, including for millions of gowns and masks. The same day, the premier said the province would be shipping millions of pieces of excess medical equipment to provinces in need. CBC News spoke to two nurses following that decision, who said while they applauded the province's generosity, they had concerns that as guidelines change to require more frequent changeover of PPE, workers could go through supplies faster than planned. CBC News has agreed not to identify those nurses to protect their employment. Alberta Health Services said on Twitter that it has been sourcing alternative providers of products to ensure PPE continues to be readily available, and said the odour from the new procedural masks has to do with the plastic the masks are shipped in. \"Because regular supply chain for procurement of procedure masks cannot meet the required demand during this response, staff may see ten or more new brands of masks, over the coming weeks. These masks are all safe, certified and meet ASTM Level 1 filtration requirements,\" AHS said.   We continue to distribute millions of procedural masks &amp; other PPE to long term care facilities, pharmacists, first responders, et al. We have ~80 million units being shipped or on order. Plus our Bits &amp ; Pieces Program is stepping up domestic production of PPE &amp; other supplies. <a href=\"https://t.co /ydwhKGdfDd\">pic.twitter.com/ydwhKGdfDd</a>&mdash;@jkenney AHS is also collecting and sterilizing used N95 masks, which provide a better filter and seal than procedural masks, in the event of a shortage. Stories have surfaced internationally about subpar medical supplies arriving from China, and health-care workers across the country have expressed anxieties around PPE shortages.    Canadian officials working around the clock to secure medical supplies, deputy minister says   On Saturday in Calgary, volunteers with national group Conquer COVID-19 were receiving donations of PPE to distribute to front-line workers. Provincial Culture and Status of Women Minister Leela Aheer was there, helping collect donations. She said while the government has made it easier to procure PPE, they're in uncharted territory, and non-profits can help fill gaps that open up. \"To have these organizations come to us and tell us where they're lacking, where the gaps are, it's really helpful for us because then we can figure out what's the best way forward. So I'm very grateful to anybody who responds or gives us feedback or criticism,\ " she said. 
  Even in her last days before COVID-19 overcame her, Arlene Reid was still trying to be positive. \"I'm going to get better,\ " she'd say to her daughter, Adriana Townsend. \"Mommy is going to be OK. I'm going to walk away from this.\ " Instead, Reid died in a bedroom in her daughter's Brampton, Ont., home on Monday, as Townsend frantically performed CPR while waiting for paramedics to arrive. Reid, a 51-year-old personal support worker (PSW), is the third Ontario health-care worker known to have died after contracting COVID-19. Townsend said her mother had no previously diagnosed health conditions. Now, Reid's five children and three grandsons will have to figure out how to go on without a woman the family revered as its rock. \"Seeing my mom take her last breath , that's something I just can't get out of my head,\ " Townsend told CBC News. \"I'm just at a loss.\ " Reid was a PSW with the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) in Peel Region, which would schedule her to work in multiple care facilities or individual client homes. Reid was tested for COVID-19 on April 17 and received word she was positive on April 20, Townsend said, adding that a public health nurse instructed her mother to go home, self-isolate and take Tylenol. Adriana Townsend, left, with her mother, Reid. (Submitted by Antoniette Bryden) Reid was living with two of her daughters and her son — but one of her daughters, Antoniette Bryden, has cancer. Reid didn't want to put her at risk, so she began staying with Townsend. Reid isolated in her home, and Townsend would care for her mother using gloves and a mask. For most of the week that she was there, Reid had a bad cough, shortness of breath and a high fever, her daughter said. In the last couple of days before she died, the cough subsided. \"But her breathing was really bad, and she always complained about having chest pains,\ " Townsend said. Her last breaths Then, just after midnight on Monday, Reid's condition rapidly declined. She said she couldn't breathe and asked her daughter to call 911. That was the moment Townsend knew things weren't going to be OK. \"She just stopped breathing. Her heart stopped,\ " she said. \"I had to pull her off the bed.\ " By the time paramedics got into the room, Townsend was already doing CPR on her mother, trying to bring her back. They worked on her for about 20 minutes, Townsend said, but they couldn't save her. Health-care worker who contracted COVID-19 'gave her life for that place'Ontario's COVID-19 death toll at 1,145, new cases jump to 459 after decline yesterday The paramedics left not long after, she said. \"They just told us we'd have to get someone to get her, like a funeral home to pick her body up,\ " Townsend said. A police officer helped arrange that, but the body wasn't retrieved for another four hours or so. \"The breathing took the best of her,\ " Townsend said. She says she is not displaying any coronavirus symptoms but is now trying to get tested. Union pushes for increased protections SEIU Healthcare, a union that represents workers in long-term care homes, first reported Reid's death on Wednesday. \"The tragic death of our union sister is the second loss of a personal support worker [PSA] in as many weeks as a result of ongoing failures to protect health-care workers during COVID-19,\" SEIU president Sharleen Stewart said in a statement. Another personal support worker from Markham, Ont., died earlier this month. The union said in the statement that PSWs are not being properly protected during the pandemic. \"From Day 1 of this emergency, health and safety protections, PPE protocols and government directives have insufficiently protected PSWs from ongoing threats, whether they work in home care, long-term care or hospitals,\ " Stewart wrote. Jo-Anne Poirier, president and CEO of VON Canada, told CBC News that the safety of staff and clients is \"paramount.\" \"I also want to express my deep condolences to Arlene Reid's family,\" Poirier said.  \"I've been on the phone with them a couple of times today, and I just feel very sad.\ " Reid had been living with two of her daughters and her son in Peel Region, west of Toronto, but then went to stay at Townsend's home, where she self-isolated. (Submitted by Antoniette Bryden) She also said that her company's PSWs are provided with PPE each week, including two surgical masks a day over a five-day period, as well as gloves, gowns and thermometers.   If an employee needs extra PPE, they are instructed to contact their manager so it can be provided, she said, adding that the organization is pushing governments to get as much protective gear as possible. \"With a limited supply we have to make the most strategic use of what we have,\" she said. Gloria Turney, an Ontario health-care worker who grew up with Reid in Jamaica, says she too wants to see more protections for PSWs. \"We go into the unknown every single day. You never know what you're going to face,\ " she said. ' She lost her life taking care of people' In a statement, Ministry of Health spokesperson Hayley Chazan said the health and well-being of Ontarians and health workers is vitally important. \"The outbreaks and deaths due to COVID-19 across the province are tragic, particularly among our front-line health-care workers who put their health and safety at risk to help our most vulnerable,\ " she said. Chazan noted that over 13 million surgical and procedural masks, 200,000 N95 respirator masks, and 38 ventilators have been delivered to Ontario's pandemic stockpile warehouses.   \"Ontario is providing same-day deliveries to hospitals, long-term care and retirement homes, and other facilities to support essential workers in all settings and ensuring supplies and equipment are expedited to those most in need,\ " she said. Now in mourning, Reid's daughters describe their mother as a phenomenal, amazing woman who loved her family, with a vibrant smile that lit up every room she walked into. Daughter Shay-Ann Bryden says the family is now wracked with a host of complicated feelings. \"Of course, we're going to be angry. We've lost our mom,\ " she said. \"But at the same time, she lost her life taking care of people, and it's something that she dedicated her life to doing. So she is a hero, and should be hailed as one.\" adam.carter@cbc.ca
  Some Saskatchewan business owners say they won't be opening next month when the government begins to lift the COVID-19 restrictions. \"This is ridiculous. It's dangerous,\" said Andrew MacDonald, owner of Saskatoon salon Andrew Adan. \"No one 'needs' a colour or a cut or their nails done … No one needs to be on the cover of a mag right now.\" Golf courses and provincial parks will be allowed to begin the process of opening next month. So will hair salons, barber shops, acupuncturists, massage therapists and others who can't maintain physical distancing to perform their service. The province's reopening plan recommends businesses take precautions such as hand washing and donning protective equipment like gloves and masks. Concerns arise following first days of new gathering guidelines in Sask. Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab, said he's been impressed with practices in grocery stores and other outlets which have remained open throughout the restrictions. Shahab said he expects that to continue next month, so businesses will be allowed to make their own safety rules. \"None of this can be policed. I think we all need to have some self-discipline and follow through,\ " Shahab said Tuesday on CBC Radio's The Morning Edition. MacDonald said that's not good enough. He and others say there's no reason to allow such close contact for services that aren't medically necessary. Washing, colouring, cutting and blow drying hair can spread germs, he said. \"Workers have no way of screening adequately in an industry that employs all the same high-contact characteristic activities as a health-care worker,\" he said. Salons and hairdressers have no professional body to regulate them and there are only two provincial government inspectors for the entire province, he said. Even if medical-grade personal protective equipment was available for all salons, MacDonald said he wouldn't want to use this valuable gear when the health system is facing shortages. PM urges Canadians not to drop their guard as officials show progress in COVID-19 fight Some owners of health-related businesses are also concerned. Tara Collins, an audiologist and owner of Saskatoon Hearing and Audiology Clinic, said she'd like more guidance from the government. She'd also like help sourcing proper equipment. After countless phone calls, she's been unable to secure an adequate supply of masks, disinfectants and sanitizers. She said she likely won't be opening as permitted next month. \"I'm trying to find alternatives. Everyone's waiting,\ " Collins said. \"Am I putting myself at a disadvantage as a business person by not opening? Maybe. But I want everyone to be safe.\"
  The Trump administration's attempt to pressure Minnesota-based 3M from exporting life-saving masks to Canada is \"extremely disappointing\" and flies in the face of decades of cooperation, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Friday. \"If I had the chance to speak to president Trump, I would remind him of Canadian solidarity following 9/11 and in the global fight against terrorism,\" Kenney said. \"We have made very real sacrifices to stand by our American friends and allies and, as a Canadian, I am insulted by the decision announced today. \"[This is] critically needed medical equipment that we need to fight the pandemic here in this country.\" Premier Jason Kenney said he was \"insulted\" by the Trump administration's order to stop exporting life-saving masks. 0:41 In a news release issued Friday, 3M said it was facing pressure from the White House to sell medical respirators and masks in the United States before exporting them to other countries, including Canada.   3M faces pressure from Trump order to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada Fight over N95 masks shows Trump testing ethical, legal limits in COVID-19 crisis   \"I think it's shortsighted, because the United States is a net importer of this kind of equipment,\ " Kenney said. \"It also underscores why we must produce our own critical equipment here at home, because apparently we can't even count on our closest friend and ally to be a supplier.\" Kenney voiced his support for Ontario Premier Doug Ford's call for manufacturing companies to produce medical items in short supply, saying Alberta would push to follow suit. \"We need to ensure we have surplus equipment, but we will not respond the same way the U.S. president has today. It's very disappointing,\" he said. \"I would remind our American friends and neighbours that we've always been there together in important moments in history. \"We should be there together at this important moment in history.\ " Masks not yet recommended in Alberta, Hinshaw says Trump announced new federal guidelines Friday recommending Americans wear face coverings while in public, but Alberta has not adopted that as a recommendation. \"I have asked our scientific team to look at this,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, at Friday's news conference. \"I hope to have a formal recommendation by next week.\ " There is evidence that masks can limit the spread of infection from those who are infected to others, Hinshaw said, but there are problems with cloth masks. \"When cloth masks get damp  … they can actually start to trap virus, and that could be a risk for the person wearing them,\ " she said.   B.C. health officials said Wednesday that they were considering implementing widespread use of face masks as COVID-19 cases rose in the province. On Friday, Trump said the wearing of masks in America was voluntary, and added he was unlikely to wear one himself. 
  The demand for hand sanitizer and face masks has left all the Shoppers Drug Mart locations in Winnipeg, among many other stores, out of stock. While no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Manitoba, customers are flooding the stores in search of precautionary measures during the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus. \"My understanding  … is that there have been some shortages when it comes to things like facial masks and hand sanitizer,\ " provincial Health Minister Cameron Friesen​​​​​ said during a Tuesday press conference. Many Walmart locations across the city are also sold out of face masks, and those with stock of hand sanitizer are limiting quantities to one or two bottles per customer.   With high demand for masks and alcohol-based sanitizers online, classified ads have popped up on Kijiji, advertising inflated prices for the products.   Some ads are asking upwards of $150 for 10 face masks.    Ads on Kijiji provide sellers with products unavailable at stores for a heavy premium. (CBC) CBC reached out to the posters of several of the ads, all of whom declined to comment.   Licensed pharmacist Ryan Chan, though, urges Manitobans not to race to stores — but to simply continue washing their hands thoroughly.   Hand-washing is still one of the best ways to prevent the spread of viruses, he says. While hand sanitizers are a good supplement, \"the flow of running water actually removes the virus from your hands,\" said Chan. As for face masks, a statement to CBC from the provincial Department of Health said public health officials are not recommending the use of masks in public places, saying there is little evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus.   Licensed pharmacist Ryan Chan urges Manitobans to wash their hands to help curb the spread of viruses. (Warren Kay/CBC) Chan says those who are healthy and choose to wear a mask need to be cautious about touching their face. \"A lot of time you get [a virus] from your hands touching your face. Face masks should be worn if you're actually infected,\ " he said.   Don't panic, don't stockpile food, Manitoba health minister urges as coronavirus fears ramp upSeveral Winnipeg medical supply stores sold out of face masks During question period at the legislature Wednesday, the health minister assured Manitobans that the risk of coronavirus remains low in the province.   Friesen also said the government is taking all the necessary measures in response to the virus should it appear in the province. Manitoba's health facilities are being monitored by Public Health Manitoba to ensure that personal protective equipment is available in health professionals and patients that need it. 
  Health officials say there are enough protective face masks for health-care workers in the Northwest Territories to last \"several weeks,\" but they are bracing for the increased demand that would come with an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the territory. Known as N95 masks, the white paper masks are a key piece of protective equipment for doctors and nurses working on patients with the novel coronavirus. They filter out the microdroplets that transmit the highly contagious virus when someone with it sneezes, coughs or even speaks. There is a North America-wide shortage of N95 masks. On Saturday, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer authorized the use of a framework adopted in British Columbia last month to decide who gets masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) when it is in short supply during a pandemic. Dr. Kami Kandola also authorized the Department of Health to go to the fourth of six stages of prioritization in the framework. Jurisdictions move to the fourth stage when they are within days of running out of one or more items of PPE. \"We are not actually implementing at Stage 4,\ " Dr. Sarah Cook, the medical director for the N.W.T. Health and Social Services Authority, told reporters at a briefing Wednesday. \"Dr. Kandola authorized that we could implement Stage 4. That doesn't mean we are or have to implement at Stage 4.\ " As N.W.T. prepares for next phase of COVID-19, medical director says physical distancing still keyRunny nose? Cough? You too can get a COVID-19 test in the N.W.T. Kandola said she authorized the use of the B.C. framework and authorized the health authority to enter Stage 4 in order to be ready to act if need be. \"It's always been a proactive approach,\ " she said. \"I don't wait for a situation to deteriorate.\" Limiting use of masks Cook said there are enough masks to last \"several weeks\" at the current rate of usage, also known as the \"burn rate.\ " Dr. Sarah Cook said officials are trying to find new sources of N95 masks in case COVID-19 cases go up in the territory. (Caitlin Cleveland photo/GNWT) She said health authorities are now in the process of implementing continuous masking, which saves doctors and nurses from having to put on a new mask each time they see a new patient. But not all people treating patients are using N95 masks. \"Because we don't have community transmission yet and we are trying to preserve PPE for when we do need it, we're not at a stage of providing PPE for everyone who is providing care within two metres,\" said Cook. N95 masks are being used by doctors and nurses performing procedures known to generate microdroplets, such as inserting a tube in a patient's mouth and throat during surgery, or using an inflating bag and a mask to help someone who is having trouble breathing. Meanwhile, surgical masks — a looser-fitting mask that helps block large-particle droplets or splashes — are being used when treating patients with risk of COVID-19, and for other normal medical procedures such as surgeries, explained the health authority in a subsequent email Thursday. \"If we have community spread and we need to go to continuous masking for anyone within two metres of a patient, that's going to change the burn rate,\" said Cook. The health authority added in an email Thursday that continuous masking is currently being implemented in two settings — with long-term care and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Reprocessed masks in wide use in U.S.: medial director Cook said officials are trying to find new sources of the masks in anticipation of an increase in the number of cases. Doctors and nurses have not yet been asked to reuse their single-use masks. Cook said they may be asked to use recycled masks. \"We're actively looking at that as an option, but it's not in place at this time,\ " she said. Alberta Health Services collecting, cleaning used N95 masks for possible reuseSask. researchers say they successfully decontaminated test run of N95 masks for reuse Asked if recycled masks are as effective as new N95 masks in screening out microdroplets, Cook and Kandola would say only that \"they're safe\" to use. \"That's a very technical question,\" said Cook. \"The information I've been given is it is safe to use if it's gone through the appropriate reprocessing process.\ " Kandola said reprocessed masks are in wide use in areas of the U.S. where supplies of the masks are low. 
  Automakers are reopening factories in China that were idled by concerns over spread of the coronavirus as they try to reverse a sales slump in their biggest market. Local officials have orders from the ruling Communist Party to get businesses functioning again, while still enforcing anti-disease curbs that shut down much of the world's second-largest economy. \"Local governments are putting their full weight behind helping businesses open,\ " the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Ker Gibbs, said in a statement. Toyota Motor Co. said two factories reopened Monday with one of the usual two daily shifts working. Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., Mercedes Benz and Chinese brand Geely resumed some operations last week. General Motors Co. said a \"staggered start\" across its factories began Saturday. Nissan Motor Co. plans to restart this week. Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor plans to suspend work at one of its plants in Ulsan, South Korea, this week because of a possible coronavirus infection. Don't come to work if you've been to Wuhan Automakers say they are checking employees for the coronavirus's telltale fever, barring visitors and telling employees to stay home if they have been in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, or other areas that have imposed travel curbs. The outbreak prompted the government to extend the Lunar New Year holiday to keep factories and offices closed and workers at home. People wear face masks and goggles in Beijing on Feb. 15. After extending the Lunar New Year holiday, the government wants everyone to return to work, but not if they've been to Wuhan. (Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press) The government has told employees who can work from home to stay there, but China's vast manufacturing industries that supply the world with smartphones, toys and other goods need workers in factories. Obstacles include a requirement for workers who return from other areas — as millions are doing after the holiday — to make sure they are illness-free by staying at home for its 14-day incubation period. Affecting global supply chains \"Most factories have a severe shortage of workers, even after they are allowed to open,\" said Gibbs. \"This is going to have a severe impact on global supply chains that is only beginning to show up.\ " Automakers are under pressure to reverse a two-year-old sales decline in a Chinese market they hope will propel global revenue. Sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans hit an annual peak of 24.7 million in 2017 and have declined since then. Last year's sales tumbled 9.6 per cent to 21.4 million. WHO says China taking 'extraordinary measures' in response to coronavirus outbreakAs Canadians return home from Westerdam cruise, health officials urge them to self-isolate The coronavirus \"adds to the challenges that the sector is already facing,\" said Fitch Ratings in a report.

AnalysisThe longer and deeper the COVID-19 crisis, the harder it will be to bounce back: Don Pittis GM, Toyota and others said the pace of production depends on how fast they can restart the flow of components from thousands of Chinese suppliers that also shut down. That disruption could have global repercussions: UBS estimates China supplies eight per cent of auto parts exports worldwide. 
  A team of more than two dozen people is testing and tracing residents on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Dr. Patricia Daly, Vancouver Coastal Health's chief medical health officer, said Tuesday that the testing rate is over 40 people per 1,000, more than double the rate in other regions, and only a small number of cases have been found. \"It's almost like detective work,\ " Daly said. \"You have to do a lot of interviewing and follow-up with cases, but we have staff who are very good at this.\ " The Downtown Eastside is one of the areas where health officials have concerns because other cities have seen outbreaks where people live in communal settings and the virus can easily spread, she said. A man wearing a protective mask walks on the Downtown Eastside.   (Ben Nelms/CBC) Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said people living in the area may also have several underlying health issues that would make them more at risk of having a severe infection. Vancouver Coastal Health is implementing a three-pillar approach for prevention, testing and tracing along with support to reduce the impacts on inner-city neighbourhoods of the opioid overdose crisis and the pandemic. Daly said the team proactively offers testing to anybody who might have symptoms and doesn't wait for them to come to the clinic, she said. \"We have a very low threshold for testing.\ " Tracing contacts Testing and tracing have been ongoing for a number of weeks and confirmed cases of COVID-19 or potentially exposed contacts are followed-up daily by a public-health team, she said. If someone on the team identifies a person who is positive for COVID-19, she said health officials try to trace all the close contacts. \"So, the first thing we do is interview the case. We find out where they've been in the period of time when they would have been contagious to other people, that's from the start of the symptoms going back two days.\ " If all the contacts of that person can't be traced, she said health officials put out a news release. \"Early on in the pandemic, we had a case of a person who attended a dental conference in Vancouver and that case had a lot of people at the conference, so we put out a news release,\ " Daly said. Health officials also put out a news release if they can't identify the individual or if there is an outbreak that the public should be aware of, such as at the Vancouver poultry plant where 34 cases have been linked, she said. Workers at 2 more B.C. poultry-processing plants test positive for COVID-19 If a person from the Downtown Eastside tests positive for COVID-19 and does not have adequate housing, he or she is offered a room in a hotel and monitored by public health officials, Daly said. Mayor Kennedy Stewart had said BC Housing has secured hundreds of hotel rooms in Vancouver for people who are homeless or precariously housed and who need to self-isolate. Contacts the person may have had are usually traced through interviews, she said. \"We can go to the building to find out who they shared a washroom with ... so it's working with the case but also working with others in the community.\ "
  A doctor working in intensive care in Edmonton is warning serious COVID-19 cases may not be who you would expect. Dr. Raiyan Chowdhury is a critical care specialist who does work at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton. In a phone interview Wednesday, he described what he's seeing from the front lines of the pandemic. Chowdhury said the biggest surprise is people in their 30s needing hospitalization from the illness. \"We've certainly had older people, but we've also had younger people as well,\" he said. Otherwise healthy individuals without any pre-existing conditions are being hospitalized; for many, it's their first time in the health-care system. \"It's not the people that you would normally think,\ " he said. \"Younger people may be hospitalized by this or you don't necessarily have to have any pre-existing condition to deteriorate.\"  'An amazing man' : Young father identified as northern Alberta's 1st fatal case of COVID-19 Alberta sees two more COVID-19 deaths, 117 new cases   According to the Wednesday COVID-19 update from the province, there have been 62 hospitalizations in total with 20 admissions to intensive care units. Alberta Health shared statistics Thursday showing there have been 10 hospitalizations — including one ICU admission — for people between the ages of 20 and 44. Another 13 hospitalizations have been for people aged 45 to 54.   Of the 871 cases confirmed to date in the province, 142 have recovered and 11 have died, including a 34-year-old man from northern Alberta. Chowdhury said the other factor that has surprised him is the speed of decline in some patients, even within the span of a single day. \"There's been people that we've seen in [emergency] that come in on a few litres of oxygen and then by the end of the day have really accelerated how much oxygen they're requiring to the point where they could need a ventilator.\" Dr. Raiyan Chowdhury is a critical care medicine specialist at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. (Codie McLachlan/CBC) However, Chowdhury said he is optimistic that preparations and necessary planning is in place from all quarters — nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and others.   Alberta hospitals prepare for COVID-19 influx 'that will certainly test our capacity'  \"It 's basically all hands on deck and we're happy to see that,\ " he said. The general conversation around the intensive care unit is that health-care workers currently are equipped with the skills and equipment — including ventilators — to see people through the crisis, he said. But, he added, if they have a problem that's restricted to just their lungs.\" Chowdhury says what worries doctors most is the risk of organ failure for people with pre-existing conditions, like heart, kidney or lung issues.   \"Once that happens, it becomes very difficult for us to be able to get people through this.\" Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, continues to encourage Albertans to work together to help stop the spread of the virus by practising physical distancing, washing hands regularly for at least 20 seconds and avoiding face-touching. Completely changed To prepare for the coming surge, Chowdhury said the Royal Alexandra Hospital has completely changed many of its protocols.   \"Coming into the hospital, now you have to get screened for symptoms and hopefully a temperature check before you're allowed in,\" he said. Chowdhury said he wants to see health-care workers wear face masks at all times and advocates for the use of regular face masks — not the specialty N95 respirator mask — by the general public. \"Some may call it an overreaction but I feel like if we act now, you stay ahead of the curve.\" Pandemic preparations have also changed how doctors interact with the families of patients. In the ICU, they're used to talking to family members on a daily basis at the bedside of their loved ones, Chowdhury said. \"All of that now is out the door in order to limit how easily this thing could spread if it does come into the hospital,\" he said. Limitations have been put in place, including one visitor to one patient at a time. \"I do think that's the right approach,\ " Chowdhury said. \"We can't tell if the visitor is sick, we don't know they may be an asymptomatic case, so we do have to take incredible caution.\" Technology, including the use of programs like FaceTime, is also helping keep people connected, he said. The problem is worse for families of patients unable to communicate because of intubation. Chowdhury said he has given out his cellphone to one patient's family member to give regular updates. \"We've got to think outside of the box in medicine to help these people in this difficult time.\"
  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.

For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask? Your COVID-19 questions answeredMask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more action There also is limited evidence that healthy people wearing masks reduces the community spread of diseases, like COVID-19, as public health officials have been saying, but some acknowledge that's partly because studies haven't been done. A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places. CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisisYour guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada The researchers also said that for cultural reasons, masks are considered a hygienic practice even for healthy people in Asia, while in North America it's considered something only sick people do. Children wear masks at the Hong Kong West Kowloon High Speed Train Station, in Hong Kong on Jan. 23. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking public transit or staying in crowded places. (Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

Medical experts say there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are avoiding contact with other people as they're supposed to be. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  Two employees at the National Microbiology Laboratory and one of their close contacts have tested positive for the coronavirus, staff at the Winnipeg facility were told via email on Thursday. The three are now in isolation, lab executive director Steven Guercio said in the email, which was obtained by CBC News. \"Manitoba Health has initiated contact tracing,\" Guercio said, referring to the practice of finding out everyone an infected person could have contacted prior to their test. \"As a proactive measure, Facility Occupational Health and Safety has initiated a risk assessment and will ask potential at-risk contacts to isolate at home pending full contact tracing by Manitoba Health,\ " Guercio added. \"Close contacts identified through contact tracing will receive direction from MB Health on testing and isolation requirements.\" Guercio also told staff the lab's management \"understands that this news will create concern,\" and advised them to contact employee assistance if needed. All staff were also instructed to wash their hands on their way out of the building. Close contacts tested Guercio's office deferred comment to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which is responsible for the microbiology lab. A Manitoba Shared Health spokesperson did the same, adding the province only comments on infections when there is a public health concern. A PHAC spokesperson said all procedures for cleaning and disinfection of work areas and common spaces have been followed. Employees continue to practise effective public health measures, including physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory etiquette, Eric Morrissette said in an email statement. \"It is not unexpected that we would see cases amongst our workforce as COVID-19 infection is circulating in our community,\" he said. PHAC has contingency plans to make sure the lab's essential operations can continue, even with sick or absent employees, and employees who have asked to work from home — and who are able to do their duties remotely — are doing so. \"We wish our employees a speedy recovery and are thinking of them and their families during this difficult time,\" Morrisette said. The head of the union representing scientists and researchers doesn't know if any of the infected people are her members, but Debi Daviau said she's been told at least one is a lab worker.   Daviau, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, said Health Canada has done contact tracing on all three — any close contacts were tested and sent home, and are expected to get their test results tonight or tomorrow. Non-close contacts were asked to stay at work for now but they were also tested. If they are positive, they will be sent home for self-quarantine. Research includes coronavirus Work at the lab includes research on SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Researchers are trying to find an appropriate animal model for research as they work on a vaccine and treatment for the respiratory illness, Daviau said. They are also doing research on how to sterilize N95 masks for reuse. \"They are working around the clock. Their work is critical. They are working with the virus, so the potential for exposure is high,\ " she said. \"These members are some of Canada's unsung heroes.\" The NML had arranged for a drive-thru testing site at the lab for staff and their families, Daviau said, adding PHAC is handling the situation well. \"PHAC responded rapidly, and fortunately, due to onsite infectious disease experts, they've implemented responsive testing, tracing and isolation measures. We appreciate the urgent action and support for the safety of the employees at the site,\" she said.

Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask? Your COVID-19 questions answeredMask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more action There also is limited evidence that healthy people wearing masks reduces the community spread of diseases, like COVID-19, as public health officials have been saying, but some acknowledge that's partly because studies haven't been done. A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

Medical experts say there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are avoiding contact with other people as they're supposed to be. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03

INTERACTIVE | See the latest data on COVID-19 cases in Canada.   Eligible Canadians who lost income because of COVID-19 could start applying Monday for a new emergency benefit program as the government tries to keep people afloat during a pandemic that has claimed thousands of lives worldwide and prompted a frantic scramble to secure critical supplies.   Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said in a statement that delays in global shipments and restrictions at the U.S. border have \"severely strained Ontario's inventory\" and left Canada's most populous province with \"roughly a one-week supply\" of critical personal protective equipment (PPE). He told reporters Monday that Ontario has a current order for about four million masks from the U.S. and that only half a million have been released. \"We know the U.S. isn't allowing supplies across the border,\ " Ford said. \"Getting supplies from other countries is increasingly difficult.\" WATCH | Ford talks about tight supplies in Ontario : Though supplies are running low, Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he's optimistic the disagreement with the U.S. over protective medical equipment will be resolved. 2:37 Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is in constant contact with the provinces about PPE and other important supplies. The government is also in talks with the U.S., he said, and has reiterated that critical supplies flow both ways across the border.   How will the global coronavirus pandemic end? Meet the public health detectives working around-the-clock to stop the spread of COVID-19   Monday evening, 3M, the company at the centre of the dispute between the U.S. and Canada, released a statement saying it had struck a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to supply N95 masks to other countries, including Canada.   \"As the pandemic unfolds in different stages around the world,\" the company said in a statement, \"3M will continue to work with governments to direct respirators and other supplies to serve areas most in need.\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called the flow of medical-related supplies across the border \"very\" reciprocal, adding that members of the government had \"positive\" conversations with U.S. counterparts over the weekend. \"Both countries benefit from this and both countries would lose out if hurdles were to be put in the way of that flow of health-care support between our two countries,\" she said Monday.   CBC News reported Monday that Ontario hospitals have received more than 600 extra ventilators to help treat COVID-19 patients. During his daily news conference, Trudeau spoke at length about the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB), which opened to applications early Monday morning to people born in January, February and March.  The system, run through the Canada Revenue Agency, staggers the application window for people born in later months as the week goes on. The employment minister's office said by late Monday afternoon, 642,000 applications had been submitted for the benefit.   WATCH | Trudeau says more Canadians will be able to access emergency benefits: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the government is looking at ways to extend COVID-19 emergency benefits to students and those working reduced hours due to the pandemic. 1:46 The emergency funding program, which offers eligible applicants $2,000 a month for a period of up to four months, is just one of the measures the Canadian government has launched to try and buoy families and businesses feeling the fallout from the virus, which has to date resulted in nearly 1.3 million reported cases around the world. Applications are now open for the Canada emergency response benefit. (CBC) Trudeau said his government knows not everyone is getting the help they need through CERB and other programs. He said in the days ahead, the government will announce additional measures aimed at helping gig workers, contract workers, and workers who are getting 10 or fewer hours per week. What those measures would be and how they would work was not immediately clear. The prime minister also talked about measures to help post-secondary students who can't find summer jobs and workers who are still on the job but earning less than they would if they were on the CERB. There were no details on those programs, either. \"There are some people who don't yet qualify who we need to help,\" PM says. He says people working less than 10 hours a week will soon qualify for CERB. Or people who are working but are making less than the benefit - the gov't will help them too.&mdash;@JPTasker The prime minister thanked people performing critical services in the health care, trucking and food sectors, but urged people who don't need to be out to stay home.   \"What the next weeks and months look like depends on you,\" Trudeau said, urging people to take actions to protect the vulnerable and keep the health-care system from being overwhelmed. Earlier Monday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he couldn't agree more with the government's decision to move forward with a \"Team Canada\" approach to the outbreak — and said Conservatives have been part of that approach since \"Day 1\" of the crisis.    How to help seniors get through the COVID-19 pandemic   Scheer focused his remarks on the charitable sector, saying that while need is soaring, donations have \"dramatically declined.\" He said Conservatives want the government to temporarily increase the tax credit for charitable giving in 2020, and remove the capital gains tax on charitable donations of private company shares and real estate. He also called on the government to release its coronavirus projections and modelling, as well as further details around how it plans to meet needs for critical medical equipment. According to a database maintained by Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University, nearly 73,000 people have died as a result of the virus, which was first reported in China's Hubei province in late 2019. The United States reached a grim milestone today, surpassing 10,000 deaths. The true number of COVID-19 cases is certainly much higher due to limited testing, different ways nations count the dead and deliberate under-reporting by some governments. At least 16,667 of the cases are confirmed in Canada, with cases recorded in every province and territory except Nunavut. As of 8:00 p.m. ET on Monday, CBC News has counted a total of 359 deaths in Canada related to COVID-19. The provinces and territories which offer information on people who have recovered listed 3,629 cases as resolved. Public health officials have cautioned that the numbers, which don't include the deaths of two Canadians abroad, don't provide a full picture of the outbreak, as they fail to capture cases that haven't been tested or are still under investigation. The vast majority of infected people recover from the virus, formally known as SARS CoV-2, which is spread by microscopic droplets from coughs or sneezes. Chief public health officer weighs in on masks The role masks can play to slow the spread of the disease has been contentious, with some countries requiring people to wear masks when out in public. The U.S. recently announced guidelines recommending people cover their faces while in public, though the president noted he wouldn't be following the recommendation. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, on Monday said masks can be used to protect others when out in public, though she noted that they have not been proven to protect the person wearing the mask from infection.   Tam — who had in the past said masks aren't necessary for people without symptoms — said the change from previous advice is due to increasing evidence that people with the virus can spread it without knowing they're sick. \"Now that more countries have had larger numbers of cases and have analyzed transmission patterns , it is clear that transmission of the virus is happening more often than previously recognized from infected people right before they develop symptoms.\ "  Read more about what Dr. Theresa Tam said about masks and what that means for Canadians from CBC's John Paul Tasker. ANALYSIS | Outbreak of 'mask wars' risks setback for war against coronavirus   On top of that pre-symptomatic transmission, there is also evidence that some people who never show symptoms are able to transmit the virus. Given the \"emerging information\" around asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, Tam said the special advisory committee on COVID-19 had come to a consensus that \"wearing a non-medical mask, even if you have no symptoms, is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain.\ " WATCH | Dr. Tam's updated advice about wearing non-medical masks:   Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam spoke with reporters on Parliament Hill on Monday 2:21 Tam reiterated that medical masks are needed for front-line health workers as the country is in a \"critical stage\" of the COVID-19 pandemic. For most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause pneumonia and death. The Public Health Agency of Canada says risk varies between communities but notes that the illness poses a serious health threat to Canadians and pegs the risk level as high. Via Rail extends service suspensions Via Rail is extending the suspension of its passenger rail service from Toronto to British Columbia.

That milestone comes after a day of conflicting signs in the country's battle against the novel coronavirus, and debate on what to do next. In what seemed to be good news, New York — the hardest-hit state — on Monday saw a death toll that was \"effectively flat\" for the second day in a row. At a news conference, Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed cautious optimism in the daily increase of new hospitalizations (358) and new admissions into intensive care (128).   At the same time, physician and member of the White House coronavirus task force Brett Giroir said that Americans can expect this week to be \"peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week.\" Members of the media tour a field hospital set up for COVID-19 patients at the Ernest N.

Coronavirus-related fatalities and recorded infections continued to drop on Monday in Spain, although authorities warned of possible distortions by a slower reporting of figures over the weekend. The country's health ministry reported 637 new deaths for the previous 24 hours, the lowest fatality toll in 13 days, for a total of over 13,000 since the pandemic hit the country. New recorded infections were also the lowest in two weeks: 4,273, bringing the total of confirmed cases over 135,000.

A COVID-19 glossary: What the terms mean and some subtle differences
  An infectious disease specialist with the Nova Scotia Health Authority says they're ready to deal with the coronavirus if it ends up on our doorstep, but the risk remains low. So far, just one person in the province has been tested for the virus, and the result was negative. \"People in Nova Scotia are more at risk for normal human viruses than they are for this particular virus,\" said Dr. Todd Hatchette, the service chief of microbiology. He noted that since December, there have been 70 cases of the flu in Nova Scotia, but only three cases of coronavirus in Canada. Hatchette said there's a lot of misinformation being spead about the coronavirus and some people wrongly believe there have been a lot more cases in Canada. Medical staff arrive with a patient at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 25, 2020. (Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images) Hatchette said the same basic hygiene practices will protect you from both viruses, such as regularly washing your hands and coughing in your sleeve. He said if there are more suspected cases of coronavirus, the samples will be tested in his lab and then sent to the national lab in Winnipeg. Hatchette said they're constantly keeping staff in the loop about best practices as concern grows around the world. On the ground, health-care workers are asking patients about travel up front, so they can quickly identify people who have been in the regions of China that have been affected by the outbreak. \"If someone says that they've been to an area in China that is at risk, they're asked to put on a mask so that they prevent transmission to anybody in the room and are then seen quite quickly,\ " he said.

Hatchette said if anyone who has travelled to those zones is back home and symptomatic, they should call public health, which will have clear instructions for next steps. Hatchette noted the virus has only been identified for about three weeks, and so their understanding of it is evolving quickly. He emphasizes it is spread through droplets  — it's not airborne. \"The fear of the unknown is what what makes people anxious, but at this point, it seems like it's being transmitted like any usual human respiratory virus,\ " he said. Health Minister Randy Delorey says there's a lot of national conversations among health experts to keep each province up to date on the coronavirus. (CBC) Health Minister Randy Delorey is also emphasizing the risk level in Nova Scotia is low. He said health officials are sharing information on a national level. Like Hatchette, Delorey said people need to remember basic hygiene practices that help during flu season. \"Frequent washing your hands, sanitizing door knobs, things like that,\" he said. \"Coughing in your sleeve, staying home when you're sick. That applies to this particular virus.\" Hatchette is confident Nova Scotia's health-care system is prepared if any cases are diagnosed in the province. \"We can deal with it quickly and make sure that the person who is sick is taken care of appropriately and the workers that are helping them are protected,\" he said.

  All staff and visitors at Ontario correctional institutions are now required to wear masks in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. The personal protective equipment was made mandatory at all times Wednesday, according to a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Solicitor General. \"We have also rolled out temperature checks for all staff and visitors,\" added Kristy Denette, explaining that measure was implemented at facilities across the province earlier this week. \"Inmates get temperature checks on admission and as appropriate during their incarceration,\ " she added. Correctional officers at the Niagara Detention Centre were told they would be supplied with masks when entering the building as of 10 a.m., said Mark Mrmak, president of OPSEU Local 252. The new measure comes after the Ministry of Labour sent an inspector to the Thorold facility last week because several officers refused to search inmate dormitories without masks. Niagara Detention Centre staff want masks to protect themselves, inmates from COVID-19 More than 2,000 inmates released, 6 COVID-19 cases confirmed inside Ontario jails Mrmak previously told CBC the centre had surgical masks in stock and that wearing one had not been a problem before the pandemic. The virus is even more of a reason for correctional officers to wear masks in order to protect both staff and inmates, he argued. \"Essentially you're walking into a room that's full of inmates and they're free to roam … and you're pretty much walking all among them,\ " he said at the time.  \"Social distancing, that doesn't exist.\" Worries about protective gear and masks in particular were shared by employees at correctional facilities across the province, said Mrmak Wednesday, adding he was happy to see the government taking them seriously. \"It actually feels like someone was listening to us and took our concerns and addressed them. I hope our members do feel proud.\" The union president was one of the people charged with distributing masks this morning and said while staff appeared shocked they got what they wanted, they were pleased with the extra level of protection. \"I took pride in handing these things out and it seemed staff were appreciative,\" he said. More protection for everyone inside Standard surgical masks will now be used in all areas unless an N95 mask is deemed necessary. There haven't been any cases of the novel coronavius at the jail yet, and Mrmak said he's hoping the masks his members fought for help keep it that way. \"The whole purpose of this really was about staying safe and protecting  … not only the staff but all the inmates in the institution,\ " he said.  \"We believe we achieved more safety and more protection for everyone inside those walls.\"
  Amid the global coronavirus outbreak, masks have been flying off shelves in cities across the country and viral videos are sparking concern over paramedics spotted in protective gear. In one recent instance, video footage from a flight from China to Toronto showed Peel paramedics decked out in various types of masks — including one wearing a full clear-plastic face cover — while transporting a patient off the flight. The footage got thousands of views and shares after being re-posted by different accounts, and prompted plenty of speculation over the patient having coronavirus. But Brad Bowie, the community relations officer for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, says it wasn't a suspected coronavirus case at all, though the video was indeed showing paramedics taking standard precautions. So what's the real purpose of personal protective equipment for paramedics? And what does it have to do with the virus that's spreading to countries around the world? CBC Toronto spoke to experts like Bowie to break it all down: When do paramedics wear protective gear? Anytime their own health could be at risk, paramedics don protective gear, says Bowie. That means if a patient is coughing, sneezing, or bleeding profusely — when airborne droplets or bodily fluids are flowing  — it's time to suit up. Sometimes that decision happens on-site, but there's also pre-screening in place so paramedics know what they're getting in to. Paramedics have various types of masks to choose from. Sometimes this full face protection is required if first responders can't wear other types of masks due to their facial shape or even facial hair. (Paul Borkwood/CBC News) Dineen Robinson, a spokesperson for Toronto Paramedic Services, says its communications centre screens for a \"range of emerging infectious diseases\" when patients call with respiratory or gastrointestinal issues and have recently travelled outside of Canada. \"Any such information that is obtained from callers is then communicated to frontline staff attending those calls for emergency service,\ " she says. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the province has also implemented \"enhanced screening measures\" at all emergency medical services' communication centres to identify potential cases before dispatching paramedics, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health in Ontario, recently said. What protective gear is available? Bowie says there's a whole slate of personal protective equipment, or PPE, available to paramedics. Gloves are an everyday staple worn on all calls, he says. There are also face shields to protect paramedics from airborne droplets, and a variety of masks. Canada negotiates details of airlift as WHO declares global health emergency over coronavirus Gowns are also available, and in rare cases paramedics will resort to full-body covering — but that's usually just for extreme cases of infectious, potentially-deadly diseases. Why so many different masks? Generally, paramedics will put on a disposable N-95 respirator mask; they're usually white, sometimes duck-bill shaped, and loop around the back of your head. It's a simple way to protect someone from breathing in 95 per cent of all airborne particles, be it droplets from a patient coughing or dangerous dust or mould. Paramedics don personal protective equipment for a variety of potential illnesses, not just the new coronavirus. (Paul Borkwood/CBC News) But Bowie says the style doesn't work for all paramedics, who are regularly fit-tested to make sure they've got a mask that protects them. At times, some people need different styles of mask to accommodate certain facial sizes or structures, skin reactions, or even facial hair like a beard. ' The fear is the same' — lessons learned from past pandemics applied to coronavirus Those paramedics might need to upgrade to other styles, including a full face shield that has a tube to filter in clean air. If you see the gear, does that mean the patient has coronavirus? It's possible, but probably not. Bowie says protective gear is a precaution for a variety of medical issues, including the new coronavirus. But it's definitely not a clear indication of the type or severity of a patient's illness  — it's just a way for paramedics to protect themselves and their loved ones from getting sick. Infectious disease expert Dr. Allison McGeer tells The National about the spread of coronavirus and if masks really help. 1:49 \"We're going to wear that gear for any respiratory disease ... someone who's got a bit of a temperature, a cough,\" Bowie explains. Canada's chief public health officer condemns racist acts linked to coronavirus outbreak The equipment and guidelines \"are not new to our staff and are part of normal practice,\ " echoes Robinson, speaking for Toronto Paramedic Services. \"These are the same precautions that frontline staff use when dealing with any type of infectious disease, including SARS and Ebola.\" But given current concerns about coronavirus, Bowie adds, people may spot paramedics wearing the gear on a more regular basis. Do precautions have anything to do with SARS? Clinicians learned a lot from the deadly SARS outbreak in Toronto, which helped boost infection control protocols and prompted widespread adoption of personal protective gear, Bowie says. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also spread from a strain of coronavirus. The illness killed hundreds of people and afflicted thousands more around the world in the early 2000s — and in the Toronto area, it mainly hit healthcare workers.   (Supplied by Toronto Paramedic Services) Bowie says before that wake-up call, emergency responders didn't worry much about protective gear. \"We didn't always think about wearing gloves. We didn't always think about wearing masks,\" he says. \"It just wasn't on our radar as daily safety precautions.\ " U.S. reports 1st case of person-to-person spread of coronavirus The bottom line nowadays? It's better to be safe than sick. \"Paramedics are going to spend a lot of time in the back of an ambulance with these patients,\ " Bowie says. \"So they've got to protect themselves.\"
  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states.

That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said. Mask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more actionHome care workers worry about shortage of protective equipment during pandemic: union \"Those are the masks that you want to consider reprocessing. But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Alberta health officials and doctors continue to work behind the scenes to prepare for any potential cases of COVID-19, the name scientists have given to the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta. But a spike in international cases — mostly in China — has pushed the number of people confirmed to have COVID-19 above 59,000. The death toll now sits at more than 1,300 worldwide. At the Crowfoot Village Family Practice in northwest Calgary, posters featuring red stop signs warn patients who have a new cough and are feeling sick to don a mask for the duration of their visit. Boxes of surgical masks can be found on the counter at the reception desk. Signs reminding patients to put on a mask if they have a cough and are feeling sick are posted at the Crowfoot Village Family Practice. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Staff have been given a refresher on infection control, and the supply room is stocked with supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer and isolation protection kits. The kits include gowns, masks and other disposable equipment. \"For us, this is not unlike how we get ready for regular flu season,\" said the clinic's medical director and family doctor, Dr. Janet Reynolds. She has been monitoring regular updates on COVID-19 from various organizations, including Alberta Health Services. \"If patients come in with a fever, cough, cold, we ask them to put a mask on when they come to reception and try to put them directly into an exam room so that they're not potentially spreading their infection to other vulnerable patients.\" Patients who have a cough and are feeling unwell are asked to wear a mask for the duration of their appointment. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) A key difference, though, is staff are asking about a  patient's travel history, since that is one of the criteria that would trigger concerns about potential exposure to the novel coronavirus. According to Reynolds, while they've received phone calls from people — who have either travelled to China or have been exposed to someone who has and are worried about COVID-19 — they have yet to see any patients in the office with symptoms and a travel history warranting testing. She says people who call in and are feeling unwell are encouraged to stay home. In some cases, they're being prompted to call Health Link, the province's health advice and information line (dial 811). 811 calls coming in In the past week , Health Link has received an average 40-50 calls per day related to the novel coronavirus, out of a daily total ranging from 1,800 to 2,000 calls. The latest numbers released by Alberta Health, updated on Feb. 7, show 28 Albertans have been tested for the illness and all tests have come back negative. \"I think we're at a really critical point right now, globally, and I think that is relevant to Alberta,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.   Supplies of masks, gloves and isolation gowns at Crowfoot Village Family Practice. The clinic's medical director says they've had no trouble obtaining supplies. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) According to Hinshaw, the risk to Alberta continues to be low and the next few weeks will be pivotal in terms of containing the illness. \"I think it's too early to declare it one way or another. But again, the current risk in Alberta remains low. … We continue to do a lot of work on screening people and supporting people who are staying home, and also if there are people who are symptomatic, making sure that they get appropriate testing and advice,\ " she said. Work is going on behind the scenes to prepare for any cases that may show up in this province. Hinshaw says there are stockpiles of medical supplies that can be moved around the province as needed. \"At the moment, it's business as usual on the front lines and in the background making sure that there are extra supplies if we should need them.\ " In January, the province worked to secure extra supplies including surgical masks and specialized N95 respirator masks that are required for procedures where there is a risk that tiny droplets containing the virus could become airborne. That includes CPR,  intubation (where a tube is inserted to help a person breathe) and the use of nebulizers, which give a patient medication in the form of a mist through a mask. \"There was an extra order put in for additional personal protective equipment just in case it's needed — just out of an abundance of caution,\ " she said.   The clinic has medical supplies, including infection prevention kits, in the event that potential cases of the novel coronavirus show up. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Alberta  Health says that order was placed early in an effort to avoid any potential shortages and it has already been received.  But officials won't speculate on how long those supplies could last or how many people could be treated with the additional stock. In an email to CBC News, a government spokesperson said \"it would depend on a wide range of factors. However, health officials continually evaluate and assess the province's stockpile of medical supplies and equipment, and will continue to do so. …  While we're acting out of an abundance of caution, we do not expect that extra supplies will be needed in the immediate future.\" Front-line health staff have also been given detailed instructions and updates on how to use infection control equipment and what type of equipment is required and when. 
  No new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Hamilton as of noon Friday, according to officials. During a video update Paul Johnson, who is leading the city's emergency operation's centre, spoke on behalf of public health and said Hamilton still has 23 cases of the new coronavirus. \"I can confirm that there are no new cases in Hamilton over yesterday to our regular media deadline of 12 p.m. today.\ " That's despite the fact a daily provincial list, shared this morning included two new confirmed cases, as of 10:30 a.m. —man in his 40s who travelled to the U.S. and a woman in her 70s who went on a cruise in the Caribbean. It's not clear why the discrepancy. Public health says it updates its case numbers once daily, while the province provides two updates. Johnson went on to say that though the majority of COVID-19 cases in the city are linked to travel, two have no obvious connection to trips outside the country, meaning they represent \"early indications of community transmission.\" Why it's so difficult to get tested for COVID-19 in CanadaHamilton frontline health worker asks public to send face masks for emergency unit Most of the people who contracted the virus are in self-isolation, though an 80-year-old resident of a Stoney Creek nursing home and one other person remain in hospital. \"In Hamilton no deaths have occurred,\" said Johnson. Hospitals closing doors to visitors The update came as both Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) and St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton moved to ban visitors from their hospitals. As of 7 a.m. Friday morning, St. Joe's implemented a no-visitor policy, which it calls \"a necessary measure\" to combat the spread of the virus. HHS plans to do the same, starting at noon. \"We acknowledge the important role family/loved ones play in supporting patients,\" St. Joe's said in a tweet. \"As we work as a community to contain the virus, limiting hospital traffic is a necessary measure to ensure the health and well-being of our patients and healthcare workers, and to keep the public safe.\" Hamilton hospitals will stop allowing visitors starting Friday. (Terry Asma/CBC) There will be exceptions on a case-by-case basis at St. Joe's, including compassionate visits for palliative patients, the partners of women in labour, and select other special cases. HHS also detailed several exceptions, including the following:   A pediatric patient being tested for COVID-19 or that is a confirmed case. One family member or caregiver is allowed in ambulatory areas or the emergency department if they are considered essential support. One person may also accompany a patient for surgery, taking them to the preparation area and picking them up outside the hospital entrance if necessary.

  Canada notified the United States and Mexico Thursday evening that it has finished its ratification process and is now ready to implement the measures in the revised North American trade agreement. \"This is an important step towards implementing this essential trade agreement,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland in a statement released Friday morning.  \"The Canadian government will continue to work with the United States and Mexican governments to determine an 'entry into force' date that is mutually beneficial.\ " Freeland added she was hopeful that \"with this step ... the new NAFTA will enter into force later this year.\" News that Canada had given its notice was first reported by the American publication Inside U.S. Trade. The Canada–U.S.–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) will take effect on the first day of the third month after all three countries have given their notice of readiness to comply with its new measures. The U.S. and Mexico have yet to send a similar notice of readiness to the other two partners. If they do so before the end of April, the deal could take effect on July 1. The Trump administration had hoped to have the deal in place for June 1. Earlier this week, the lack of notice from any of the three countries meant that deadline was missed. Revised NAFTA will not take effect on June 1, as Trump had hoped The coronavirus pandemic has prompted calls to delay implementation — perhaps until as late as this fall — as government and industrial resources are diverted to more urgent needs. \"We want to ensure the new NAFTA will support a strong economic recovery once we have put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us,\ " Freeland's statement said. ' Now is not the time' : Chamber of Commerce \"We welcome the next step in the ratification process to keep forward momentum of this important modernization of the original NAFTA,\" said Mark Agnew, the director of international policy for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.   \"However, Canadian businesses have repeatedly said that given the substantial disruption caused by COVID-19, now is not the time for CUSMA to enter into force. Companies are managing their existing supply chains and cash flow problems,\ " he added, noting the original NAFTA is still functioning and companies need time to bring their systems into compliance. \"The government needs to explore delaying entry into force or grace periods for certain provisions.\" Nearly-empty streets are seen near the Canada/USA border crossing in Windsor, Ont. on March 21, as non-essential travel between the two countries ground to a halt in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.   (Rob Gurdebeke/Canadian Press) The revised agreement's new North American content requirements require vehicle manufacturers to closely analyze and possibly revise their current suppliers for both intermediate parts and raw materials. But some companies in the automotive supply chain on both sides of the border are preoccupied at the moment — urgently retooling to help manufacture necessary medical supplies. Canada's dairy sector has asked for the coming into force date to be delayed until after August 1, so the agreement's global export restrictions on products like skim milk and baby formula don't begin to phase in until the start of the dairy industry's next fiscal year. Delaying one more month could be worth tens of millions of dollars for the dairy sector, the industry has told the federal government. \"We had asked the government to put some consideration into the timing of their ratification, especially given the concerns expressed by the auto and dairy sectors,\" said Conservative trade critic Randy Hoback. \"They were very clear that they would need some time to adapt before the implementation of the agreement.\ "   Hoback added that he hopes the government took the time to review the recommendations it received from the Official Opposition when the Commons trade committee reviewed C-4, the government's implementation legislation, last month. He noted that mitigation measures (such as more compensation for farmers) should be put in place for businesses that may suffer under the new deal. In notifying now, Canada has surrendered control over the timing of the deal's implementation to the other two partners. On the other hand, the Trump administration can no longer accuse Canada of dragging its feet. On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators cautioned against proceeding before Mexico has proven it's ready to comply with the agreement's more demanding labour provisions. ' First step is to resolve it' Canada gave its notice of ratification as fresh cross-border tensions emerged over the White House pressuring medical supplier 3M to stop exporting respirators to other countries, including NAFTA partner Canada. The Trump administration has invoked the U.S. Defence Production Act, justifying the trade restriction on national security grounds. In a statement Friday, 3M warned the U.S. administration that other countries may retaliate in return. 3M faces pressure from Trump order to stop exporting N95 masks to CanadaUpdatedFight over N95 masks shows Trump testing ethical, legal limits in COVID-19 crisis \"By U.S. law, Canada is part of the U.S. military-industrial complex,\ " Freeland said Friday.

  Like many, Hilary MacMillan has been glued to the news amid the coronavirus pandemic. But when the Toronto fashion designer began seeing stories raising the alarm about a shortage of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment, she was moved to action. \"We wanted to kind of get on the ground and see if it's something we could help out with, before it gets to the point when there's nothing available,\ " said the womenswear designer. After just a few days of work this past week, MacMillan and her two seamstresses (who were each sewing from home) completed 100 non-medical grade masks, with the initial batch headed to staff at a local pharmacy. An organization representing in-home personal support workers has been in touch about next week's batch, with MacMillan aiming to produce 100 a week for organizations requesting them. \"What we're trying to do is create masks for the vulnerable and other workers who have nothing available,\ " MacMillan said. \"It's nice to keep busy. It's nice to feel like we're not just watching, but that we're helping out.\ " Toronto fashion designer Hilary MacMillan has temporarily shifted from creating her eponymous womenswear line to making and donating non-medical grade masks for use by a variety of groups, including grocery store staff, pharmacy workers and in-home personal support workers. (Ted Belton/Hilary MacMillan) Around the globe, companies of all stripes have been pivoting to aid in the fight against the coronavirus, from distilleries producing hand sanitizers to auto parts manufacturers and vacuum companies exploring how to make ventilators.   The apparel industry has also joined in.

It includes items such as gloves, gowns, lab coats, shoe coverings, goggles, face shields and more. Used in conjuction with specific infection control procedures, PPE is a vital resource. But amid the coronavirus pandemic, PPE is being rapidly sapped as front line health-care workers cross paths with, test and treat thousands of people. ' Our wicked problem': B.C. seeks more personal protective equipment as COVID-19 cases mountOntario hospital staff told to ration masks as COVID-19 spreads \"You can't wear the same equipment all day. This is why they go through a lot of [PPE] because they have to change it between patients,\" said Jan Chappel, senior technical specialist at the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety.   You don't want to bring the disease to the next patient and the next.- Jan Chappel, of Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety \"You don't want to bring the disease to the next patient and the next,\ " she continued, adding that PPE would need to be worn by anyone coming into contact with an infectious disease patient — from doctors and nurses to cleaning staff making the rounds. Workers inspect newly made surgical masks in a factory in Hong Kong. Personal protective equipment used by front line health-care workers must be certified by groups like the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Canadian Standards Association. (Isaac Lawrence/AFP via Getty Images) Must use specific materials There are also specific standards behind the production of PPE, which is regulated and must be certified by agencies, like the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Canadian Standards Association.    Take for example the N95 respirator, which is part of the PPE being used by front line medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak.  These devices must be fitted properly and are \"made with a very specific material,\ " Chappel said.   \"These are [masks] that you wouldn't be making at home with a regular cotton fabric. It's a very specific type of fibre. … Particles become attached to the fibre, so it doesn't get through the mask and [aren't breathed in by] the person wearing the mask.\" Masks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear them Companies shifting their production to making PPE must use the right materials and go through proper certification, she emphasized, saying that it may be easier for some manufacturers (for instance Bauer's temporary shift from hockey masks to face shields) to retool their production lines. Manufacturers around the world have been retooling their facilities to help meet the demand for protective equipment for health care workers. Here, Kvassy Huffman sews hospital masks at Detroit Sewn in Pontiac, Mich., which normally makes clothing.   (Rebecca Cook/Reuters) Making community appeals The need for PPE by health-care workers around the globe is a real concern, according to Mitze Mourinho, president of Michael Garron Hospital Foundation. \"There's a huge need in the system and around the world. [Every hospital or health-care facility] is drawing on the same supplies.\" For instance, with ballooning cases in populous U.S. states like California and New York, \"they've really drawn on supplies worldwide,\ " Mourinho said. \"[In Canada] , we are going into our peak period over the next number of weeks, so we and other … hospitals need to make sure we have the right supplies internally and that they keep coming during this difficult period.\" Amid the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals worldwide are vying for the same kind of protective gear, including masks, N95 respirators, gloves, face shields and long-sleeved gowns. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) To that effect, like some of their peers across Canada, Michael Garron Hospital kicked off a PPE drive early this week, calling for donations of unopened, unexpired equipment from veterinarians, dentists, other health professionals and wider industry players who use the same items.   Donate your masks, gloves, goggles and gowns at a Toronto hospital, doctor urges The Toronto hospital's appeal sparked a tremendous response beyond just donations of the items requested, Mourinho said. Staff also got a flood of other offers — for everything from 3D-printed visors and masks to movie production trailers, storage bins and delivery trucks — and suggestions. Among them was the idea to call out for homesewn masks — not for front line health-care providers, but for others who might require or desire a basic face covering. That could mean visitors coming into the hospital (though visitors are severely limited at the moment because of the outbreak), as well as patients being discharged from the hospital and reintegrated into the community, Mourinho said. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /MichaelGarronHospital?src =hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MichaelGarronHospital</a> needs 1,000 masks a week, and you can help!

In the U.S., the Centres for Disease Control has suggested homemade masks as a last-resort for health care workers dealing with coronavirus if no medical-grade masks are available.    Heartened by the public outpouring Coupled with other measures  — including being worn (and removed) correctly, washed daily, strictly following physical distancing measures and thorough, frequent hand-washing — she feels these masks can be useful for those who may not currently be high priority for medical masks.   They could also aid in freeing up incoming batches of PPE to go specifically to the frontline healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19. Depending on how many of the two-ply, homesewn masks are received (a website sharing instructions notes that all donations will be examined and initially cleaned at the hospital), extras could also be redistributed for use by the wider community.

(China Daily/Reuters) It is not known if any health workers were among the 2,641 new coronavirus cases reported by China's National Health Commission on Friday night.   The new cases bring the total number of people in mainland China infected with the virus, which causes an illness called COVID-19, to 66,492.   The commission also reported 143 more deaths on Friday, mostly in Hubei province, bringing the coronavirus death toll across mainland China to 1,523.   China recently changed the way it is reporting data from the hard-hit Hubei province to include positive cases diagnosed by CT scan.  The World Health Organization (WHO), which provides its own daily tally of cases, is only including cases that have been confirmed with a lab test. WHO investigates spread and severity Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, said at a briefing Friday that the Geneva-based health agency is seeking further clarity from China on how health workers in Hubei are arriving at the clinical diagnosis to ensure other respiratory diseases like the flu aren't being mixed into COVID-19 data. A WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, Ghebreyesus said. The mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 health workers contracted the virus. \"Particular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,\ " Ghebreyesus said.   WATCH: WHO officials talk about diagnosis of health-care workers.

Ryan said WHO officials will work with China to better understand how health-care workers are getting infected, so that those on the front lines can be better protected. Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly spoken of a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks.

  The first health-care worker at a Quebec long-term care home to test positive for COVID-19 had, like thousands of other Quebecers, recently returned from a trip abroad during the province's early March break.   Her case was reported March 14 by the health board for the Lanaudière region, just northeast of Montreal. In retrospect, it was a warning of how easily the coronavirus could enter seniors' residential institutions, known in the province as CHSLDs. One day before, in what had seemed like an harsh measure to some, Premier François Legault had banned visits to all seniors' homes when he declared a public health emergency.   It was already too late. Outbreaks were reported at a number of residences in the following days. On March 18, Mariette Tremblay, 82, a resident of a private seniors' home in the same Lanaudière region, died of COVID-19 and became Quebec's first known victim of the pandemic.  She had had a visit from a family member back from a trip. Infection spread through a Sherbrooke seniors' home, too, after a family reunion. Vectors of the coronavirus — family and health-care staff returning from abroad — had entered the CHSLDs, home to the province's most vulnerable to the disease, long before Legault called for an end to visits. But a failure to respond quickly and effectively in the weeks since has allowed COVID-19 to spread almost unhindered in dozens of homes, according to interviews with health-care workers, union representatives and a review of documents that demonstrate a lack of clear directives.   Workers on the front lines describe chaos inside the homes as increasing numbers of staff and residents fell sick, including a lack of protective equipment for themselves and residents who had not yet caught the disease. They also say whatever measures were in place to prevent spread of the virus weren't fully respected. Some workers who tested positive say they were ordered to return work before the end of their quarantine. Now residents of those homes account for the vast majority of the COVID-19 death toll in Quebec. Of the 1,340 dead tallied so far in Quebec, 1,057 were seniors in care. The crisis is far from over.  More than 80 homes considered \"critical\" by the province, a number that has doubled in the past week.   At least 4,000 health-care workers have tested positive for COVID-19 and another 5,500 are absent from work, making it difficult for many CHSLDs to provide the most basic care.   One emergency room doctor at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital has described how patients are being wheeled into the ER, not sick from COVID-19, but because they are dehydrated and malnourished. Slow to adapt after focus on hospitals When a woman who had been travelling in Iran was reported to be the first case in the province Feb. 28, the province said the threat was still minimal — and the focus was on preparing hospitals. \"All the measures that are necessary to protect the population, to protect the workers and take care of the patients, if it occurs, are there,\" Danielle McCann, the provincial health minister, said at the time. But as it became clear the bigger threat was in long-term care homes and other kinds of seniors' residences, the province was critcized for being slow to reallocate resources and staff. Alain Croteau, a union president representing workers at the Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal health agency, described the response as \"very chaotic, very disorganized.\ " By March 30, two weeks after the ban on visits to hospitals and seniors' homes, the province announced the number of cases had surpassed 3,000.   At Quebec nursing home, orderlies worked without PPE, COVID-19 patients wandered halls That day, it announced $133 million in emergency funding for CHSLDs and other kinds of seniors' establishments. \"We will be able to hire more staff, buy more protective equipment and more disinfectant,\" said Quebec's minister for seniors, Marguerite Blais.   In the weeks that followed, however, it became clear many residences were still operating without enough gloves, masks or gowns. Workers in Laurentians bought their own, for instance. So did nurses in Laval, fundraising with colleagues on social media and buying N95 masks and Bauer visors from friends of friends. Directives published March 25 by Laval's health board stated staff in CHSLDs don't have to wear N95s, even when treating COVID-positive patients, unless the patients are on oxygen machines. \"The reason for that remains nebulous to me,\" said Jessika Côté, an emergency room nurse in Laval. She was reassigned to work at a hard-hit seniors' residence, CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée, where at least 74 patients have died and more than 90 per cent of residents have tested positive.   A health-care worker is seen in the window of the CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée in Laval. Some workers have alleged they were forced to keep working at the short-staffed residence despite being symptomatic. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Mixed messages Even before the pandemic, CHSLDs across the province struggled to recruit enough nurses and patient attendants to provide quality care. Recognizing that poor pay could trigger absenteeism and make a chronic staffing shortage even worse, on April 1, the Quebec government boosted wages by eight per cent in public CHSLDs, and by $4 an hour in private long-term care homes.   But as conditions grew worse and more and more health-care workers started getting sick, workers who had tested positive for COVID-19 were ordered to return to CHSLDs before the end of a normally compulsory 14-day quarantine. THE DOSEHow to help seniors get through the COVID-19 pandemic At CHSLD Laflèche, a long-term care home in Shawinigan, for instance, workers who had been exposed to COVID-19 were told to leave isolation early because there was no staff to replace them. In early April, McCann defended the decision, saying it was \"exceptional\" and based on \"scientific advice\" provided by Quebec's public health institute. \"Leaving people all by themselves without services — we cannot do that,\" she said. The government still has not banned outright the practice of health-care workers putting in shifts at more than one nursing home, despite warnings from workers of the increased risk of spreading the virus. Côté, the ER nurse, believes there would be thousands fewer health-care workers absent or sick today if the province had provided workers with the right equipment and clearer directives. Jessika Côté, usually an emergency room nurse at Cité-de-la-Santé, the main hospital in Laval, was reassigned to CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée, where at least 69 residents have died since the pandemic began. (Submitted by Jessika Côté) When she arrived at CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée on April 3, Côté said managers didn't even know she was coming and didn't give her any training.   She was sent to one of the home's hot zones, where she scrambled to provide residents a minimum of care. Côté says the CHSLD only provided a surgical face mask, a gown and a pair of gloves.   In the days that followed, she observed staff circulating between cold and hot zones without changing gowns — a major potential vector for the virus, she said.   Instead of changing gloves, many would simply wash or sanitize them, she said. Côté said the circumstances only got worse in the days that followed — a heavier workload, more deaths, and COVID-positive patients being transferred back into areas where some hadn't yet caught the disease. \"They said that since most of the CHSLD was contaminated anyway, there was no point having designated zones,\ " Côté said. Côté said she and her colleagues cried every day.    \"The co-ordinator would go from nurse to nurse, and we would all be in tears because we just couldn't anymore,\ " she said.     Of the 25 ER nurses who were sent to work in Laval CHSLDs, Côté said, nine have since caught the coronavirus. Côté is one of them. As awful as COVID-19 can be, Côté said, it was a relief when she received her positive result over a week ago.   \"I love my work, so I don't like saying this, but it finally gave me a break,\" she said. In a few days, she'll be going back to Sainte-Dorothée, where she's heard things are a little better. Offers of help, unheeded In recent weeks, as the crisis has become even more acute, Legault has repeatedly called on health-care workers to help staff the besieged nursing homes. But many say they put their names forward early in the pandemic but weren't able to secure a position, with the hiring bureaucracy overwhelmed. Natalie Stake-Doucet, the president of Quebec's nurses association, said she tried for weeks to offer her assistance at a CHSLD.   \"It took, finally, talking directly to someone who I know who happens to be a manager and got me a job,\ " she said. \"When I got there, it was devastation. I've never seen anything like it. It was shocking and sad and overwhelming,\" she said. Quebec Premier François Legault said Friday that the 'big lesson' he's learned in this pandemic is that long-term care homes need more staff and more space. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press) Stake-Doucet, now a PhD candidate and nursing instructor at the Université de Montréal, stopped working full-time as a nurse two years ago, in part out of frustration over the impact of cuts to the health-care network on patient care. She blames health reforms imposed by the previous Liberal government on the breakdown in communication between health authorities and health-care workers on the front lines. She said the chronic staff shortages in the CHSLDs prior to the crisis have made the problem even worse. In his daily briefings, Legault has said repeatedly that the time will come to examine all that went wrong.  In a strikingly frank mea culpa a week ago, the premier said he takes \"full responsibility\" and is filled with remorse that \"we didn't better care for the elderly, the most vulnerable.\" Legault says he should have raised wages of long-term care workers long ago On Friday, he said he is \"not excluding\" the possibility of taking over all private seniors' homes and creating a network of more spacious, better-staffed and more home-like residences for the aged across the province.   He said he'd learned \"a big lesson\" about the need for less crowding and more staff. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Quebec's long-term care institutions, Legault said, has been like setting fire to hay.   \"Everything burns rapidly,\" he said. 
 Manitobans can help reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 by wearing non-medical masks, chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says. While symptomatic people account for most of the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, there is growing evidence of asymptomatic spread as well, and wearing a covering can help prevent that, Roussin said at a news conference Monday morning. \"If you choose to wear a non-medical mask , if you go out in the public, you may be protecting others,\" he said. However, that still isn't the best way to protect others, Roussin said. There have been 204 cases in the province between March 10 and April 6, public health officials say. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC) \"I don't want [masks] to be a distraction. The real message is to stay home.\ " Previously, Roussin said masks aren't necessary to protect people from COVID-19 and that they should be practising physical distancing and hand hygiene.

Our goal isn't to remain consistent, but respond to the information as it comes,\ " he said. People who do wear masks should clean them frequently, be careful not to touch their mouth, nose or eyes with them and clean their hands often, he said. They should also maintain their physical distancing and stay home as much as possible. Roussin's comments come after a similar message from the nation's top doctor.

The number of active cases, meaning people who are still experiencing symptoms of the virus and have not recovered, is 185. There are still 11 people in hospital and seven in intensive care, he said. Although only one new case was announced Monday, Roussin wasn't optimistic about the future. \"Don't expect many days like this,\" he said. Shared Health chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa said there are still 14 heath-care workers infected with the virus. As of April 4, 12,514 COVID-19 tests had been performed in Manitoba. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC) The Cadham Provincial Lab completed 458 tests on Sunday; as of Monday, a total of 13,476 tests have been performed. The province is looking at expanding testing criteria, Roussin said, but wants to ensure that's sustainable and that high-risk people remain a priority. ' Stay home' Roussin reiterated people should stay home and not go out in public, even to places of worship, especially given upcoming religious holidays, including Passover, Easter and Ramadan. \"We know from other jurisdictions that a lot of transmission has occurred at faith-based gatherings,\" he said. Few people are venturing out on Winnipeg streets due to physical distancing measures aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) \"You're not only putting yourself at risk but all Manitobans at risk when you attend gatherings like this.\ " With the weather improving, Roussin also discouraged people in the province from going to their cabins because they could overwhelm smaller health-care centres if they become sick.

  Family and friends normally would gather to share stories of loved ones lost in industrial accidents on the Day of Mourning, but this year will be different. Speeches will be presented online on the Windsor and District Labour Council's website and Facebook page including stories from those working in essential jobs during the pandemic. For a local registered nurse it's also an opportunity for health care workers to educate the public on the seriousness of COVID-19. \"A lot of people are taking it, I'm going to say a bit of a cavalier attitude. They feel that it's not as bad as the flu or it's not any different than the flu, where in fact it is extremely serious,\ " said Jo-Dee Brown, registered nurse and bargaining president for Ontario Nurses Association, Local 8 - which represents nurses at Hotel Dieu Grace Healthcare. She and others continue to advocate for appropriate PPE for health professionals, as it can be very risky to be in the public and potentially pass on the virus to others. Adding many health care workers are living in trailers and hotel rooms to protect their families and others from COVID-19. Wearing PPE all day is taxing on the workers. Brown said many complain about headaches and nausea from wearing masks all day. \"Sometimes you feel like you're suffocating when you have the mask on and it's hot in some of the rooms and you're wearing all that gear and you have to know that you have to do it, but mentally it's a challenge,\ " she said. Canadian nurse working at Detroit hospital: 'We are fighting a war'Windsor nurse, family craft homemade hair covers to protect against COVID-19 There's an additional issue for nurses right now, which Brown thinks could trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. \"We are going to have health care workers that will never mentally emotionally recover from the experiences of having to hold the hands of dying people that were strangers to them because nobody else could be there for them,\ " she said. The best way to show support for essential workers is to continue to respect physical distancing, hand washing and only shopping for essentials, said Brown. She also wants people to remember the two nurses and one doctor that died as a result of SARS in 2003, which led to a commission. \"We learned many, many lessons and the government was given many, many recommended recommendations,\ " Brown said. \"And it's very unfortunate that in 2020 when we needed those recommendations most it seemed like they were forgotten.\ " Online event Family of those who have lost loved ones to industrial accidents taped their stories, which will be played online. Tammy Lewis' sister was killed in 2007 at Prince Metal Products. She said although they won't be all together in person to share her story, it means a lot to be able to share it at all. \"We get together , we share our stories and we talk about our loved ones which is a form of healing for us as well to other families,\" she said. This the 36th Day of Mourning, although it will be online, there will be a wreath to commemorate the day. Antonella Ciampa, one of the organizers will be playing it on behalf of the community, which she filmed and will be part of the online presentation. This year it was important for them to include essential workers. \"They're the ones on the front line and being exposed to so many risks of COVID-19 and they're the ones that are the essential workers keeping our lives as normal as possible,\ " Ciampa said. The Day of Mourning is for all workers who risk their lives on the job and remind people to stand up for their own rights. \"It's ensuring that the legislation of health and safety of the right to know and the right to refuse work is encouraged in workers so that they do stay safe and healthy,\" she said. The Windsor and District Labour Council is also asking the public to shine a candle in their front window or balcony at 8:20 p.m. April 28 for 20 minutes to remember and honour those killed or injured on the job, as well for those who continue to work during the pandemic. 
  On the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, the days are long and stressful.  Despite working with a close-knit and supportive team, one day Felicia Letourneau, a nurse at Lakeshore General Hospital, started her shift feeling discouraged. Then, she noticed a bag full of gifts for everyone in her unit — headbands, with tags that read \"Headbands for Heroes\" — and that lifted her spirits. \"I've been a surgical practical nurse for 12 years and I've never felt so appreciated,\ " Letourneau said. For many frontline health-care workers, wearing masks for their entire shift, every shift, is a strain on their skin, especially on their ears. But Letourneau and hundreds of her colleagues in Montreal are a little more comfortable these days, thanks to these handmade headbands. The headbands have buttons sewn on, which hold the mask's elastic ear loops in place, avoiding any contact with or strain on ears. The words on the tag are especially touching, Letourneau said. \"It reminds us what we're doing and that we are heroes … working hard.\ " The people behind the headbands Volunteers, part of a Montreal Facebook group called Operation MTL Covid 19 - Virtual Helping Hands, are behind the headband-making initiative. Sabrina Maryse Stoute, a senior nurse working for a pharmaceutical company, started the Facebook group. She remembers her days as an emergency room nurse and the pain she experienced wearing masks for extended periods of time. She wanted to find a way to help friends and former colleagues who are still on the frontlines, so she did some research online and learned that patterns exist for \"Headbands for Heroes\" and initiatives exist in other provinces and countries. Each delivery includes a variety of colours and sizes and enough headbands for every worker in the department - from housekeeping staff to physicians, said organizer Sabrina Maryse Stoute. (Submitted by Sabrina Maryse Stoute)   The only problem? Stoute can't sew. So she recruited two friends, Kristy Westlake, an elementary school teacher, and Tanya D'Amato, a customer service administrator, and they put the call out on social media, looking for more volunteers. \"They just came running,\ " Stoute said. The Facebook group now has more than 1,400 members. Stoute is co-ordinating 30 women of all ages who are sewing headbands for Montreal health-care workers every day. \"They've been producing bands in record time … 654 headbands in 12 days, which is incredible,\ " she said. For some of the volunteers, sewing is a distraction from loneliness and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I say 'busy hands, calm minds,'\" Stoute said. Sabrina Maryse Stoute started the Facebook group Operation MTL Covid 19 - Virtual Helping Hands and runs it with friends Kristy Westlake and Tanya D’Amato. (Submitted by Sabrina Maryse Stoute)   All the volunteers involved in sewing must be self-isolating, with the exception of buying groceries once a week, and they must have no symptoms, Stoute said. Stoute is limiting her travel, so all the sewing volunteers must live relatively close to her home, on Montreal's West Island. She has no physical contact with volunteers — they wave to her from their windows when she collects the headbands from their porches. Stoute takes charge of dropping off materials, picking up headbands, and making deliveries to hospitals. When Stoute arrives at a hospital with a delivery, even though everyone is wearing masks, \"you can still see in their eyes, the smile, the happiness and the gratitude.\" Headbands in high demand Orders for the headbands keep pouring in from various departments at several Montreal hospitals and from long-term care facilities. The group is currently preparing headbands for two CHSLDs, the emergency department at the Jewish General Hospital, the psychiatry department at St. Mary's Hospital, and the COVID-19 unit at the Lakeshore General Hospital. The Facebook group has also received more than $1,700 in donations, money that goes toward purchasing elastics, buttons and other materials, and has bought meals for more than 140 health-care workers so far. \"They're taking care of our community, so our community needs to take care of them,\" Stoute said. Constantly wearing masks is a strain on healthcare workers' skin, especially their ears. A Montreal community is helping ease that pain by sewing hundreds of \"Headbands for Heroes\" and delivering them to hospitals. Daybreak's Shari Okeke brings us that story. 12:02 Once the crisis is over, Stoute says she's looking forward to meeting the women working so hard sewing the headbands every day. \"I haven't met any of them in person and I just want to give them a hug,\ " she said. \"They are heroes as much as anyone.\"
  Montreal nurses who have volunteered to work in a private long-term care home with a major COVID-19 outbreak said there is \"shockingly little\" protective gear available for employees, despite assurances from the Quebec government that equipment shortages across the province no longer exist. Nurses from elsewhere in the network who have been called in to help at CHSLD Vigi Mont-Royal in the Town of Mount Royal, an independent municipality within the city of Montreal, describe fellow health-care workers wearing the same protective gear for hours — not changing gloves and masks between patients because there are not enough to spare. According to the Quebec government's latest figures, Vigi Mont-Royal is the fourth-most infected long-term care home in the province, with 157 residents, or 56 per cent, having tested positive for COVID-19. One nurse who CBC has agreed not to identify described seeing some of the private home's original staff working in jeans and T-shirts or simple scrubs. In one case, she said, she saw a worker with a blanket wrapped around them as a makeshift gown. The nurse said that staff were moving between so-called hot zones within the home where infected residents were concentrated and cold, or infection-free, zones without changing their protective equipment, which could hasten the spread of the illness. \"Even the residents who weren't infected were now treated as being infected,\ " she said. \"There's no winning. We don't have the resources to have the proper practices and a normal standard of care.\ " INTERACTIVEFind the COVID-19 benefits and programs relevant to you While the nurse said hospital staff would bring loads of extra protective gear with them to the home, it was never enough, and staff still had to ration it by wearing the same gear while caring for multiple residents.   No shortage of PPE, says health minister It's a sharp contrast from the portrait painted by Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann, who said Tuesday that staff should now have enough protective material and should not be reusing single-use gear. When asked at the province's daily briefing Wednesday about reports of continued shortages, McCann suggested it could be a problem of distribution, rather than a lack of supply.

We will respond in the next hour,' Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said Wednesday when asked about health-care worker complaints about shortages of protective gear. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press) Vigi Mont-Royal is owned by Vigi Santé, which operates 15 private long-term care homes, known in Quebec as CHSLDs, across the province.   Three of the company's other homes are also dealing with COVID-19 cases, according to the latest figures from the Quebec government. At CHSLD Vigi de Dollard-des-Ormeaux, 89 residents, or 56 per cent, have tested positive, and at CHSLD Vigi santé Pierrefonds, there are 25 cases, or 39 per cent of all residents.   The Vigi Reine Élizabeth Montréal in NDG is less acutely affected, with eight confirmed cases, or only five per cent of residents.   A spokesperson for Vigi Santé said no one was available for an interview Wednesday. ' Winging it' in a crisis Nurses who arrived to help at the Vigi Mont-Royal home said they were given only a cursory orientation and lacked information about residents, their charts and medications. They described having difficulty identifying residents, relying on photographs attached to residents' charts when there was no regular staff member nearby to guide them. UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear themThe tragic cost of barring family caregivers from nursing homes is a wake-up call, family says \"Residents were not in the rooms that were assigned to them,\" said one nurse, who said that some residents had identity bracelets but others did not. \"So [it was] a guessing game and trying to associate their pictures to their rooms. It's essentially winging it.\" A health-care worker is seen in the window of the CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée in Laval wearing a full face shield, mask and gown. That protective gear is in short supply at CHSLD Vigi Mont-Royal, replacement nurses sent in to help staff in the home say. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) She said this amplified the risk of administering medications to the wrong people, which could have serious medical consequences. All the while, she said, the phone was ringing off the hook with family members calling for updates on their loved ones. \"They're asking, 'How are they?' and if they are OK, and are they alive,\" she said. Family members were relieved to get the slightest bit of information. \"They would thank us a million times and say, 'Thank you for picking up.'\"  \"It's heartbreaking. I feel it's the bare minimum that they deserve.\" She said the inability to do more for family members has added to her frustration. \"You don't feel like you're making a difference. You feel helpless, in a way.\ "

(Christophe Ena/Associated Press) Bulgaria's Orthodox Christian majority has been urged to stay away from church services during the upcoming Easter holidays, but the church is resisting calls to close — making it the only denomination in the country not to do so. Health officials have voiced fears that many worshippers might ignore the quarantine and attend the church services.  Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said the government would not intervene. Sweden's strategy for fighting COVID-19 differs from most European countries, appearing comparatively more relaxed. Stockholm was quiet but far from deserted on Saturday as Swedes sought to make the most of the sunshine. Swedish authorities have advised the public to practise social distancing, but schools, bars and restaurants are still open, and only gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned. So far, some 373 people have died from COVID-19 in Sweden and there are almost 6,500 cases.

Air raid sirens wailed and flags were at half-mast. The pandemic was first detected in Wuhan in December.   Why some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claims   The city was placed under complete lockdown on Jan. 23 in an effort to stem the spread of the virus and has been lauded as a \"heroic city\" by the nation's communist leadership for the sacrifices made by its 11 million citizens. People have gradually been allowed to travel in and out of Wuhan under strict conditions. The quarantine in the city is to be formally lifted on Wednesday.

Egypt has reported 1,070 confirmed cases and 71 fatalities from the global pandemic. Authorities have closed schools and mosques, banned public gatherings and imposed a nighttime curfew to prevent the virus from spreading among the population of 100 million, a fifth of whom live in the densely populated capital, Cairo. Kenya has ordered the quarantine period extended for two weeks in facilities where some people went on \"partying sprees\" and might have spread the new coronavirus. Officials on Saturday reported a high number of cases among those in quarantine facilities and accused some people of not taking social distancing seriously. But some Kenyans have complained to local media about the quarantine conditions that include shared bathrooms and poor hygiene. Kenya has 126 confirmed cases.

(Associated Press) Brazil health officials grappling with the coronavirus outbreak have issued a stark warning about a lack of hospital beds, masks, testing devices and trained staff across Latin America's largest nation. A report published Friday night said Brazil can currently carry out 6,700 tests a day, but that it will need to process as many as 30,000 to 50,000 tests daily during the peak of the outbreak, expected in June. This latest assessment of the public health-care system raises questions about its capacity to face the outbreak in a country of nearly 210 million. It also calls for the maintenance of quarantine measures in states that are most badly hit, challenging President Jair Bolsonaro's more laid-back approach to the virus. As of Saturday afternoon, the health ministry had reported 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 deaths. But the outbreak is still in its early phase, the report said, and the country's hospitals are not ready to handle a peak. Ecuador's government has begun storing the bodies of victims of the coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers as hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil, the centre of the country's outbreak, have already filled morgues and hospitals. Ecuador has confirmed 318 deaths from the virus, one of the highest tallies in Latin America. 
  On Thursday, the NHL suspended its season over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Women's World Curling Championship in Prince George, B.C., was called off and the MLB suspended spring training and pushed back the start of the baseball season by at least two weeks. The night before, the NBA pulled the plug on its season. Earlier that day, the World Figure Skating Championships in Montreal were put on ice. But organizers say minor hockey across eastern Ontario is going ahead, at least for now, with new measures to keep players and coaches safe.   It's year end for many teams, with local, regional and championship games still scheduled.   The Ottawa East Minor Hockey Association (OEMHA) says it's going ahead with its 2020 March Break tournament this weekend, which includes novice and atom teams travelling from as far away as Nunavut, some of which have forked over as much as $30,000 to take part. No sharing of water bottles and no handshakes. Instead, players will keep their gloves on and bump fists. (Daniel Thomas/CBC) None of that tournament's scheduled games is scheduled to take place at Brewer arena. The rink, located across from Carleton University, has been turned into a COVID-19 testing site, though it's not yet open.    Brewer arena to become coronavirus screening centre    Hockey Eastern Ontario says it's not aware of any cancelled games. It says it's following these guidelines put out by Hockey Canada about how to keep players and coaches healthy.   No handshakes between officials and coaches before games, just a fist bump. Players fist bump with hockey gloves on instead of shaking hands. Make soap and/or hand sanitizer available in dressing rooms and hotels. Gloves should be worn by staff handling towels or laundry. Towels should not be shared on the team bench. Players should not share clothing, bar soap or other personal items such as razors. All players must have their own water bottles. Bottles should be labelled and washed after each practice or game.   Officials should avoid the practice of drinking from the goaltender's water bottle. No sharing of water bottles or towels in the penalty box. Advise players to try not touch their own mouths or noses. Keep players away if they are showing any signs of infectious disease or virus. 
 Clarification: This story was originally published March 4, 2020. Much of what we know about the COVID-19 virus has changed since this interview. The information shared here regarding travel and how to protect yourself should not be considered most up to date but the instructions around hand washing are still useful.   Dr. Zain Chagla, infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton answered, Thursday, your questions and responded to your comments on the coronavirus outbreak. In Canada, public health officials have reported 33 cases of COVID-19. The virus emerged in China late last year and has spread around the world. According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization,  \"about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.\ " Trudeau says 'knee-jerk reactions' won't stop spread of COVID-19 While the Public Health Agency of Canada says the risk is low in Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said it's \"important for each of us to be prepared for all scenarios.\ "  So, how do we prepare? How do we protect ourselves and the people around us? We asked Dr. Chagla. Here's what he had to say. Read below for an abridged and edited version of his Facebook Live interview with CBC's Conrad Collaco or click on the play button above to watch the entire interview.   Dr. Zain Chagla, infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare   When compared to the flu and SARS how serious is this virus? Dr. Chagla: SARS is probably the closest example to this coronavirus. They are cousin viruses. In 2002 SARS infected, not a lot of people, about 3,000 total. But the issue was about a quarter of them did ultimately pass on from the illness. So SARS was a viral infection that, didn't infect a ton, but caused a lot of death. Influenza is kind of the opposite.  We deal with this on a year to year basis. We had, obviously, a very bad year in 2009 with the pandemic influenza. And so the issue with influenza is we have a lot of people infected. Very few actually die but a lot of people come down with the illness. The coronavirus somewhere fits in between.  So, definitely more people infected than the SARS virus of 2002/2003 but much less death than we saw with SARS. What should people be doing to protect themselves? The advice we're giving people is very similar to what we give people in the typical flu season. The way we can track this virus is really by respiratory droplets —  those big droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze or those droplets getting on surfaces and then touching eyes, ears, nose, mouth and getting it into the person that way. Islanders: What to do if you think you have COVID-19 The protection for the average person is the big things of washing your hands regularly, especially when you're touching those high touch surfaces, making sure that if you have to cough or sneeze that you cough and sneeze into your sleeve rather than on your hands where you can transmit it person to person. If you're sick, stay home and avoid infecting the public. So those are the big pieces of advice and stay standard throughout this season regardless of coronavirus. This question comes in from Louise. \"My husband and I are planning a trip to the Maritimes next week. We hoped to drive down and visit for about 10 days. I am concerned whether this is advisable or not? We would be staying at hotels on the way down and then with family in the Maritimes. The trip is not essential. I had hoped to visit family and friends and soak in some of that great salt sea air. Oh, and eat lots of seafood. Would you advise postponing the trip or do you think it would be an overreaction to cancel? That sounds like an incredible experience. There are some concerns around travel and as we know this is a disease where most of our cases in Canada have been related to travel or contacts of those who have traveled.  Outside of Canada the situation is a little bit different. We've seen other countries as close as the United States where there's been some transmission within those communities to people that haven't traveled. So, generally for travel there is a risk that you could acquire the infection, although within Canada I think our situation is pretty stable right now. We haven't seen, in any of our studies, cases coming from the community. So a trip like that to the Maritimes is pretty safe. The other nice part of that trip is getting home isn't that difficult. You're driving out and you're driving back. How to prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak In Iran, China, Italy, South Korea and Japan, not only is the situation evolving and there is a risk of acquiring the infection abroad, but even if the situation changes and things like flights get delayed you know airports are shut down there may be difficulties getting back home. We saw that in some Canadians that were originally stuck in Wuhan. This may evolve in a country during a trip. There are case transmissions ongoing in Spain and France and Germany where we don't know what the situation is going to be like at the end of the week. So, bottom line is I think it's still safe to travel. Be very careful traveling to those zones of the world that are very high risk. Be prepared.  Have patience.  Make sure that you have a stable supply of medications you have trip cancellation and travel insurance. Be prepared that you may have some difficulties coming home. Pregnancy   (Facebook) At this time, very little is known about pregnancy — and a lot inferred from prior SARS and related MERS outbreaks. From the limited data, pregnant women may be at higher risk of becoming ill or going into preterm labour if they were to acquire COVID-19, but this is similar to influenza as well. The risk in Canada is fortunately low, and the most important thing is exercising good hand hygiene. This question comes in from Sue. \"How does someone self isolating in their apartment affect the rest of the people living on that floor, or in the rest of the building? When does self isolation in an apartment building affect the ability of residents in other apts to come and go, when they are without signs or symptoms of infection?\ " So, it's a really good question. I would, first of all, recommend everyone who's interested in what self-isolation looks like, both from the standpoint of the patient or family members, to look at the Public Health Ontario website. Someone who is symptomatic and is diagnosed with coronavirus living in an apartment, they would be told to self isolate at home. If you're doing well like 80 per cent of people you wouldn't think differently than any other season.  'Herd effect': Social media images of empty shelves fuelling panic buying over coronavirus, says prof If there are other people in the apartment it's still safe for them to be around.   The recommendation is the person that has the infection, and even the people in the apartment, wear masks during all their contact. They stay about two meters apart from each other while in the apartment together. This is again a droplet virus. So it doesn't really travel through ventilation, especially the ventilation we see in fairly modern buildings in Hamilton and region. What is being done at St. Joe's to deal with the outbreak? Ontario is very unique in that we dealt with SARS in 2002, really one of the few areas in the world that had to uniquely deal with SARS as part of its pandemic plan. So, we have had a plan in terms of how to deal with emerging infectious diseases for the last 20 years and really we've re updated that plan when we came down to H1N1 in 2009 when Ebola became an issue in West Africa. As Canadians clamour for coronavirus vaccine, many aren't getting immunized against other diseases A hospital is a mix between a ton of departments, clinical services, administrative services, infection control. For the last few weeks we've been really working to make sure all of those services are onboard to map through all of these scenarios so we're very prepared if people come to the emergency room needing to be assessed, if people need to be admitted from the emergency room, if we have a number of patients admitted to hospital. We've made preparations for those scenarios.   We've been sitting down fairly regularly going through the planning of what's happening today and what could happen tomorrow and what the worst case scenario could look like for Hamilton at St. Joe's.   From Johanne Guilbault on Facebook: Can you get re-infected? It's a good question and the answer isn't necessarily out there yet. What's really remarkable about this infection is the amount of scientific literature and progress that's being made in such a short interval for this infection. It is very different than SARS or what was going on with the influenza pandemic in 2009. There are reports of people having the virus a few weeks after originally being diagnosed. It's really unclear whether or not that's a re-infection or it's the person who's just shedding the virus for a long time and whether or not they're even infectious at that point.  The jury is still out on if you could be re infected. The literature will come from China and Singapore and those areas of the world that have been heavily affected as they have more experience with this. Are masks effective? For health care workers assessing patients I think masks are obviously a value. You're dealing with someone that's actively ill.  For people that are caring for infected patients like a household contact in isolation, masks are also pretty effective. In Canada we've only had about 20 cases in a population of 30 million. So, your odds of actually being exposed to one of those cases is probably the same odds as winning the lottery. Wearing a mask everyday, all day isn't necessarily going to offer you more benefit than washing your hands.    Putting a mask on and taking it off is actually not a simple procedure. And as we all know, we touch your face many times a day. If you take your mask off incorrectly and it has actually been exposed to the virus or any other virus that's circulating you're actually taking what's on that surface of that mask and putting it back on your face. You're actually making the problem worse not better. So, again, for the average person they're not really at high risk. Doing things like hand hygiene and really making sure they're not touching their face is probably the biggest intervention for that from a public health standpoint. Making sure we identify cases is probably the other big intervention but wearing a mask around really doesn't reduce your risk  that much and, in fact, if you don't do it properly you might actually increase your risk. From April Almeida on Facebook: Is sanitizer as effective as soap and water washing? When you can't get to a sink, or traveling on plane? So, 20 seconds of hand washing with soap and water or using a hand sanitizer are entirely the same. Good, old fashioned, soap and water is effective. What makes hand hygiene the most effective is doing it properly. So, making sure you touch all those surfaces on your hands and spending the time doing it.  The areas of the hands that get missed, particularly, are these areas behind the thumbs where, if you're scrubbing like that, you're not really touching those areas. So, whatever you use is fine as long as you're doing it properly.   How long do you think it will be until this virus is under control? It's a million dollar question.  We're not near control today. Most of our federal agencies including the Health Minister, yesterday, had said you know there is a good eventuality that this may come to Canada and that we need to be prepared for it. In China, about two or three weeks ago, we were reporting 800 to 1,000 new cases a day. If you look at the stats from yesterday there was 115 new cases reported. It's a significant drop off in China. So, there are signs of positivity. So I think it's gonna be an interesting couple of months to see what happens. But the scenario is there are some signs that the scenarios are getting better.

  The number of coronavirus cases outside of China is growing. With more than 260 confirmed cases, Italy now has the highest number of reported cases outside of Asia.   Most are in the Lombardy region, of which Milan is the capital. That happens to be where Weyburn's Kate Andrews, 28, is studying for her master's degree. On Monday, she got an email from her school that all classes and activities would be suspended for a week. The University of Bocconi said it was a decision made by all universities in the region with recommendation from the Ministry of Health. In a statement, the universities said everything will be back to normal on March 2, unless authorities advise otherwise.    The novel coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing around 2,700 deaths, mainly in China. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it. About a dozen towns in Italy are effectively under lockdown and ten people have died of the virus.   Andrews said many people in Milan are wearing masks and grocery store shelves are being stripped bare. Public events have been cancelled and Milan's cathedral is closed to tourists. Andrew, second from right, is from Weyburn but has been living in Milan since January and attending the University of Bocconi.   (Submitted by Kate Andrews) She said residents haven't been given much instruction, other than to self-isolate if they've been to areas of Italy currently facing an outbreak. \"There might be a little bit of panicking going on,\" she said. \"It seems that people want to be prepared just in case things escalate. \"And we don't really know what could happen so I guess that's probably the reason for trying to stock up on things.\ " Andrews said she is considering coming back to Canada but hasn't made definite plans. She said she doesn't want to end up trapped like some students in China. \"That would be very, very difficult and I can't imagine what that must be like. I guess for my specific situation I'm hopeful that it doesn't escalate to that point, but ... you never know.\ " Andrews says people all over Milan are wearing face masks in hopes of protecting themselves from coronavirus. Some are makeshift masks, like the one shown.   (Submitted by Kate Andrews) The Government of Canada put out a notice on COVID-19 in Italy on Tuesday. \"If you travel to Italy, take precautions against respiratory and other illnesses, and seek medical attention if you become sick,\ " the website says. The Public Health Agency of Canada has rated the risk in Italy a Level 2, meaning travellers should practise special health precautions. Notices at this level are issued if there is an outbreak in a limited area. In Canada, there are 11 confirmed cases of COVID-19. So far there are none in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) says protocol is unchanged. Anyone who has travelled from the Hubei province of China that includes Wuhan, China, needs to self-isolate for 14 days. There are no quarantine guidelines for those returning from Italy.   The SHA said the risk of COVID-19 to Canadians remains low.  
  After the sixth straight day of no new COVID-19 cases in New Brunswick, the provincial government moved Friday to open up the outdoors and allow people to see a select group outside their own household. Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health, said testing and contact tracing will continue across the province, and people must continue to practise physical distancing and frequent handwashing. \"I will not hesitate to recommend the re-imposition of the restrictions being loosened today if the outbreak worsens,\" said Russell. \"Any significant acceleration of the disease curve will trigger a new round of restrictions to public movement and activity.\ " But the four-phase recovery plan begins immediately, allowing \"two-family bubbles\" to meet with one another, Premier Blaine Higgs said at the daily coronavirus briefing. Despite the \"family\" in the description, the looser rule applies to households, even if its members aren't related. Outdoor spaces, such as parks and beaches, and golf courses, will also open immediately, along with fishing and hunting seasons, car pooling, \"drive-in\" religious services and post-secondary education, starting with \"practical programs,\" he told reporters during the daily briefing in Fredericton. If physical distancing is difficult to maintain, Russell recommended residents wear community face masks. Organizations and businesses can require customers to wear face masks. There have been 118 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick. (CBC News) \"I support this and any other measures that businesses and organizations decide to take to prevent further spread of the virus,\ " Russell said. Reopening of gathering places, organized sports and bars are \"yet to be determined.\ " But large festivals and concerts are still prohibited through to Dec. 31, but Higgs said this is subject to change. \"With the knowledge we have today of the virus and how it spreads it would not be appropriate for us to suggest that we were to do anything other than to prevent mass gatherings and to ensure we didn't have a huge breakout in our community and our province,\ " Higgs said.   The news conference announcing the steps toward recovery included three other party leaders in addition to Higgs, including Liberal Kevin Vickers, David Coon of the Green Party and Kris Austin of the People's Alliance. All three opposition leaders, members of the all-party cabinet committee that approved the decisions about reopening, said they supported banning large events in New Brunswick for the rest of the year. First steps of recovery plan for New Brunswick announced by Premier Blaine Higgs on Friday. 3:18 But Coon stressed the province needs measures to support businesses, musicians and athletes who will be hurt by this. And the province needs to find a way \"to do things differently.\"   \"There are those businesses and pastimes that depend on large gatherings of people tightly packed together and with this virus, it doesn't permit that,\ " Coon said.   Here's a roundup of other developments.   11 active cases of COVID-19   Out of the 118 confirmed cases of COVID-19, there are still 11 active cases, including four people in hospital, one of whom is in intensive care, chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell announced. To date, a total of 107 people have recovered from the respiratory illness, she said. The province has been under a state of emergency since March 19 because of the pandemic. New Brunswick could open border with P.E.I. Under the recovery plan announced Friday, New Brunswick will still have to keep its borders closed, and Premier Blaine Higgs suggested the province may even further restrict movement at the border. \"We need to know exactly where they're going, why they're going, and if it's necessary,\" said Higgs. Higgs spoke with Premier Dennis King about \"pending things\" the two provinces could open together.   P.E.I.'s chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison said Friday that of the Island's 26 cases of COVID-19, 24 are considered recovered. The last time a new case was announced was April 15. Higgs said if the situation remains comparable between the two province, it is possible New Brunswick could reopen its  border with P.E.I., but will keep it closed for now. Testing will continue to evolve  As restriction loosen up, testing for COVID-19 will continue and the criteria for it will continue to evolve, Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical health officer says. The province now will test if a person has two of the five symptoms of COVID-19, but over a longer period of time, this could drop to one symptom, she said.   She said testing is still happening in hospitals and emergency departments. And a rapid response team has also been put in place to test New Brunswick's vulnerable population or people who work in nursing homes. And once long-term supplies and technology becomes more available, Russell said, the province will move into testing on a larger scale. She also expects there will also be serum testing for antibodies in people who have already had the disease.   The province has tested a total of 12,418 people for COVID-19. Russell has said that the data to give an accurate picture of the disease in New Brunswick, Public Health has to keep up the same pace of testing. Federal government offers rent subsidies   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced a new rent subsidy program to help businesses forced to shut down due to the global pandemic, as some provinces, including New Brunswick, begin to lay out plans to reopen their economies. The rent relief plan, to be funded jointly with the provinces, will provide non-repayable loans to commercial property owners to cover 50 per cent of rent payments for April, May and June. Most businesses have closed across New Brunswick, including The Abbey Café & Gallery in Fredericton. (Photo: Mike Heenan/CBC News) Premier Blaine Higgs said New Brunswick will take part in the program.   \"We will continue to evaluate each business to ensure that the right measures go in the right place,\ " he said.   Premier believes New Brunswick will recover Premier Blaine Higgs was upbeat Friday about the province's ability to recover and said business and government have learned valuable lessons, including some about streamlining, because of their response to the outbreak. \"In a nutshell, it's starting to take advantage of what we love here in New Brunswick about our wide open spaces,\ " he said.   COVID-19 creates food supply 'challenges' in New Brunswick, raises food security concerns   Many aspects of economic life in the province have been shut down and people have been staying mostly at home since March 19, when Higgs declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 outbreak.   Shediac lobster Festival cancelled The Shediac Lobster Festival announced the cancellation of the five day event in July—the same day Higgs announced that large gatherings would be put on hold until the end of the year.   \"The organization supports the Government of New Brunswick's recommendations and urges you to follow the suggested guidelines so that we can start planning again for the festival that is so important to us all,\" the Shediac Lobster Festival said in a news release.   Camps in province plan for a different summer   This would've been the festival's 71st anniversary. \"The team will be ready and looks forward to greeting you in 2021.\ " Province wants to bring back elective surgeries Last month Horizon Health and Vitalité health networks reduced surgical access, except for urgent procedures such as limb-saving and cancer surgeries.   Premier Blaine Higgs said Friday that he's looking at opening operating rooms for eight to 12 hours a day and possibly for 24 hours a day, so people won't have to wait as long for procedures that were delayed by COVD-19.   N.B. government eliminates 30-day cap on prescription refills  \"We're looking at the whole system understanding what's the backlog that's been created even more so because of covid-19.\ " Higgs doesn't want residents to pay more tax Premier Blaine Higgs made it clear Friday morning that he did not want New Brunswickers to pay more taxes following the COVID-19 outbreak. \"I think the last thing that we need for the average citizen and people trying to make a living here is to pay more taxes,\ " he said.   Businesses counting on tourism look to 'staycationers' to fill void   The province is working alongside local businesses to help them reopen, while looking at their protocol. Higgs also spoke with federal Tourism Minister  Mélanie  Joly this week about a tourism package and how to help businesses recover in that particular sector.   Conservation Council recommends more local food security as part of COVID-19 recovery plan   April is the first month of the province's new fiscal year —  and it's already run into a financial deficit.   Higgs has said for weeks he will worry about the province's finances after the threat from COVID-19 passes but has acknowledged restarting the economy and solving the fiscal problem the virus leaves behind will be daunting. Premier Blaine Higgs told business owners this week to start getting ready to re-open. He says the province will open up in stages, while maintaining public health requirements. 21:25 He said businesses will need to find a new way to operate in what is \"the new normal\" following COVID-19, perhaps including more working at home.    \"At this stage I'm not foreseeing new taxes because I don't think that's going to help our economy grow.\ " What to do if you have symptoms People concerned they might have COVID-19 can take a self-assessment on the government website. Symptoms of coronavirus include fever, a new or worsening cough, and breathlessness, as well as sore throat, headache and runny nose. People with two of those symptoms are asked to:   Stay at home.    Immediately call Tele-Care 811 or their doctor   Describe symptoms and travel history.    Follow instructions. 
  Premier Blaine Higgs used his daily COVID-19 briefing Monday to tackle some confusion surrounding the provincial plan for recovery from the harsh impact of the pandemic. \"Over the weekend we received 758 calls — up from 617 calls during the previous weekend,\ " he said. \"The calls we have receiving were from residents who have a range of questions and concerns.\ " Here are the areas of confusion the premier and Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical health officer, addressed Monday Masks: mandatory or not? Not yet. In parts of the graphic distributed by the province Friday, the current salmon-coloured phase and the next two, orange and yellow, masks are \"required unless unable.\ " This seemed to be a stricter rule than the red phase of complete shutdown, when masks were \"strongly recommended.\ " But on Monday, Russell addressed this, saying that when physical distancing measures are loosened even further to allow gatherings in two to four weeks, masks could become mandatory in settings where it is impossible to maintain a proper distance.   \"Our recommendation for now is to give the public enough time to buy or to make their own masks,\ " Russell said. \"It is possible in the coming weeks that it will become mandatory.\" COVID-19 will be with us for a long time, before a vaccine or other treatment becomes available, Dr. Jennifer Russell said Monday. 1:40 The mask provision will be extremely important in businesses or shops once they reopen. \"It's very important that you get used to wearing masks,\ " Russell said. The \"unless unable\" stipulation means masks won't be mandatory for children or people who have health issues preventing them from wearing a mask comfortably. Chief medical officer Dr. Jennifer Russell said masks could become mandatory in the next two to four weeks in areas where physical distancing is not possible such as in shops. (Submitted by Government of New Brunswick) These masks can be homemade from cloth and don't have to be medical masks. Officials previously warned against hoarding medical and surgical masks, because that could cause a shortage for health-care workers. ATVs, snowmobiles and trails Last week ATV trails were closed, reopened for two days, then closed again after Higgs said he was \"disappointed\" with the reopening. Under the new looser restrictions, Higgs clarified Monday, snowmobile and ATV trails are still closed. But people are permitted to ride their ATVs and snowmobiles. \"I think the point of the trails being officially closed is that people are not taking a large group and they're not going to a cookout somewhere and having a major afternoon event,\ " Higgs said. Premier Blaine Higgs said people are allowed to ride their ATVs, but not to gather in large groups with other ATV riders. (CBC)   \"We need to make sure that we just do not get together at a gathering place.\ " He said the people need to \"use their common sense.\" Higgs previously said trails would be closed for another two to four weeks, maybe longer. Quad NB president Roger Daigle confirmed the club-managed trails are still closed. But some people could still be riding on wood roads or Crown land, not regulated by his organization \"You can go in with your ATV or dirt bike or truck or car,\ " he said. \"I don't know if we're being ... put under the gun for us to close our trails, but everything else stays open.\" Demographics, distancing and dumb luck: How N.B. avoided a worst-case COVID-19 scenarioN.B. COVID-19 roundup: No new cases for 9th straight day, but province isn't ready to 'declare victory' Daigle said almost 50 per cent of people who have ATVs don't belong to any clubs, and ride on Crown land or forest trails. Higgs said this is allowed as long as they don't gather. Ross Antworth, general manager with the New Brunswick Federation of Snowmobile Clubs, said their trails have been closed since late March. He said people can still snowmobile on crown land or forest roads as well, and he has heard of people gathering. Higgs said the province is willing to ticket people who break social distancing rules. Are universities open? Higgs said universities are only open for students who need to have in-person practical classes, and they must maintain  a proper distance from each other. In response to a request for an interview, University of New Brunswick directed CBC to a statement on its website. The statement said UNB campuses are not reopening for academic purposes and remain closed to the public. Reopening ATV trails was 'bad decision' that will be reversed, QuadNB says Campuses have been closed for everything but essential services since mid-March. The statement said the reopening will only apply to academic programs Russell has deemed essential and will be limited to programs that involve a practical or lab component. The university will develop strict criteria and safety measures before it reopens any classes, the statement said. The university is still working on that plan. Parks and playgrounds Higgs said while parks can reopen, all playgrounds are closed, including municipal, provincial and school playgrounds. The City of Moncton made a social media post reminding people of this and saying people have removed municipal signs.   \"We have received reports that individuals have been seen taking down signage and yellow caution tape in our playgrounds,\ " the city said. \"This is not permitted and residents should never take down signage in any municipal facility.\"
  Recent developments:  Two more people have died of COVID-19 in Ottawa. The prime minister says physical distancing is the new normal until there's a vaccine. More than a million Canadians lost their jobs in March. CBC Ottawa has an often-updated Facebook page dedicated to feel-good, local stories.

Federal experts project 11,000 to 22,000 deaths across Canada from COVID-19, even with strong restrictions in place. They say it's too early to predict when the peak in transmission will come. How many cases do we have? There are 458 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa and more than 850 in eastern Ontario and western Quebec. The deaths of at least 11 people in Leeds, Grenville and Lanark counties, nine people in Ottawa and two more in the wider region have been tied to COVID-19.     From what we know, more than 200 people in the region have recovered. Some local health units don't share this number. Confirmed cases are just a snapshot because of the limits of testing. There are likely thousands more.

  Premier François Legault announced the first death in Quebec from COVID-19: an elderly person in the Lanaudière region.   There are 94 confirmed cases in Quebec, up from 50 on Monday. Four people are in intensive care. Call 1-877-644-4545 if you think you have COVID-19 symptoms instead of 811. Quebec's director of public health, Dr. Horacio Arruda, is asking Quebecers not to wear masks. He said it does not prevent the spread of COVID-19, and masks should be reserved for health care workers. Someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19 took a shuttle from the airport to an airport parking lot on March 8. Canada and the United States will close the border to non-essential travel while allowing some commercial traffic to continue. Air Transat and Porter are suspending flights.    A first person in Quebec has died from the novel coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to jump, but authorities urged Quebecers not to despair, saying the health care network is ready. The person who died was an elderly woman living in a seniors' residence in the Lanaudière region. She had been in contact with someone who had travelled, said Quebec's director of public health, Dr. Horacio Arruda. Public health officials have launched an investigation to trace everyone who had been in contact her, and the residence where she had been living has been notified. Even though the woman did not contract the disease abroad, Arruda said her case alone doesn't indicate the onset of community transmission of the disease — a critical marker for public health officials tracking its evolution. \"We're not there yet,\ " Arruda said, specifying that community transmission requires the disease to be spreading at three degrees of separation (known as generations) from someone who caught it abroad.   In all, nine people have died in Canada from COVID-19: seven in British Columbia and one in Ontario.  In Italy, considered the hardest-hit area after China, the disease is responsible for nearly 3,000 deaths.    Along with the death, Quebec authorities also announced that the number of confirmed cases in the province has risen to 94. Of those, six people are in hospital — four of them in intensive care.   The Quebec government is now asking people not to wear masks for prevention purposes, as it could cause a shortage.   (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) Arruda called on Quebecers not to be dismayed by the numbers. \"Just because the numbers are increasing doesn't mean it's time to give up,\ " he said Wednesday at the government's daily news conference in Quebec City.   He said it's still too early to determine the impact of government-imposed social-distancing measures — such closing schools and bars. It will take another week before a fair assessment is possible.   The effectiveness of those measures will also depend on how many people take seriously the directives that are more difficult to enforce, he said, such as advising people over 70 to stay at home and encouraging everyone in the province to avoid social gatherings. Trudeau unveils $82B COVID-19 emergency response package for Canadians, businesses \"If there are more cases tomorrow than today, that doesn't mean we're losing the battle,\" Arruda said. \"The measures we put in place are very demanding. We know. But they are still necessary.\" Arruda said, if anything, people should be increasing their safety precautions, such as not using cash and ordering online whenever possible. Legault thanks social media influencers Also speaking at Wednesday's news conference, Premier François Legault and Health Minister Danielle McCann provided updates on the health care resources in place to test and treat patients.   The province is currently testing around 3,000 people daily. That number will increase to 5,000 by Friday, they said. Quebec currently has 2,300 hospital beds ready to treat COVID-19 patients, and plans are in the works to make available as many as 6,000.

Goods will still be allowed to cross.   \"Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \"In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home.\ " Ottawa also announced a wide range of financial measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the outbreak. They include a relaxing of the deadline to file federal taxes, emergency payments for people in isolation and payroll subsidies to businesses. AnalysisHere's what's behind Premier François Legault's confident leadership in this COVID-19 crisis All together, Trudeau valued the measures at $82 billion. They are in addition to several emergency programs already announced by the Quebec government aimed at individuals and businesses.   Meanwhile, in Quebec, stores and businesses continued Wednesday to reduce operations. The grocery store chains IGA, Provigo and Maxi will be closing at 8 p.m., Radio-Canada is reporting. The liquor commission, the SAQ, will also reduce hours at its outlets. Air Transat, which is based in Montreal, announced it is gradually suspending all flights as a result of travel restrictions. Sales for departures until April 30 are suspended immediately to most destinations in Europe and the United States. Sales to the Caribbean and Mexico are also suspended. Repatriation flights, however, will continue for the next two weeks.  People can still buy flights to or from Montreal and Lisbon or Paris, in order to get customers back to their home countries. The company said a \"full halt\" date will be announced soon. Porter also announced it was suspending its flights as of Friday, March 20. Service is currently expected to resume June 1. 
  Local coffee shop owners say they don't plan to ban reusable coffee mugs and containers the way some big coffee companies have in response to coronavirus fears, because they don't think will do much to slow the spread of the virus.   Starbucks, the Second Cup and Tim Hortons announced this week they are temporarily forbidding customers from bringing their own reusable mugs because of fears that could help spread COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that has so far infected almost 100,000 people around the world and killed more than 2,000. There have been no deaths in Canada connected with COVID-19 and Manitoba's top doctor has repeately said the risk of getting COVID-19 remains low for people in  Manitoba.​​ Bulk Barn said it's also going to put a hold on its program that lets people fill up using their own jars. But Katrina Tessier, owner of Scout Coffee and Tea in Winnipeg, said she thinks the move is an overreaction. Nearly 100 Manitobans tested, but no confirmed cases of coronavirus, says chief provincial health officerFears of coronavirus contamination prompt coffee chains to temporarily ban reusable mugs \"At this point, it's not something we're going to be considering here,\ " she said.   When mugs are filled at her coffee shop, the mugs don't usually touch their equipment at all, she said. \"So for me , I don't think that there is any concern at this point,\ " she said — but she doesn't think it would make much difference regardless. \"Going out in any public space, you're risking the chance of touching germs,\ " she said. \"With Starbucks, if that person has that sickness and they cough on the napkin dispenser, you're still going to get it, right? So I think the biggest thing is if you're sick, just stay home.\ " Tessier says mugs usually don't even touch the equipment at her coffee shop.   (Warren Kay/CBC) Louis Lévesque Côté, manager and co-owner of Café Postal in St. Boniface, said he can see the rationale behind large coffee chains deciding to ban reusable mugs because they have locations all over the world. Given that there haven't been any cases of coronavirus reported in Manitoba, he doesn't see the need for local coffee shops to do the same.   He also said he didn't think it would make much of a difference in preventing the spread of the virus, since mugs are usually rinsed out with hot water.   \"I'm not sure if it's a really effective way of slowing the spread of the virus, especially in Manitoba.\" Starbucks stores got the order to stop using reusable cups on Wednesday and by Thursday morning signs such as this one were visible in stores advising consumers of the move. (Pete Evans/CBC) Manitoba's chief public health officer said Thursday that 97 people in the province had been tested for coronavirus, but no one had been diagnosed with it.   Dr. Brent Roussin also said people should properly wash their hands to avoid contracting or spreading the virus and wearing masks has no benefit for people who aren't showing symptoms. \"Soap and water is our best bet,\ " he said. \"The big take-home message is frequent handwashing, staying home when you're sick, staying away from others who are showing those symptoms. These are very basic measures, but they've been shown over and over again to work.\"
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is due to receive a shipment of \"millions of masks\" in the coming days, as a major medical device manufacturer remains under continued pressure from the United States to cease its exports of similar protective equipment.   \"We're working around the clock to get Canada the resources we need,\ " Trudeau said during his daily address to Canadians Saturday. \"In the next 48 hours, we will be receiving a shipment of millions of masks by a chartered cargo flight. We are also working with provinces to transport their medical supplies when possible.\ " A spokesperson for Procurement Minister Anita Anand confirmed to CBC News that the plane would be travelling from China bearing millions of surgical masks, as well as other supplies intended for Quebec-based companies.   The news comes as Minnesota-based company 3M revealed Friday that because of the Trump administration's invocation of the Defence Production Act — which allows the president to boost industrial production of critically needed goods — the manufacturer is under orders not to send U.S.-made N95 masks to other countries, including Canada.   In a statement, 3M said that halting such exports could adversely affect America's own supply if other countries choose to retaliate, prompting President Donald Trump to reveal that his administration was \"not at all happy\" with the company. Ottawa looks to Kushner, other U.S. trade officials to resolve medical equipment dispute3M faces pressure from Trump order to stop exporting N95 masks to CanadaUpdatedFight over N95 masks shows Trump testing ethical, legal limits in COVID-19 crisis Trudeau addressed the dispute during his Friday briefing, stating that failing to send supplies destined for Canada \"could end up hurting Americans as much as it hurts anybody else.\ "  But the prime minister said Saturday that he wasn't seeking retaliatory measures against the U.S. — such as blocking Canadian nurses from Windsor, Ont., from travelling across the American border to work in Detroit. \"We are not looking at retaliatory measures or measures that are punitive.  We know that it is in both of our interests to continue to work collaboratively and co-operatively,\ " Trudeau said. He added that his government is \"continuing to engage in constructive discussions with different levels within the [Trump] administration\" to preserve the flow of goods and services across U.S.-Canada border. Watch: Trudeau says Canada won't retaliate against the U.S. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that he was not seeking punitive measures against the U.S. after the White House said it would stop exporting face masks outside the country. 0:21 Canada setting sights on domestic manufacturers Only surgical masks — rather than the N95 masks at the centre of the 3M dispute — will be on board the plane from China, Anand's office said. The federal government said earlier this week it had already ordered 65 million N95 masks, which provide a higher degree of protection against COVID-19 than the ones coming from China. The prime minister said that the federal government has now \"leased a warehouse in China\" to collect and distribute supplies more efficiently. \"We are  also turning towards Canadian manufacturers [given] the tremendous effort that Canadian companies are putting in to develop made-in-Canada products, PPE and medical supplies,\ " Trudeau said, mentioning that those supplies could also be sent to other countries who need them. Ontario Premier Doug Ford asked Health Canada Saturday to expedite the approval process that would allow local companies to start producing the necessary supplies. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Saturday that Canada and the U.S. have a relationship reminiscent of \"one big family,\" but said that the White House has \"cut out one part of the family now.\" (Evan Mitsui) \"I can't stand relying on other countries or other leaders when we have the capabilities right here in Ontario,\" he said.  \"We just need to get these approvals going.\" Ford added that Canada's dispute with the U.S. over the export restrictions had soured his view of a country he greatly admires. \"It shouldn't come down to this. We have a thousand nurses leaving Ontario that we're in desperate need [of] going to help Americans.\" Dispute comes as stark provincial projections released Concerns over Canada's stock of medical goods and protective equipment come as projections of COVID-19's spread in the province of Ontario were revealed on Friday. Provincial health experts predict the virus could take the lives of 3,000 to 15,000 Ontarians over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, which could last for 18 months to two years. \"Had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, who leads Public Health Ontario. \"Thankfully, that is not the position we are in.\ " The projections also indicated that in Ontario, COVID-19 has a 16 per cent mortality rate for people over the age of 80 — just below global levels of around 20 per cent. Both Alberta and Quebec are expected to release their projections next week. Also included in Trudeau's Saturday briefing were additional details about the federal government's plan for vulnerable Canadians, including a previously-announced $40 million for women's shelters and sexual assault centres and $10 million for Indigenous women and children fleeing violence.   The prime minister said that communities set to receive the funding had been identified and will now be receiving aid.  
  An intensive care doctor in Toronto is pleading with political leaders to take bold steps now to impose a lockdown, warning that Ontario's health system could face \"total collapse\" if the spread of COVID-19 is not slowed.   Dr. Michael Warner is medical director of the intensive care unit (ICU) at Michael Garron Hospital and chairs the critical care section of the Ontario Medical Association.   \"It's World War Three,\ " Warner said in an interview with CBC News. \"This could be an unmitigated disaster. This is the time to overreact. If I'm wrong, that's great, but at least we're prepared. But if I'm not wrong, then we're in major trouble.\"   The number of new coronavirus cases in Ontario has grown by an average of 21 per cent daily over the past week. That means the total number of cases is doubling every four days, and if that rate of growth were to continue, Ontario's 2,053 ICU beds stand to run out by mid-to-late April.   \"We should expect a massive influx of COVID-19 patients into our hospitals, both ill and critically ill,\" said Warner.   \"We have to be prepared for the worst case scenario,\" he added.   \"This is the time to overreact to what potentially could happen, not to hope for the best.\ " Dr. Michael Warner is the medical director of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital and says Canada should have enforced a mandatory lockdown from coast to coast a while ago. 6:25 Warner is calling for \"social distancing without exception\" and urging political leaders and public health officials to impose stricter measures to slow the spread of the virus.   \"If we don't, the impact on the health care system could be total collapse,\ " he said, urging mandatory lockdowns to be put in place immediately.   How Ontario hospitals are preparing for a surge in COVID-19 casesOntario could run out of ICU beds, ventilators in 37 days even if COVID-19 rates cut in half: study \"If we do it sooner the long term pain will be less,\" said Warner. \"I don't think it's too late to institute those rules, but time is running out.\"   In Italy, COVID-19 has overwhelmed the health system and has killed 5,000 people. New reports coming from New York, San Francisco and Seattle suggest hospitals have begun to see surges in patients.   \"We've learned from the experience in Italy that once it gets out of control the whole health care system is going to be under siege,\" said Warner. \"The patients who get sick with COVID-19 have very, very severe illness, not kind of a flu-light, but very, heavy severe ICU illness that requires sophisticated [medical] techniques.\"  Cancelling scheduled surgeries, as many Ontario hospitals are now doing, can help free some beds on regular wards but does little to relieve the pressure in the critical care wards, says Warner. Heart attacks, strokes, car crashes, overdoses and major infectious diseases that are not COVID-19 will continue to happen.     Warner takes little solace from the announcements from Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott that the province has obtained 300 more ventilators and from Premier Doug Ford that auto parts manufacturers are retooling to build more.   \"It's nice to hear that 300 new ventilators have been purchased,\" said Warner  Ontarians told to 'lock down' to prevent further community spread of COVID-19COVID-19: What's happening in Ontario on Saturday   \"It's like saying, 'We need 10,000 people to have heart surgery, we're going to make a bunch of operating rooms equipped with the heart-lung machines, but we're not going to have any more heart surgeons.'\ "   There are about 400 ICU doctors in Ontario and Warner points out that each one cannot work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   Equipment such as masks, gowns and gloves to protect hospital workers from the COVID-19 virus is in short supply. Warner says some Toronto-area hospitals \"will definitely run out of\" that material within weeks, based on the current inventory and the rate it's being used.   \"What happens if half the ICU doctors get sick or in quarantine?\" he asked. \"Who's going to take care of the patients? Let alone the nurses who actually do all the heavy lifting.\"  Pedestrians wear masks in Toronto as residents engage in social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Warner is calling on Critical Care Services Ontario, a Ministry of Health organization, to create rapid education programs — what he describes as \"a crash course in how to be an ICU doctor\" — for other specialist physicians, such as cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists.   \"We need to get ahead of this. We need to think about the next steps, field hospitals, using airports, stadiums as potential places to take care of patients.\" THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 21Second OpinionWhy mass COVID-19 testing is key to stopping spread   Warner says he's infuriated by unclear and inconsistent messaging about social distancing, leading to instances such as in Toronto on Friday where people formed lengthy lines buy a new video game. He believes the spread of the virus will not be slowed unless the average person heeds the right message.   \"The safest number to congregate in is one. Not 50, not 10 , it's one,\" said Warner. \"Until the government, public health officials and policymakers are consistent with that message then the public will remain confused.\ "  Foresees 'deluge of patients' unless things change If the rate of growth of new infections is not slowed, Warner predicts \"a deluge of patients coming to hospitals in Canada all at the same time. There's no system on earth that can handle that.\ "      He said he is trying to get his message out through as many media interviews as possible this weekend.   \"No amount of time or preparation could make us ready for what could be coming in the days or weeks ahead,\" said Warner.   \"I'm trying to scream as loud as I can about this before I go to work on Monday, because once I go to work on Monday, I may not come out for four months.\" 
  The Ontario Ministry of Health says it's working with the makers of medical masks to address shortage concerns by dentists in light of the new coronavirus outbreak. A memo sent to the provincial regulator for dentistry says it's aware there's a backlog for some orders of personal protective equipment, which dentists need to wear during any routine dental procedure. But it says the ministry is working with health sector partners — manufacturers and supply chain organizations — to ensure critical shortages are addressed. Despite advice from Canadian health authorities that masks are not effective for healthy people, fear of the novel coronavirus dubbed COVID-19 that's rapidly spreading in China has prompted a rush from the public to stockpile the protective gear. Earlier this week federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters that Canada does have a stockpile of masks for domestic use and her department is monitoring the rumblings of a supply chain shortage. Suppliers 'putting measures in place' to stop hoarding Aaron Burry of the Canadian Dental Association says because of concerns raised by dentists, it has contacted distributors of masks, gloves and other protective equipment. He says suppliers are being \"cautious\" and \"putting measures in place\" to control the availability of these products and to prevent stockpiling. But Burry has acknowledged he's heard about some supply problems and says he has been told that boxes of masks have been stolen from dental waiting rooms. Why doctors find fighting the coronavirus so challengingWhat we know so far about the coronavirus For a routine dental cleaning or a simple filling, a dentist and hygienist must wear gloves, a mask, a gown or protective clothing and protective eye wear. For more invasive procedures, there are additional precautions and gloves and masks must be changed between each patient and should also be changed if compromised. 
  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.

For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask?

A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  As social distancing separates people from their friends and family, Albertans are increasingly looking online for companionship and conversation. And scammers are taking advantage of the situation, warns a detective with the Edmonton Police Service. Fraudsters are opportunistic criminals and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it easier for criminals to extract money and personal information from their victims, Det. Linda Herczeg said Wednesday. Scammers, who often use sick family members as an excuse to plead for money, now have a new reason for never meeting their victims face-to-face. \"The coronavirus is not just necessarily the medical piece,\" said Herczeg. \"People are pulling that excuse into not meeting people. ' Honey, I love you but I can't meet you because I am self-isolating.' The believability of it becomes just a little more.\" $1.7 M lost to romance scams since Jan. 1 The increase in criminal activity is especially apparent in romance fraud, where con artists use internet dating sites to troll for victims, profess love, then use the relationship to dupe their mark out of money.   Since Jan. 1, Edmonton police have investigated 21 romance scams that have cost victims a total of $1.7 million, Herczeg said. That's about half of the total losses reported for romance scams in all of last year, she said. The increase in romance scams linked to coronavirus seems to be happening around the world. Herczeg said she is hearing similar anecdotes from police colleagues working internationally. Scammers often call and message their victims dozens of times each day, and lonely people are especially vulnerable, she said.   \"You feel a part of something and you feel somebody cares,\ " she said. \"And that's why people fall victim to those types of scams.\ " Other scams related to the pandemic include online sales of sought-after items like hand-sanitizer and face masks, Herczeg said. \"They're going door to door, they're selling self-test kits. We have people who are buying up sanitizers and whatever they can get their hands on and then they're reselling it on online websites,\ " she said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. Don't fall for free face masks \"There's the free masks that you can get — they're sending through text or they're sending them through email with hyperlinks. Of course, the hyperlinks typically have malware behind them or they're phishing for your personal information so they can get into your banking.\" One Edmontonian who reported such a scam lost about $240 trying to buy face masks from a fraudulent site, Herczeg said. She stressed that if you are ever in doubt about a phone call or digital message, disconnect and seek verification. If you believe you have been scammed, report it to police.   Many people believe that scams are coming from overseas and don't bother reporting attempts to police but Herzceg said that's not the case.   \"A lot of people dismiss them because they think they're overseas and there's nothing that the police can do about it, but a lot of them are domestic.\" Tech issues temporarily halt applications for Alberta COVID-19 emergency isolation funding'We did it right:' COVID-19 scare at oilsands work camp tests businesses' plans
  The demand for hand sanitizer and face masks has left all the Shoppers Drug Mart locations in Winnipeg, among many other stores, out of stock. While no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Manitoba, customers are flooding the stores in search of precautionary measures during the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus. \"My understanding  … is that there have been some shortages when it comes to things like facial masks and hand sanitizer,\ " provincial Health Minister Cameron Friesen​​​​​ said during a Tuesday press conference. Many Walmart locations across the city are also sold out of face masks, and those with stock of hand sanitizer are limiting quantities to one or two bottles per customer.   With high demand for masks and alcohol-based sanitizers online, classified ads have popped up on Kijiji, advertising inflated prices for the products.   Some ads are asking upwards of $150 for 10 face masks.    Ads on Kijiji provide sellers with products unavailable at stores for a heavy premium. (CBC) CBC reached out to the posters of several of the ads, all of whom declined to comment.   Licensed pharmacist Ryan Chan, though, urges Manitobans not to race to stores — but to simply continue washing their hands thoroughly.   Hand-washing is still one of the best ways to prevent the spread of viruses, he says.

  Ontario health officials have confirmed a new case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the fourth in the province since the global outbreak began late last year. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, and Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, spoke to media at Queen's Park following word of a new presumptive case over the weekend. De Villa said during the news conference that a woman in her 20s arrived in Canada from China on Friday and went to North York General Hospital in Toronto with an intermittent cough. She had travelled to the epicentre of the virus in January. \"In that travel to China , we know it did include some travel to Hubei province and to Wuhan in particular,\ " she said, referring to the Chinese province and city where the virus first emerged late last year. De Villa said the woman was tested for the new virus and was sent home for self-isolation because her symptoms were \"resolving\"  and she was doing \"quite well.\ " Officials said the woman's local tests came back positive for the virus on Sunday. A sample was sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg and, after Monday's news conference ended, officials learned that it came back positive. Patient has had 'very, very limited exposure to others' Since arriving in Toronto, de Villa said the woman has had \"very, very limited exposure to others.\" \"Our staff at Toronto Public Health [is] following up directly to connect with this individual on a very regular basis and we are monitoring her symptoms,\ " she said.   De Villa said they will be monitoring a family member who drove the infected individual from the airport to her home. The family member was wearing a mask during their interaction, Williams said.   New presumptive case of novel coronavirus in Toronto, health officials say Officials said the province is co-ordinating with local public health units to ensure that they will contact and monitor passengers who sat close to the woman on the plane. De Villa said the current research advises the agency follow up with people who sat up to two seats away in all directions from the infected individual. System to manage spread of virus 'working' This is the province's fourth case and the third in Toronto, however health officials said the process put in place to manage the spread of the virus is working well. \"The whole process that has been followed from start to finish here shows that, in fact, the system is working quite well to keep people safe,\ " de Villa said. She said the patient was able to identify her symptoms and travel history to officials, staff followed the appropriate precautions and the patient wore a mask and limited her exposure to others.   \"At this time, the risk here in Toronto continues to be low,\" she said.   On top of the three resolved cases and the most recent positive case, Yaffe said nine cases are still under investigation in Ontario and there have been 540 negative tests.   Ontario's first three cases 'resolved' According to the province, Ontario's first three cases of the new coronavirus are all \"resolved,\" which means each of those patients has had two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

China and South Korea on Tuesday reported more cases of a new viral illness that has been concentrated in northern Asia but is creating worrisome, increasing clusters in the Middle East and Europe. China reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic began in December. The updates bring mainland China's totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths. South Korea now has the second-most cases with 60 reported Tuesday morning, bringing its total to 893. South Korea has reported a near 15-fold increase in infections in a week, as health workers continue to find batches in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas, where panic has brought towns to an eerie standstill. Of the 60 new cases reported by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 49 came from Daegu and the surrounding areas of North Gyeongsang province.   The country also reported its eighth fatality, a man in his 60s who was linked to a hospital in Cheongdo, where a slew of infections has been reported among patients at a mental ward. The government of Canada, which recommends against non-essential travel to China, now also advises travellers to \"exercise a high degree of caution\" in South Korea because of the coronavirus. What researchers have learned about the spread and severity of the coronavirusCanada prepares pandemic response plan as coronavirus cases continue to climb South Korea's government has vowed to fully mobilize public health tools to contain the outbreak to the region surrounding Daegu, but says it isn't considering restricting travel. All Daegu citizens exhibiting cold-like symptoms, estimated at around 30,000 people, will be tested for the virus. The country is also restricting exports to deal with nationwide shortages in face masks. Health authorities expected by Wednesday to finish testing some 1,300 members of the Daegu branch of the Shincheonjin Church of Jesus who have exhibited symptoms, before expanding the tests. The church, which has South Korea's biggest cluster of infections, has agreed to provide authorities a list of all of its 200,000 members nationwide so they could be screened, which could take months. South Korea's cases now outnumber those reported by Japan, where the virus infected almost one-fifth of the passengers and crew on a cruise ship.   Clusters have also emerged in Iran and Italy, and there are concerns that the new outbreaks could signal a serious new stage in the global spread of the illness. Schools were closed in Iran for a second day, and daily sanitizing of public buses and the Tehran metro, which is used by some three million people, was begun.

(China Daily/Reuters) It is not known if any health workers were among the 2,641 new coronavirus cases reported by China's National Health Commission on Friday night.   The new cases bring the total number of people in mainland China infected with the virus, which causes an illness called COVID-19, to 66,492.   The commission also reported 143 more deaths on Friday, mostly in Hubei province, bringing the coronavirus death toll across mainland China to 1,523.   China recently changed the way it is reporting data from the hard-hit Hubei province to include positive cases diagnosed by CT scan.  The World Health Organization (WHO), which provides its own daily tally of cases, is only including cases that have been confirmed with a lab test. WHO investigates spread and severity Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, said at a briefing Friday that the Geneva-based health agency is seeking further clarity from China on how health workers in Hubei are arriving at the clinical diagnosis to ensure other respiratory diseases like the flu aren't being mixed into COVID-19 data. A WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, Ghebreyesus said. The mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 health workers contracted the virus. \"Particular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,\ " Ghebreyesus said.   WATCH: WHO officials talk about diagnosis of health-care workers.

  Canadians trapped in Wuhan, China, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak say they're safe but feeling abandoned by their consular officials. Wayne Tremblay is one of 168 Canadians stuck in Wuhan. He says the streets are quiet, but there are no barricades. Stores are open and nobody is in a panic, but they are anxious, bored and frustrated that American and British governments are working hard to get people out, while Canada is not offering much help. There was nothing out of the ordinary when the Nanaimo, B.C., man headed to Wuhan Jan. 19, but that had all changed just two days later. Cabin fever By Jan. 21, he said, authorities began requiring masks and were reporting the virus was spreading human to human.

Now Tremblay and his spouse are trapped in Wuhan. He said stores are well-stocked and he's seen no panic. \"It's fine other than cabin fever because you are stuck inside a house all day. Every day,\" he said. Wayne Tremblay describes his predicament to CBC's Heather Hiscox: A Canadian man trapped in Wuhan due to the coronavirus outbreak says he may have to travel home alone should a flight be provided for Canadian citizens. His wife would not be able to leave China because the country does not recognize her dual citizenship. 8:33 Tremblay said that he is disappointed with the response he got from Canada's 24-hour consular line. Tremblay said Canadian authorities made it clear that they are not trying to get citizens out on planes. He said that made him feel uneasy. \"Abandoned. Pretty bluntly, just abandoned,\" said Tremblay. His flight home Feb. 2 is now cancelled. \"Everyone is under the assumption that if other countries [are helping citizens get home] that Canada would be doing that — but they are not.\" The streets of Wuhan are quiet but not abandoned.

Han says his parents are struggling to find fresh food — and face masks. \"You either stay home and starve or you risk it and go out to get food,\ " he said. When trucks arrive at the stores, he says, people buy items before they are shelved. But he said the biggest issue is boredom — and the lack of direction from Canada. The instructions are to stay home and stay safe and follow instructions from Chinese officials, he said. \"Physically they are OK. They don't have any symptoms,\" said Han, who is eager to get his family home and some normalcy back. People wearing face masks walk down a deserted street in Wuhan, China, on Tuesday.

  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states. WATCH | How to wash your hands like a surgeon Can washing your hands really slow the spread of COVID-19? That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said.

But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa will avoid destroying valuable medical equipment from the national stockpile from now on by making sure it gets used before it expires.   Trudeau said he was both surprised and dismayed to find out recently that Canada last year destroyed as many as two million N95 respirator masks — the hottest commodity in a COVID-19 ravaged world right now.    The masks, along with more than 400,000 pairs of medical gloves, had expired in 2014. CBC News broke the news last week, prompting a vow from Health Minister Patty Hajdu to review how Ottawa manages its stockpile of emergency equipment. On Monday, Trudeau was asked about the issue by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in the House of Commons. The prime minister said he was troubled by the story. Scheer accused the government of cutting funding for pandemic preparedness from $73 million in 2014, to $51 million in 2019, and allowing precious materials to expire so that they were not available to be used when front-line health workers desperately needed them.   Trudeau said items in the stockpile that are getting older should be distributed for use and then replaced, rather than allowing them to expire.   \"Obviously that didn't happen and we need to make sure we have better protocols going forward so we don't find ourselves in a situation like this,\ " Trudeau said.   CBC InvestigatesHealth minister reviewing management of Canada's emergency stockpileAir passengers will be required to wear non-medical masks starting April 20Some health experts questioning advice against wider use of masks to slow spread of COVID-19 Health Minister Patty Hajdu already admitted recently the stockpile did not have enough supplies in it to meet the needs of this pandemic.    Still, she told the House of Commons Monday the stockpile has been able to fulfil all 33 requests it has had from the provinces for personal protective equipment.    Canada's National Emergency Strategic Stockpile was first created in 1952, but has evolved as  source of emergency supplies to help provinces and territories during a major event or crisis.    It contains everything from medical masks and gloves, to blankets and portable cots, as well as drugs like antivirals, and antidotes for chemical and biological weapons.    Drawing down the stockpile In 2012, there were two national warehouse sites and 11 regional ones in provinces. Dr.  Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said last week there are now six sites.    In the spring of 2019, when the masks and gloves in the Regina warehouse were found to be five years past their expiry date, the government dumped the materials and closed the Warehouse.   The Public Health Agency of Canada says the stockpile has been accessed several times in the last 10 years including during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, as well as during floods, wildfires and a tuberculosis outbreak in Salluit, Que., in 2018.   N95 respirators in particular are in huge demand around the world as one of the only devices able to truly protect someone from being infected with the novel coronavirus because they can filter out airborne particles the best.   Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said last week Canada had ordered about 145 million N95 respirators, and expected about two million of them to be on hospital sites by the end of last week. All of them were coming from China.   Canadian officials working around the clock to secure medical supplies, deputy minister saysMPs pass motion to hold in-person, virtual sittings in House on COVID-19 crisis She said Canada had reserved warehouses in China to collect the equipment, was using Canada's embassy in Beijing to help coordinate and hired both Deloitte Canada and Bollore Canada, to help get the supplies shipped.   But Scheer said Monday there are reports that three chartered planes from Canada sent to China to pick up medical equipment returned to the country empty Sunday. He asked Trudeau if the empty planes were a result of actions by the Chinese government.   Trudeau did not specifically discuss what happened with the planes, but said there are difficulties getting the equipment. \"Yes there have been disruptions in the supply chain because of global competition,\ " he said.   \"We are ensuring we are doing everything we can to get necessary equipment to our front-line workers and so far we've been able to manage it.\"
  A St. John's pharmacist says requests for masks are becoming more and more frequent, as the number of novel coronavirus patients grows worldwide. There haven't been any cases in Newfoundland and Labrador, but Robert Doyle says people have been coming to him with questions about masks. \"We're finding in the last couple of weeks, it's almost every day we're getting either someone comes to the store or calls us on the phone,\ " Doyle told CBC's On The Go.  \"Up to that point, we really didn't have too much request for the mask but it's certainly picking up.\ " St. John's pharmacist Robert Doyle says the demand is making masks harder to come by. (CBC) Doyle, who operates Neighbourhood Pharmacy in St. John's, said the masks are getting harder to get. Along with an increase in demand, there's been a shortage of supply from the wholesalers he deals with. Doyle said N95 masks — which claim to block 95 per cent of air particles — are being put on backorder, and he's had to limit customers from buying more than one box. From Manitoba to China: Donated masks will help front-line workers battle coronavirus Mike Coady works for Sinclair Dental in St. John's, a company that supplies equipment, including masks, to dental practices in the city.   Coady said the company has gone through more masks in the last two days than it usually does in two months. Stock has been decimated and is on backorder, he added. \"It's really ramped up in the last several weeks,\ " Coady said. \"We're just coming back to the customers and saying we have no stock, and no estimated time of arrival when we're going to be able to stock these masks.\ "  Hand sanitizer is becoming also becoming harder to find in St. John's, according to Doyle. (Ryan Cooke/CBC) In 2002 SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — swept the globe, resulting in 774 deaths worldwide. Coady said the current coronavirus epidemic feels much the same.   \"[It's the] same exact thing happening. If you speak to some of the senior people that have been around customer service and in the dental business back then, it's a repeat of that,\ " he said. \"It's certainly an issue. …  There's no end in sight.\ " Globally, there's been a massive swell in demand for the masks. A search of classified sites show people selling boxes of them for between $10 and $30 per mask in Canadian cities. Boxes of N95 masks are selling for as much as $600.

  A Facebook group is creating space for Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists to express themselves while observing physical distancing measures because of COVID-19. The group, called Breathe, was started by two Métis women, Nathalie Bertin and Lisa Shepherd. It calls on bead workers and traditional artists to put their spin on the concept of a face mask. \"This project is born out of our cultural arts and our desire to create community during this crazy time,\" said Bertin.   Bertin is a multi-disciplinary artist from Toronto with roots in the Michilimackinac area of Michigan and the Nipissing region of Ontario.   She said when the two first conceptualized the idea for the online group, they thought about making it for Métis artists but then wanted to include First Nations and Inuit artists as well.   \"The virus doesn't know any borders, doesn't know race, doesn't know ethnicity,\ " said Shepherd, who is currently living in Vancouver.   They decided to open the group up to all artists but made sure that the description specifies work with traditional materials.   Artists from across the country and beyond have been joining the group and sharing their creations.   “ This project is kind of borne out of our cultural arts and our desire to create community and during this crazy time,” says Bertin.   (Submitted by Nathalie Bertin) Shepherd said that at the beginning of the pandemic she felt bogged down by emotions and found it difficult to pick up a needle and thread to start creating.   \"I still had this desire to want to be able to do something as an artist, to be able to offer healing, to offer opportunity for other people to work through their own thoughts,\ " she said. Traditional crafters Indigenizing face masks during COVID-19 pandemic In having discussions with fellow artists like Bertin, Shepherd said she realized  she wasn't alone in feeling this way. \"I could see the benefit for other artists getting involved in the project, in whatever way the project could help them, to untangle the threads and help them to move through all of this.\" Creating community The group was opened on Facebook on April 6 and has over 1,200 members. Members of the group are encouraged to share their creations through photos and stories about their process in designing and creating their masks.   UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear them \"The mask itself is the initial inspiration,\" said Shepherd. \"We learned early on that the mask is not protecting [the wearer] from COVID-19.  When I wear the mask, I'm protecting you and I'm taking care of the community.\ " She said the idea of the group is to help everyone take care of each other.   \"I think that there's an incredible beauty and incredible love that's being created and I think that it deserves to be seen,\ " said Bertin.   They hope to someday see a gallery exhibit of masks created.  
  Ottawa residents trapped in Wuhan, China described their relief and exhaustion Thursday, hours before they began their journey home from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. One Ottawa man travelling with his two parents is aboard the Canadian evacuation flight destined for CFB Trenton, which departed Thursday afternoon eastern time. Three other locals took off from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport later in the day: 50-year-old Kai Huang, his 78-year-old mother, Yi Huang, and another male passenger.    If there were viruses around, I'm pretty sure it's on people's clothes, on people's items, passports.​​​​​​- Passenger All three were cleared this week to board a U.S. charter flight travelling to Vancouver, which left the airport Thursday evening. Passengers on the U.S. flight will disembark in Vancouver before travelling onward to Trenton, where returnees will be quarantined at a military base for 14 days. Permanent residency an issue for mother and son RCMP program analyst Kai Huang initially feared he would have to leave his mother behind in Wuhan because of her status as a permanent resident. But a day before the flight, Huang and his mother Yi were given the green light to board a U.S. charter evacuation plane. \"My mother feels very excited,\ " Huang said from inside the airport. \"She...can leave Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak.\" Huang and his mother were initially due to depart Wuhan two days after the city was placed on lockdown Jan. 23, which blocked travel in and out of the region.   A screenshot of footage inside Wuhan Tianhe International Airport Thursday, before travellers boarded their flights.   (Submitted by Kai Huang) But while Huang is a Canadian citizen, his mother — who moved to Ottawa in 2006 — only holds permanent residency.   Huang said he was told by the Canadian government that Yi wouldn't be able to get a spot on an evacuation flight.   China previously determined that only permanent residents accompanying Canadian children would be permitted to fly out, but Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Thursday that Canada was pushing to widen that allowance.   Why it's taking so long to get Canadians out of Wuhan, and other coronavirus airlift questions Some permanent residents of Canada will be allowed to leave Wuhan if they accompany a Canadian child   The thought of abandoning his mother deeply concerned Huang, who said Yi suffered a stroke last year. The Barrhaven resident was worried his mother might need medical attention that would be hard to come by in the shuttered city. \"Her home is in Ottawa. She doesn't have a husband and also she only has one child to take care of her,\ " said Huang, his mother's sole caretaker.   Kai Huang sent CBC News a copy of a letter he received from the Embassy of Canada in Beijing, which he needed to pass through checkpoints to enter Wuhan's airport. (Submitted by Kai Huang) The uncertainty ended when Huang finally received confirmation that the pair would be able to travel together on an American flight.   \"My mom is very happy about this and appreciates all the people who [supported] her,\ " Huang said.   ' I'm pretty exhausted,' passenger says Another Ottawa man, who CBC agreed not to name due to concerns for his family's safety, described how worn out he felt before he boarded the Canadian charter flight with his parents. \"I'm pretty exhausted. I'm spent. I'm not even thinking right now,\ " the man said from behind a white face mask. He described the check-in process as \"a little bit disturbing\" because passengers needed to take off their masks multiple times. \"If there were viruses around , I'm pretty sure it's on people's clothes, on people's items, passports,\ " he said. \"Eventually those things will infect people if they do indeed exist among the population here.\" Flight miscommunication frustrating An Ottawa woman, who also preferred not to be named, said her husband eventually got a seat aboard the U.S. flight bound for Vancouver. She said flight delays and miscommunication from Global Affairs Canada about which flight he would be on caused immense frustration for her family. \"We've been very anxious for the last two weeks,\ " she said. \"I think everyone is quite exhausted both physically and mentally.\" Yukon Lodge at Canadian Forces Base Trenton is the quarantine location for Canadians evacuated from China due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Kai Huang said he plans to read books and exercise during his time on the base. (Alex Filipe/Reuters) The woman explained that while she wants to see her husband again, she supports Canada's quarantine efforts in Trenton. \"I'm grateful that the government is doing that,\" she said. \"It's safe for the public and safe for the families.\ " She said that if she's allowed, she hopes to pick her husband up at the Canadian Forces base after his period of quarantine is over. 
  On the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, the days are long and stressful.  Despite working with a close-knit and supportive team, one day Felicia Letourneau, a nurse at Lakeshore General Hospital, started her shift feeling discouraged. Then, she noticed a bag full of gifts for everyone in her unit — headbands, with tags that read \"Headbands for Heroes\" — and that lifted her spirits. \"I've been a surgical practical nurse for 12 years and I've never felt so appreciated,\ " Letourneau said. For many frontline health-care workers, wearing masks for their entire shift, every shift, is a strain on their skin, especially on their ears. But Letourneau and hundreds of her colleagues in Montreal are a little more comfortable these days, thanks to these handmade headbands. The headbands have buttons sewn on, which hold the mask's elastic ear loops in place, avoiding any contact with or strain on ears. The words on the tag are especially touching, Letourneau said. \"It reminds us what we're doing and that we are heroes … working hard.\ " The people behind the headbands Volunteers, part of a Montreal Facebook group called Operation MTL Covid 19 - Virtual Helping Hands, are behind the headband-making initiative. Sabrina Maryse Stoute, a senior nurse working for a pharmaceutical company, started the Facebook group. She remembers her days as an emergency room nurse and the pain she experienced wearing masks for extended periods of time. She wanted to find a way to help friends and former colleagues who are still on the frontlines, so she did some research online and learned that patterns exist for \"Headbands for Heroes\" and initiatives exist in other provinces and countries. Each delivery includes a variety of colours and sizes and enough headbands for every worker in the department - from housekeeping staff to physicians, said organizer Sabrina Maryse Stoute. (Submitted by Sabrina Maryse Stoute)   The only problem? Stoute can't sew. So she recruited two friends, Kristy Westlake, an elementary school teacher, and Tanya D'Amato, a customer service administrator, and they put the call out on social media, looking for more volunteers. \"They just came running,\ " Stoute said. The Facebook group now has more than 1,400 members. Stoute is co-ordinating 30 women of all ages who are sewing headbands for Montreal health-care workers every day. \"They've been producing bands in record time … 654 headbands in 12 days, which is incredible,\ " she said. For some of the volunteers, sewing is a distraction from loneliness and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I say 'busy hands, calm minds,'\" Stoute said. Sabrina Maryse Stoute started the Facebook group Operation MTL Covid 19 - Virtual Helping Hands and runs it with friends Kristy Westlake and Tanya D’Amato. (Submitted by Sabrina Maryse Stoute)   All the volunteers involved in sewing must be self-isolating, with the exception of buying groceries once a week, and they must have no symptoms, Stoute said. Stoute is limiting her travel, so all the sewing volunteers must live relatively close to her home, on Montreal's West Island. She has no physical contact with volunteers — they wave to her from their windows when she collects the headbands from their porches. Stoute takes charge of dropping off materials, picking up headbands, and making deliveries to hospitals. When Stoute arrives at a hospital with a delivery, even though everyone is wearing masks, \"you can still see in their eyes, the smile, the happiness and the gratitude.\" Headbands in high demand Orders for the headbands keep pouring in from various departments at several Montreal hospitals and from long-term care facilities. The group is currently preparing headbands for two CHSLDs, the emergency department at the Jewish General Hospital, the psychiatry department at St. Mary's Hospital, and the COVID-19 unit at the Lakeshore General Hospital. The Facebook group has also received more than $1,700 in donations, money that goes toward purchasing elastics, buttons and other materials, and has bought meals for more than 140 health-care workers so far. \"They're taking care of our community, so our community needs to take care of them,\" Stoute said. Constantly wearing masks is a strain on healthcare workers' skin, especially their ears. A Montreal community is helping ease that pain by sewing hundreds of \"Headbands for Heroes\" and delivering them to hospitals. Daybreak's Shari Okeke brings us that story. 12:02 Once the crisis is over, Stoute says she's looking forward to meeting the women working so hard sewing the headbands every day. \"I haven't met any of them in person and I just want to give them a hug,\ " she said. \"They are heroes as much as anyone.\"
  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.   WATCH |  Dr. Samir Gupta explains what you should consider before putting on a mask against COVID-19: Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Which mask is recommended for health-care workers? For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask? Your COVID-19 questions answeredMask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more action There also is limited evidence that healthy people wearing masks reduces the community spread of diseases, like COVID-19, as public health officials have been saying, but some acknowledge that's partly because studies haven't been done. A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

Medical experts say there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are avoiding contact with other people as they're supposed to be. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03

  Science magazine had been trying for days to speak to the elusive George Gao, head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. When the magazine asked him if he could point to any mistakes that might explain why Western countries were struggling to flatten the coronavirus curve, he didn't miss a beat. \"The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren't wearing masks,\" he said. \"You've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.\" That advice is contradicted by the World Health Organization, the government of Canada and federal public health officials like Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam. On its webpage, the WHO says that \"if you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected [COVID-19] infection.\ " \"Putting a mask on an asymptomatic person is not beneficial, obviously, if you're not infected,\ " Tam said Monday.   Watch: Dr. Tam on why Canadians don't need to wear masks Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam spoke to reporters on Monday 2:15 Only medical masks such as those labelled N95 are designed and fitted to filter out particles that carry the COVID-19 virus. Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce concentrations of some aerosol particles. A 2015 randomized clinical trial found that cloth masks, for example, did not block influenza and respiratory viruses and actually increased the rate of infections among health care workers compared to those who wore surgical masks, and even surgical masks blocked only slightly more than half of virus particles. Asymptomatic spreaders Dr. K.K. Cheng, director of the Institute of Applied Health Research at the University of Birmingham in the U.K., said that Tam's advice makes a dangerous assumption — that an asymptomatic person is not a spreader. \"The important thing about this coronavirus is that some patients start to shed virus, and become infectious, even before they have symptoms,\" he said. \"In public health , a principle is we try to limit the source of harmful exposures rather than do mitigation, if we can. Hand-washing is a form of mitigation. \"I'm not suggesting in the least that people should stop washing hands.  It's very important. But if you're out in public in a supermarket, or in a subway train or on the bus, I think it makes a lot of sense for everyone to wear a mask.\ " While officials in the West caution that the explanations for Asian countries' greater success in controlling the pandemic are complex, officials from the countries themselves — such as Gao and Cheng as well as some South Korean specialists — often point to masks. Now some European governments are choosing to follow pro-mask policies. A man wearing a protective mask measures the body temperatures of Austrian soldiers entering the foreign ministry in Vienna. Austria has started requiring masks in some public places, such as supermarkets. (Ronald Zak/The Associated Press) Austria on Monday banned members of the public from entering a supermarket without one. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that is only the first step toward wider adoption of masks. Next door, the Czech Republic requires everyone to wear a mask in public. The country has experienced a lower-than-average spread of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. is also reportedly considering whether it should revise its guidance on masks, according to the Washington Post. It, too, recommends that only those with symptoms and those caring for them wear masks. Masks or elbows Of course, the fact that many countries where mask use is widespread have been more successful at flattening the curve does not necessarily mean that the masks themselves account for the difference. Most experts would point to a mix of factors, including more aggressive testing and tracing of infections and tight controls on movement of the population. But Cheng said much of the opposition to masks arises because officials in Europe and North America \"have never really grasped the point that wearing masks is not primarily to protect the wearer. The original motivation is to protect others.\" \"In a severe pandemic, the main objective of any public health intervention is to limit the source of infection, things that are coming out of our respiratory tract,\ " he told CBC News. For Cheng, the concern expressed by some public health officials — that people will end up wearing masks that aren't up to the highest standards — is a red herring. He said any mouth and nose covering is superior to telling people to cough into their elbows, as the government of Canada does now. \"I just don't understand that. Really, it's a simple mechanical thing,\ " Cheng said. \"If people wear masks as a self-protective measure and want to protect themselves from others, then I think you really need a hi-spec mask, and no one has got an oversupply of those. \"But we don't really need that if everyone practices this.\" The most sophisticated masks must be saved for the health care workers who face the greatest exposure. Dr. Elaine Shuo Feng is part of an Oxford University team that studied different countries' approaches to masks. She agrees that health workers must get priority. \"But I don't think this is a good reason … to tell the public that a face mask is not effective and to work on the supply issue,\ " she told CBC News. \"I think there are a lot of things that you need to do.\ " False sense of confidence Canadian officials have cited the risk that people won't use masks properly and could expose themselves to greater danger as a result as one of the reasons not to recommend mask wearing for the general public. \"What we worry about is actually the potential negative aspects of wearing masks where people are not protecting their eyes, or you know, other aspects of where a virus could enter your body,\" said Tam. \"And that gives you a false sense of confidence, but also, it increases the touching of your face. If you think about it, if you've got a mask around your face, sometimes you can't help it, because you're just touching parts of your face.\ " Cheng said masks, in fact, inhibit contact between the hand and the mouth, and people can be taught to wash their hands after touching them. \"Very few people before this pandemic knew how to wash their hands properly,\" he said. \"But you don't go about telling people there's no point in washing your hands. You show them a video showing them how to wash their hands.   \"It's not a logical argument, really. It's not beyond the realm of most people's IQ to learn how to wear a mask properly.\" The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks  makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission. Not everyone can self-isolate Cheng agrees that people with symptoms should not be going out at all. But he said it's wrong to base advice on the assumption that everyone can self-isolate. \"During this phase when we're locked down, unfortunately, there are still heroes of our society who've got to go to work to keep the country going. Health care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers,\ " he said. A woman wearing a face mask selects whole fish at a supermarket in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Some infectious disease experts in Asia say masks were a key part of slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus disease. (Vincent Thian/The Associated Press) Cheng said he doesn't agree with arguments about creating a false sense of security. \"People have raised the hypothesis that if you ask people to wear a mask, they'll feel invincible, and then they won't bother with handwashing, for example,\" he said. \"There's absolutely no evidence that this is the case. I would argue it's the opposite — that this would heighten one's sense of caution and hygiene, and it would stop people from touching the mouth.\ " Shuo Feng stressed that she does not recommend using self-made masks, which do not block the virus.   \"I think people better stay at home if they could, stay as much as possible and do the best of social distancing,\" she said. \"However, there could be situations that people cannot avoid the crowded areas, and in that case, if they cannot get a surgical mask, then having a self-made mask might be better than not wearing a face mask … it might not be as effective as a surgical mask, but at least it provides some protection.\" Open to change? In her remarks Monday, Tam did seem to suggest that the government was open to reconsidering its advice. \"We are continuing to evaluate. Of course, we can be flexible if we find any new evidence.\" The Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. denied this weekend that it was about to reverse its advice on masks. But cracks are appearing in the North American public health establishment. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the Centers for Disease Control \"should be putting out guidelines ...  on how you can develop a mask on your own.\ " The WHO has advised against the use of cotton or gauze masks in any circumstance. Even for medical masks, the WHO provides strict advice on the correct disposal of used masks and recommends against the re-use of single-use masks. UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear themTop public health officer says coming week a crucial period in COVID-19 struggleCBC InvestigatesWhy Germany's low COVID-19 death rate might be a mirage But Cheng said the wider use of masks can be part of the eventual unlocking of society. \"Maybe two months from now, if we're lucky, we may emerge from this, and we have to think about how we reopen the economy,\" he said.   \"We have to reduce social distancing. \"I think everyone wearing a mask for a period of time to be determined would actually help us to get back to normality. People would still have to practise social distancing but without all the schools being closed and so on.\ " Shuo Feng said there's no single approach that will beat the virus, but \"now is the right time to talk about face masks and to reconsider the recommendation of face masks to the general population.\ " Watch: The National: Clearing up the confusion around whether masks protect against COVID-19 While public health officials tell Canadians not to wear masks unless they’re sick, other countries take a different approach, leading to confusion for some. 2:05 
  The test that said a worker at a Gimli nursing home had COVID-19 was a false positive, Manitoba's top doctor says. Chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin made the announcement at a news conference Sunday afternoon. Last week, nine residents at Betel Home started showing symptoms of respiratory illness and were tested for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus after being in contact with the employee who was thought to have it. Roussin said on Saturday that no residents at the home tested positive for COVID-19. 9 residents sick with respiratory symptoms at Gimli care home after worker tests positive for COVID-19'All we can do is hope' : Families fret after COVID-19 hits Gimli care home Sherry-Lee Benson Podolchuk's 95-year-old father lives at the home.

Of these patients, 11 people are in hospital, with seven of those in intensive care.

And more COVID-19 questions from Nova Scotians, answered  Q: Who should be self-isolating, and how should they do it? On March 18, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, explained \"physical distancing\" and \"self-isolation\" as a series of layers.   The first layer is physical distancing, also known as social distancing. This is something everyone needs to be doing:   Keep two metres (six feet) between yourself and other people. Keep your grocery shopping or other errands to essential times only. Work from home if possible.   People who are social distancing can use their phones, video calling and social networking to support others who are having a difficult time. The people in the first layer must also help those who are in the next layer, which is self-isolation.   That layer contains people who have travelled recently and must now self-isolate. They may not feel sick or have any symptoms but for everyone's safety, they must not interact with people outside their immediate household.   They should not go grocery shopping. They should not take transit or taxis. People in self-isolation may go outside on their deck, balcony or yard, but should otherwise remain indoors.   People who live in apartment buildings or condominiums should stay in their own unit, although being on a balcony is permitted. A deeper layer of self-isolation is close contacts of a known case. These are people who have a COVID-19 patient in their homes or have interacted closely with a known COVID-19 patient. They may not feel sick yet, but they are at high risk of becoming sick. These people need to be even more vigilant about being separated from other people. The last layer is people who are sick. They have either gone to be tested and are waiting for the test result, or they've got the test result back and they're positive. Those people need strict home isolation. They should not be outside their homes. They should not even be interacting with other people in their household. If possible they should not share their bedroom or bathroom.   A person who has had COVID-19 and recovers will slowly move back into the preceding layers. Once that person is completely well, they will be able to go about their life while observing the same physical distancing as everyone else. Q: Can someone who is self-isolating go outside? Yes, as long as that person stays in their yard, deck or balcony. On March 18, public health officials still felt that it was safe for someone who is self-isolating to go outside for exercise if they did so alone or with members of their immediate household, but as of March 25 and going forward, that advice has become stricter. Q: My employer is forcing me to go to work and I don't feel safe. What can I do?   Unless your workplace is a type of business that has a specific exemption, your employer is required to provide a workplace that allows you to keep a distance of two metres (or six feet) from others. If that is not possible your employer must limit the number of people entering to five or fewer. In addition, every person who has travelled outside the province and returns after 6 a.m. on March 23 is required to self-isolate.   If your workplace is breaking any of these rules, it is in violation of an order by the province's medical officer of health, Dr. Strang. The health protection order signed by Dr. Strang trumps any workplace directives. The provincial Department of Labour is advising employees to bring their concerns to their immediate supervisor. If that doesn't work, the next step is to report them to your workplace's Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee, if one exists. If not, people can call the province's safety branch at 1-800-9LABOUR. If you are in a unionized workplace, you may consider raising your concern with your union. \"If you have no other route, then [contact] your local Public Health Office,\" said Dr. Strang. \"We will help you out.\ " Q: I think my neighbour is going out when they shouldn't be. What can I do?   First, stay calm. Public health leaders have stressed it is important for us to act kindly and compassionately and to recognize that we do not know our neighbour's unique circumstances. If the person appears to be acting in an unsafe manner, the premier has suggested that you should reach out to them and offer assistance. They may be leaving their home because they feel they have no choice. In a way that feels safe to you, ask that person if you can help them with self-isolation -- for example, bring them groceries or run an important errand.   Dr. Strang has told us is it is inappropriate to \"rat\" on our neighbours.   \"We don't want to approach the situation with fear,\" he said. \"We need to approach the situation from a sense of caring for each other and a sense of community.\ "  Q: Why aren't we testing more people for COVID-19? The microbiology lab at the QEII Health Centre in Halifax conducts all the tests for COVID-19 in the province. The province has attempted to balance the criteria for testing against the lab's ability to process the samples.   As of Monday, March 23, the QEII was able to \"confirm\" results. That means tests no longer have to be sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation, which means people can get their results faster.   As of Tuesday, March 24, the QEII lab was able to process 400 tests per day, and Dr. Strang said the next goal is to increase the lab's capacity to 1200 or even more. Prior to March 24, the lab could process 200 tests per day.   Dr. Strang has emphasized that it is not practical or possible to test everyone. The \"validity\" of a test is at its highest when someone is showing symptoms such as fever and cough. People who don't show symptoms but are tested are at a higher risk of getting an inaccurate result, such as a false negative.    Q: What is Nova Scotia doing to determine whether there is community spread? Is the province looking at broadening the testing criteria? As of Tuesday, March 24, Dr. Strang said so far there has been no indication of spread in the community, and health officials are actively looking for it.   Up until now, when someone is diagnosed with COVID-19, health officials have waited until that person's \"close contacts\" became unwell before testing them. That's changing. The province will now test close contacts of COVID-19 patients right away, and the hope is that will indicate whether the disease has been spread to people who aren't yet showing symptoms.   There are two elements in how a \"close contact\" is defined. One is physical distance, and one is time. In general, the closer you get to a person and the longer you stay near them, the greater the risk of transmission. For example, if you have a family member in your home and you lived with them or cared for them while they were coughing or sneezing, you would definitely be considered a close contact. According to the province's guidelines to health professionals, \"transient interactions\" like walking by a person or being briefly in the same room carries a low risk of transmission.   The province is doing some other things to look for community spread as well. It is starting to test individuals in hospitals who have strong COVID-like symptoms such as cough and fever, even if those people haven't necessarily travelled anywhere.   Public health is tracking people who go to hospital emergency rooms with \"flu-like\" symptoms such as fever and cough. As or March 23, the province has not seen an increase in those numbers but they're watching for a spike, which would be a possible indicator of COVID-19.   They're also looking for outbreaks of respiratory diseases in long-term care homes. So far the province has not found any unusual outbreaks.   Q: What trails can I use for exercise now that all provincial, municipal, and national parks are closed?   Any provincial trails not within a provincial park or beach remain open for people to get exercise. In HRM, residential pathways that connect streets, multi-use paths along streets that replace sidewalks, and some trails may be used. People can only use trails in their neighbourhood that aren't connected to a park, or in a park.    Other municipalities have closed some or all of their trails, and a more complete list is here.   In general, the premier has asked Nova Scotians to stay close to home and walk for exercise, not to socialize. He suggested that if a person must drive to a location to walk, they're going too far.   Q: A business in my neighbourhood is still operating. I thought it was supposed to shut down. Why is it still open? As of March 23, non-essential businesses are permitted to be open but they must keep a distance of six feet between everyone inside the business. If a business is too small to maintain six feet of space between the people inside it, it must allow no more than five customers inside at a time.   Q: Does my business or workplace qualify for an exception to the five-person rule?   There are some exceptions to the five-person rule. The public health order gives exceptions to businesses and organizations who can maintain physical distancing such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, convenience stores, construction sites, financial institutions and agri-food and fish plants. All Canadian Blood Services blood collection clinics have been re-arranged to ensure safe physical distancing and are also exempt.   The health protection order signed by Dr. Strang on March 24 also recognizes that some workplaces are exempt from the five-person rule and cannot maintain physical distance.   Those workers who are exempt from both rules include:  Special care homes for children and youth. Organizations that care for people with disabilities. Long-term care homes. Home care agencies. Court and correctional workers. Unlicensed daycares (six children or fewer, or eight school-aged children). Homeless shelters. Doctors, nurses, paramedics. People who service or repair medical equipment like wheelchairs. Food production plants. Fishing vessels. Taxis. Police and fire. Municipal utilities. Public transit, and a number of other types of municipal support workers.   For the complete list see the province's health protection order.   Q: Who is an essential worker?   The province's health protection order issued on March 23 lists certain workers who are considered \"essential to the movement of people and goods.\ " Those people won't be asked to self-isolate for 14 days if they enter the province. Provided they are not sick, they can go straight to work.   Those people include: truck drivers, crew and maintenance workers on airplanes, trains, or transport ships, offshore workers, people who work in the agri-food and fishing industries, health care workers, medical supply business workers, child protection workers, transition house workers, critical infrastructure workers, law enforcement and corrections workers, military, Coast Guard, RCMP, police, firefighters, and paramedics.   It is important for everyone else who enters the province for other reasons to self-isolate immediately so these people can continue to go to work without getting sick.   Essential workers must still practice physical distancing as much as they can, and must self-isolate if they become sick.   Q:  Does the order on maintaining six feet of separation include the people I live with? What about my partner or children? If everyone in your household is healthy, you do not have to maintain a six-foot distance from each other. But if one of you is sick and you suspect it may be COVID-19, you should take certain precautions.   Health Canada recommends the sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom from everyone else. The sick person should keep at least six feet apart from everyone else, and should wear a mask when interacting with others. The sick person should avoid touching pets so the pets don't carry the virus from person to person.   The sick person should wash their hands often, clean and disinfect any surfaces or objects they touch often, and don't share objects such as towels, dishes, bed linens, or electronic devices.   MORE TOP STORIESAfter blood donations plummet during pandemic, donors answer the call — big timeSeed company sprouts new business during COVID-19 outbreakWhat you need to know about getting new prescriptions, refillsVideo ceremonies and no honeymoons: How COVID-19 is impacting N.S. weddingsDalhousie research team prepares for clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine
  Nunavut's top doctor says it's only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, reaches the territory.   Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut's chief medical officer of health, said in a news conference Monday that the actions of Nunavummiut over the next few weeks will determine how badly the territory could be hit by COVID-19. Practicing social distancing, regular hand washing, and self-isolating when people feel sick can help contain the virus.   \"The fact is that COVID-19 has the potential to have a much greater impact on Nunavut than other jurisdictions,\ " Patterson said. Premier Joe Savikataaq noted that overcrowded housing is an obstacle to keeping the community healthy.   \"Even in a crowded house, the hygiene of washing your hands and not touching and not sharing stuff will make a big difference on the spread of the virus, even within the house,\" he said.   As of Tuesday, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut. The territorial government says it will inform the public if there are any confirmed cases. What is social distancing? For Nunavummiut, it means some tough choices-not kuniking, not hugging Elders, not shaking hands, not pre-chewing food for babies and toddlers, staying away from community events and staying home if you don’t feel well. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> < a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlattenTheCurve?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#FlattenTheCurve</a > <a href=\"https://t.co/55z1AdgzHd\">pic.twitter.com/55z1AdgzHd</a>&mdash;@JSavikataaq Savikataaq said about 50 tests for COVID-19 have been completed in Nunavut. About half have come back negative and the rest are still waiting for results.   A spokesperson from the Nunavut Department of Health said turnaround times vary for COVID-19 tests across the territory.   In Iqaluit, tests can come back within two to three days, while in other Nunavut communities it can take up to a week. The weather can cause flight delays, impacting when the results come back, but the territorial government says that hasn't happened yet.    The government says once commercial testing becomes available, they will be able to get results much quicker.   How health centres are preparing for COVID-19 Savikataaq said all Nunavut health centres have been stocked with proper safety equipment for health care workers to deal with COVID-19. That includes two weeks' worth of safety masks, goggles, disposable gowns and gloves.   Rankin Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Iqaluit have extra supplies if communities need more.    However, Savikataaq said self-isolation is the first line of defence in making sure health care centres don't become overburdened.   What to do if you think you have COVID-19 : A guide to each province and territoryBaffinland sending all Nunavummiut home over COVID-19 concerns Savikataaq said about 80 per cent of people who contract COVID-19 will not need medical attention. They will be asked to self-isolate and practice social distancing to stop the spread.   People who do need medical attention will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, he said.    What to do if you think you may have COVID-19   Symptoms for COVID-19 are a cough, difficulty breathing and fever. People with symptoms are asked to call their local health centre rather than attend in person. \"We want to do all we can to keep [the communities] from having an outbreak and if we do our part as Nunavummiut then we can sure lessen that,'' Savikataaq said.    Savikataaq, Patterson and Health Minister George Hickes, plan to hold a press conference every day at 3 p.m. to update the public on COVID-19. 
  France will adopt an aggressive new regimen for COVID-19 testing on May 11 so that it can slowly unwind its coronavirus lockdown and avoid an economic meltdown, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said on Tuesday. The government set itself a goal of carrying out at least 700,000 tests per week, he said. Once a person tests positive, tracing would begin to identify, test and isolate all those who had been in close contact with the individual, with the state covering the full cost of testing. \"When we end the lockdown, we will have the capacity to massively scale up testing,\ " Philippe said in an address to parliament. France has been carrying out around 200,000 tests a week, far fewer than its neighbour Germany.   Philippe said the lockdown had saved tens of thousands of lives, but the time had come to ease the unprecedented peacetime restrictions and rescue an economy in free-fall.

(Thibault Camus/The Associated Press) However, he warned that the infection rate would spiral if France moved too swiftly and people became complacent. \"We are on a knife's edge. I am having to choose between bad decisions,\ " he said, shortly before parliament voted in favour of his plans. France's Health Ministry said the country's death toll rose to 23,660 on Tuesday, the world's fourth highest behind the United States, Italy and Spain. Still, the number of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in France has fallen daily for two weeks, while the amount of patients in intensive care has declined for 19 consecutive days. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 28AnalysisHow France found itself in the middle of a coronavirus catastrophe France's new testing regimen will be implemented as the country starts relaxing lockdown restrictions on May 11. Still, the planned timeline hinges on the number of new coronavirus infections remaining below 3,000 per day, the prime minister said. \"If the indicators are not right, we will not unwind the lockdown on May 11, or we will do it more strictly,\ " he said. The number of confirmed new cases dropped below 3,000 on April 15. In the past seven days, the average number of new cases per day has been around 1,500. Work-at-home still encouraged where possible The prime minister said if May 11 is workable, non-essential French retailers could reopen their doors on that date, but they they would have the right to insist that shoppers wear masks on the premises. Philippe said services on the Paris metro would be increased to allow people to commute to work while observing physical distancing, and that restrictions would stay in place for long-distance train travel. Where possible, people should continue working from home beyond May 11, he said.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe delivers his speech to present the government's plan to unwind the country's coronavirus lockdown at the National Assembly on Tuesday.      (David Niviere/Reuters) Kindergartens and elementary schools will reopen nationwide on May 11 but on a voluntary basis. From May 18, the government will consider opening middle schools in districts where there are only weak outbreaks of the virus and will decide at the end of May if upper schools can be opened in early June. Kindergarteners will not be allowed to wear masks to avoid misuse, and the government will make masks available for middle school students who are not able to get them themselves. Class sizes will be kept to 15 students per class and distance learning will remain free for those students who stay home. However, some opposition lawmakers and experts questioned the practicality of schools reopening and the broad use of public transport.

There were about 10 matches left in France's top soccer table, while its main rugby league was in playoff semifinals.

  The COVID-19 pandemic means hundreds of community litter cleanups —  a rite of spring for many volunteers — won't happen this year in St. John's. The task of cleaning up the garbage uncovered by retreating snowbanks will fall largely to city workers. \"We'll do our best to get through,\" said Ian Froude, Ward 4 councillor and chair of the city's public works and sustainability committee. \"We'll have a group of about 80 staff, including the downtown litter crew and our parks staff and our waste division, to do cleanups.\" Coun. Ian Froude says people can help by ensuring their own properties are clean and picking up after their dogs. (Gary Locke/CBC)   Froude said the COVID-19 outbreak has changed, and slowed down, the cleanup work done by city staff. \"They have to follow rules like other workplaces. So, for instance, they can only have one individual in a vehicle at a time and they have to wear proper personal protective equipment, and of course large cleanup groups aren't possible now,\ " he said. Public health restrictions mean removing the trash scattered around the city will take much longer than usual. \"Then you add the layer on of community groups not being able to get out. So, Clean St. John's is not able to organize their cleanups, and with 300 of those being scheduled each year, [that's] a significant amount of litter that's not being picked up by the community this year,\" said Froude. City workers have been given safety instructions and equipment for picking up items such as discarded safety gloves and masks. Froude said the best way for people to help is to make sure to clean up their own properties as well as picking up after their dogs when out for a walk. If residents see a littered park or open space, they should report it to the city through the service centre. Froude said hundreds of city garbage bins that were removed for the winter will soon be returned to city parks and open spaces. However, the pandemic has cancelled another option for most people in St. John's. The Robin Hood Bay landfill is closed to residential users to promote physical distancing. Froude says residents who do pick up litter will have to put it in their own garbage bins. St. John's began using automated garbage trucks, like this one in Mount Pearl, in 2018. (CBC) Froude said the city hopes there will be less trash around this year than in previous years. One of the reasons for moving to automated garbage trucks was to reduce the amount of litter around St. John's, he said. Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador
    As Canada's first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Ontario, at least three major medical supply stores in Winnipeg say they are sold out of the N95 face mask.   19 in Ontario being investigated for coronavirus after 1 case confirmed, 1 presumed   At the Stevens Home Medical Supplies Store in the Health Sciences Centre, general manager Rick Stephens said last week, 20 boxes each containing 50 masks flew off the shelf in a single day. \"We can't keep any on the shelf. We are completely out of inventory. Out of 10 calls coming in, nine are going to be in respect to face mask inventory,\" said Stephens.   The N95 offers the best protection and has the highest filtration, he says. All of his boxes of surgical procedure masks that don't offer as high a level of protection as the N95 are also gone. See a demo: At the Stevens Home Medical Supplies Store in the Health Sciences Centre, general manger Rick Stephens said last week, 20 boxes each containing 50 masks flew off the shelf in a single day. 0:55   Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus   Stephens says most of his customers are looking to purchase masks to send to family in China, because of shortages there. \"One gentleman was very distraught over the whole issue of not being able to get masks. He was very tearful about the issue,\" said Stephens. \"We have a huge empathy toward their needs but our hands are bound to what we can get for them.\ " Stephens says a couple of customers wanted to buy his entire inventory, but company policy prevents him from selling large volumes to one individual. He says retailers learned from the H1N1 crisis in 2009 where companies bought up all the masks and then resold them for huge profit. Stephens compares what he sees happening now to the H1N1 crisis.   Health officials confirm 6 cases of swine flu in Canada  \"We are starting to see the same ramping up we saw exactly during H1N1. We had people coming in looking for product themselves for their own protection. And then all of a sudden we had others coming in wanting to buy everything in sight. And that is exactly in Canada the direction we are going again. And yet nothing actually has been declared in terms of a pandemic here in Canada,\" said Stephens. Stevens Home Medical has 100 cases of each mask on back order.   Customer April Scott noticed the sold out sign on the door of the business. She was glad to have gotten a mask from the respiratory clinic where she had an appointment. \"Having a respiratory illness, I have to be more cautious,\ " she said. Over at Innovative Medical Supplies on Henderson Highway the story is similar; manager Albert Amante says both mask types are also sold out.   \"Someone wanted to order 2000 masks. One hundred boxes of isolated face masks or surgical procedure masks and 40 boxes of N95. I told her they were on back order,\" said Amante. He said some of his orders are destined for China, others to the Philippines because of the recent volcanic eruption.   Amante says while he isn't hearing panic, he is hearing urgency.   \"They want to get their hands on a physical barrier. People need to realize the N95 does offer protection, but it's ... not 100 percent foolproof that it will prevent this flu,\ " said Amante.   Will face masks protect you from the flu?   The province agrees.   In a written statement a provincial spokesperson says the risk of coronavirus in Manitoba is considered low. The statement goes on to say, \"It is not clear there is any significant benefit to wearing masks to prevent influenza or influenza-like illnesses including the coronavirus in the community setting.\ " Good hand hygiene is known to provide significant protection from viral respiratory illnesses, the province said. People are encouraged to regularly wash their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner after coughing, sneezing, caring for a sick person, while preparing food ,and after using the toilet. Other measures include avoiding close contact with anyone showing signs of a respiratory illness such as coughing or sneezing.   At least three major medical supply stores in Winnipeg say they are sold out of the protective N95 face mask. Most of them have been bought to send to family members overseas. 2:06     
  Guillaume Tardif, a soon-to-be-retired army tank officer, quietly but frantically combed the internet in January as coronavirus reports coming out of Wuhan, China became more alarming. Even then, he was convinced a viral storm was approaching and was determined to do everything possible to protect his wife, a Montreal emergency room physician — up to and including the purchase of reusable face masks. Tardif, a captain who served in Afghanistan, has been at the forefront of an unusual grassroots campaign in Quebec — driven by the families of frightened health care workers — to mobilize the provincial and federal governments to requisition industrially-certified respirators from idled industries and suppliers. He spent over $800 out of his own pocket to equip his wife with personal protective equipment (PPE) for the daily battle against coronavirus. Guillaume Tardif has been scrambling to find protective equipment for the hospital where his wife works: \"She's the mother of my children and I'm going to make sure that I do everything possible for her to come home every night and us to get through this.\" (Guillaume Tardif) \"She's the love of my life,\" Tardif said in an interview. \"She's the mother of my children and I'm going to make sure that I do everything possible for her to come home every night and us to get through this.\ " (Staff at the hospital where his spouse works have been warned not to talk to the media and CBC News has agreed not to publish Tardif's wife name, or the name of the facility where she works.) Tapping into industrial supplies Other families in the medical community have followed Tardif's lead by buying up large stocks of industrial masks and respirators locally, and donating them. Earlier this week, the federal government announced an ambitious $2 billion plan to swiftly increase the stock of personal protective equipment for frontline health-care workers caring for critically-ill and dying patients. Quebec Premier François Legault said Tuesday the province has three to four days before it runs out of some personal protective equipment (PPE), but that the province has orders that are expected to arrive in the coming days.  The province went through a year's worth of PPE in a matter of weeks because of the surge in COVID-19 cases. The question of whether the federal stockpile of equipment is adequate has been on federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu's mind. Health Minister Patty Hajdu says that successive federal governments have for decades underfunded public health preparedness, resulting in an insufficient amount of personal protective equipment in the federal pandemic stockpile. 1:58 \"No we likely do not have enough,\ " she told the daily media briefing Wednesday.  \"I think federal governments for decades have been underfunding things like public health preparedness and I would say that obviously governments all across the world are in the same exact situation.\ " In all likelihood, it will be weeks before suppliers, old and new, can ramp up production of vital equipment such as medically-certified N95 masks, which many doctors and nurses throughout the country are being forced to ration and reuse. Tardif argues there is a large alternative supply of identical industrial-grade masks and respirators that can be requisitioned by the federal government and the provinces in the meantime. \"We need to take every chance to avoid running out of PPE and in my opinion that involves requisitioning every device that's out there,\ " he said. It's a good idea, says doctor Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said having the provinces or the federal government coordinate the collection of industrial protective equipment is a very good idea. \"I think it's absolutely useful,\ " Willmore said. \"I think it's a very important role, both federal and provincial, to be able to enact the appropriate legislative measures by which they can really dig down into industry and create a pool of resources that can be distributed equitably in a way that supports the health care system as a whole.\ " Both 3M, the manufacturer of the N95, and Health Canada have said industrial masks —  the kind used in construction, factories and paint shops, where fumes are a problem — are a suitable emergency substitute. Ottawa 'likely did not have enough' protective gear stockpiled: HajduAnalysisLike everything else in the pandemic plan, Morneau's economic package is chasing a moving target: Chris HallCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that major shipments of protective equipment, including millions of masks, have started to arrive — one shipment landed on Wednesday — and federal officials are in the process of conducting inventory and getting the equipment out to the provinces. \"We will be there to support the provinces and territories with whatever they need,\ " he said during his daily media briefing. \"This includes sending personal protective equipment and other supports for the health care system.\" The shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff was to be the subject of a teleconference between Trudeau and the premiers Thursday night. Willmore said the Ottawa Hospital has reached out to some local businesses in the hopes of laying its hands on an industrial supply. In other parts of the country, major industrial concerns have stepped forward. Honda Canada donated 1,200 masks to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, Ont., and a further 1,000 and 40,000 pairs of gloves to the Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston, Ont. ' A single point of failure' Tardif said his research suggests that's a fraction of the industrial stock across the country and it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and coordinate a nationwide drive. Shortages of protective equipment for health care staff in a pandemic create \"a single point of failure\" for the whole system because it either puts doctors, nurses and technicians in danger or leaves them unable to provide care, Willmore said, adding that \"the highest levels of government\" need to engage with the problem. It has been suggested that giving health care staff reusable respirators, such as the 3M-manufactured 6000, would help cut down on the use of disposable masks. Willmore said that depends on the environment and the patient being treated, noting that there's a danger involved in overusing some equipment.  Cost and availability are other factors. \"These are expensive pieces of equipment and they're difficult to source, especially since there's been a pull to purchase such equipment,\ " he said. \"It's certainly effective but there are practical limitations.\ "
  Health officials in Ottawa have been ramping up their efforts to track and contain potential cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, as the disease spreads. There have still been no positive cases of coronavirus reported in Ottawa.   Even so, officials with Ottawa Public Health (OPH) and the Ottawa Hospital have been on alert since January, preparing for the first positive case in the capital and what should happen if the number of cases grow. ' Just a matter of time' before coronavirus comes to Ottawa, top doctor saysSome supplies running low as coronavirus fears grow OPH says it's preparing to set up special assessment centres using community paramedics as a way of diverting people with questions about coronavirus from hospitals, as those facilities are likely to face increased demand during an outbreak. \"The emergency departments are busy. It's not the best place to send people who are well. There are sick people there,\" said Dr. Vera Etches, medical officer of health for the city. Darryl Wilton, president of the Ontario Paramedic Association, said paramedics are in an excellent position to treat people. \"What we don't want is a cluster of infected patients showing up in a place like a hospital and spreading it to everyone else in the waiting room,\ " Wilton said. Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said it's important people call public health before coming to the emergency room if they suspect they may have coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) The 'worried well' Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director for the department of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said many patients won't contract severe cases of the virus, which has symptoms similar to flu. Western Quebec couple who beat coronavirus back in Canada Willmore said the \"worried well\" have already started to appear in emergency rooms, but so far hospitals have been able to manage the increased demand. \"We really want to make sure that the folks who are feeling well enough to be at home have [somewhere] they can go other than the hospital, to save that for the patients that really need to be here,\ " he said. Dr. Kathryn Suh, associate director of the infection prevention and control program at the hospital, says staff are being equipped with yellow gowns, gloves, special respirators and plastic face shields. Patients with symptoms who have a reasonable connection to other coronavirus cases would be put into negative pressure isolation  — meaning a room that ventilates outdoors rather than circulating air back into the hallway — and a swab would be taken for testing, Suh said. Dr. Kathryn Suh explains how a tube on a ventilator would be used to treat a patient suffering from respiratory complications from coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) The hospital has 90 isolation rooms and will be moving patients around so that those with COVID-19 are contained.    \"We have some reserves for the first patient that comes that requires that isolation bed. We are keeping those areas available,\ " Willmore said.   \"Sometimes patients are in an isolation room because they're private rooms, but they don't require isolation.\ " Willmore said the Ottawa Hospital is well stocked with face masks and ventilators, and also has access to additional supplies through its partners. Both Willmore and Suh said people concerned about coronavirus should call OPH first. Public health calls increasing On Tuesday, public health nurses fielded several calls some from people concerned about whether they'd been exposed to coronavirus.  The number of calls have almost tripled from early to late Februrary — from 60 calls weekly to more than 160 — and continue to increase. Etches said in addition to monitoring for cases related to travel, OPH is starting to test people who present with respiratory illnesses to see if COVID-19 has entered the city undetected. Etches said public health nurses will retrace the steps of anybody who tests positive in an effort to contain the risk of exposure. Murielle Simplice, a public health nurse, says she's fielding more calls from Ottawa residents who are concerned about the spread of coronavirus. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) \"We are doing intensive case and contact management. That's our plan,\ " Etches said. \"We account for every minute of their day to understand if they may have exposed anybody else.\ " Etches said a team of between 20 and 30 is currently monitoring the situation, but more staff can be brought in from OPH's 200 nurses, or total staff of 500, if volumes increase.   The plan for schools OPH also has a plan in place to stem outbreaks in schools. Etches said if a child showed up to school coughing and then tested positive, health officials would remove them from class before deciding if the whole school needed to be closed.     \"We would work with the school to make sure we understand where the child has been in the school, which classrooms could be affected,\" she said.   \"[We'd also be] making sure that we clean the environment and then providing the right information to the families who might have been affected.\ " Etches said any decision on shutting down a school or workplace or restricting public gatherings — as has happened in other countries with coronavirus outbreaks — would involve consulting her provincial and federal counterparts. 
  A Vancouver Island woman with a compromised immune system is frustrated that she can't find any face masks due to what she sees as the public's \"unnecessary panic\" to safeguard themselves against the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \"The minute someone hears that somebody [might be] sick, they immediately think ' well, a mask will protect me,'\" said Marina McCaffrey of Colwood, B.C., who suffers from autoimmune hepatitis, which attacks her liver. \"I'm really frustrated because it feels like people aren't ... informing themselves properly,\ " she said Her doctor has recommended she wear a mask to protect herself around sick people — for example, on a visit to the doctor's office — and to have one to hand for someone she needs to interact with who is sick.  She also takes medication to manage her condition, and uses \"hand sanitizer by the gallon,\ " she said. But in the past week, McCaffrey tried finding masks at Home Depot, Lowe's and Slegg Lumber, and has had no luck. Pharmacies she visited were sold out of these items too. Shoppers stocking up in Metro Vancouver as concern about coronavirus spreads It means that she's now avoiding being out in public more than necessary, she said.   \"It's really important to think about everybody,\ " said McCaffrey, who's asking the public to talk to their doctors, call the 811 health line, and search online for more information before they panic-buy. \"It's our responsibility to really investigate and learn.\ "  Products snatched up within seconds Employees at stores in Greater Victoria say face masks and other protective products are getting snatched up within seconds of being stocked.   Colton Elder, an employee at Home Depot in Saanich, B.C., says customers are often lined up as workers unload new masks and sanitizer onto store shelves.   On the West Shore, Lowe's employee Ken Rimbey says a full shipment of masks are often gone by the end of the day, and says many customers pre-order online then ship them to their families overseas. He isn't expecting another shipment of masks for a couple of weeks, he said. Store employees in Greater Victoria says face masks and hand sanitizer are disappearing soon after being stocked. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) McCaffrey said her husband is also concerned about the mask shortage, given that he works in construction and is often required to purchase and wear protective facial equipment to prevent him from inhaling harmful substances like asbestos. She said she understands the panic but is still surprised, given  the B.C. Centre for Disease Control has stated that face masks often \"give people a false sense of security\" and can be less effective for a healthy person, as they're more likely to touch their own face while wearing the mask. B.C. identifies 3 more cases of COVID-19, bringing total to 12 B.C. seniors advocate Isobel McKenzie says elderly populations may also have compromised immune systems, though the shortage of protective gear hasn't yet taken its toll on care homes and hospitals, where \"supplies are on order from well stocked suppliers in advance.\ " \"There's quite a supply chain there,\ " she said, adding that people from the Ministry of Health would be tracking potential supply shortages. Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus To prevent the spread of illness, the BCCDC recommends people first and foremost  wash their hands and avoid touching their faces. 
  Alberta's supply of ventilators, intensive care beds and personal protective equipment should be sufficient to handle a projected peak next month in COVID-19 cases, according to modelling information released Wednesday. Under the most likely scenario, first revealed by Premier Jason Kenney in a televised address on Tuesday, Alberta would see as many as 800,000 confirmed and suspected infections and between 400 to 3,100 deaths by the end of the summer. The peak in cases is projected to occur in the middle of May. Under that scenario, the peak of hospitalization would be in late May, with about 818 Albertans requiring hospitalization. About 232 patients would be expected to require critical care by late May and early June. \"Modelling is an estimate based on the best known data at the time that the model is put together,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. \"But we will continue to adjust it based on emerging Alberta data and evidence. So you will ... see this model evolving over time.\" Albertans can help bring the numbers down further by following public health rules aimed at preventing spread of the virus, she added.   \"Changing our total infections in the province is in our hands,\ " Hinshaw said. \"Every action makes a difference.\"   The province updated its COVID-19 case numbers before the start of the news conference. Alberta reported 50 new cases Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 1,423. Three more deaths were reported, bringing the total so far to 29. There have been 519 recoveries. Ramping up health-system response As a precaution, Alberta is ramping up its ICU, ventilator and personal protective equipment capacity based on an elevated, but less likely scenario.   Under the elevated scenario, 1,570 Albertans would require hospital beds by the beginning of May, with 392 of those cases requiring intensive care.   The elevated model would see as many as one million infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. System couldn't handle 'extreme' scenario An extreme model, with 1.6 million infections and 16,000 to 32,000 total deaths was provided to show how the virus would have spread if Alberta had not taken mitigation measures like closing businesses, schools and public buildings, and encouraging people to stay home. Alberta's health system would not be able to handle this scenario.    The information released on Wednesday outlines the assumptions used by health officials to come up with their models.   The most likely scenario includes an assumption that each person with COVID-19 will infect one to two other people. Other assumptions include that not all cases will be detected, that there is no asymptomatic transmission, and that patients are infectious for 5 to 10 days.   For the purposes of health system planning, the scenarios assume all ICU patients will need the use of a ventilator and that generally, 14 per cent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, with five per cent needing time in intensive care.   Unlike other jurisdictions that have used data from other places to project the spread of the virus, Alberta is using data gathered through its own testing and surveillance. Officials say the models are fluid and will change as new information comes in. More ICU beds ready by late April Alberta plans to have an additional 1,081 ICU beds ready by the end of April, and another 447 ventilators, bringing the total number of ventilators set aside for COVID-19 patients from 314 to 761. The additional ventilators are coming from a number of sources, including the respiratory therapy programs at NAIT and SAIT, STARS air ambulance, private surgical facilities and the Public Health Agency of Canada.   Transport, anaesthetic and pediatric devices that can be used for mechanical ventilation account for another 305 units; another 65 are new purchases by the province.   The stock of personal protective equipment is more than sufficient through to the end of April and into May. Alberta Health Services is showing shortages for the month of June, but officials say that doesn't account for the orders expected to be filled by then.    The province is adding an additional 315 acute care beds by the end of April by measures which include postponing non-urgent procedures. Alberta Health Services intends to increase staffing in the ICU by ramping up training for nurses, hiring recently retired health care workers, and moving nurse graduates through their practicums so they can start working. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the government should be planning for a worst-case scenario and she repeated her call for the government to take over staffing of seniors' homes, and prevent employees from working at more than one site.   Notley is also concerned of reports from health-care workers that they are being encouraged to wash and reuse their N95 masks.   \"There's a shortage, we need to start being honest about that,\ " she said.   While AHS believes it has enough supply of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), AHS CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said they also have to be careful. Yiu said the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommendations for sterilization and reuse of N95 masks.   Kenney has asked AHS to \"go as big as they can\" in procuring supplies.  He said Alberta is prepared to share with other provinces if they get more PPE than required.   ' I hope the models are wrong' In an address to Albertans on Tuesday evening, Kenney outlined two possible scenarios for the pandemic in Alberta. Modelling suggests as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections could sweep Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney says OPINION | Kenney delivers a stark but necessary message to Albertans Under the \"probable\" scenario, Alberta would hit the peak of infections in mid-May. From the beginning of the outbreak to the end of summer the province could see up to 800,000 total infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths. Under a more serious but less likely \"elevated\" scenario, infections in Alberta would peak at the beginning of May, with as many as one million total infections and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. In his widely watched Tuesday address, Kenney said public health orders designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus may have to stay in place until the end of May. \"As hard as this will be, it is the only ethical choice when thousands of lives are still at stake,\ " Kenney said. \"To be honest, I hope the models are wrong.\ "
  Paris Semansky, her husband Mike, and newborn daughter Mira, born on March 22, are shown in a handout photo. (Peter Semansky/The Canadian Press) Jessica Bourke is 18 weeks pregnant and can't remember the last time she kissed her husband Ian. When Ian Bourke comes home from his job as a millwright in Calgary, he strips and showers and tosses his clothes in the wash before Jessica lets him near her, and they avoid physical intimacy because of her fear of catching COVID-19. Less than three weeks ago, Paris Semansky planned to give birth in the Toronto hospital that's just a four-minute drive from her house. But a \"switch flipped\" when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, and so Semansky decided from a \"risk mitigation perspective\" to give birth at home. Daughter Mira was born on March 22. Hannah Mitchell had enjoyed a problem-free pregnancy until COVID-19 put Toronto under lockdown, and when the 33-year-old admitted to a sore throat at a prenatal appointment last week, she was quickly masked and quarantined and then sent for a coronavirus test. The appointment was kept brief. Mitchell's doctor was dressed in full gown, gloves, mask and face shield. The test was negative.   Have you had a baby during the COVID-19 pandemic? Share your baby photos and stories with CBC Calgary at CalgaryPhotos@CBC.ca   Pregnancy and childbirth can be fraught with worry at the best of times, but the exploding global health chaos has cranked up fear and uncertainty to sky-high levels. Carefully drawn-up birth plans are being scrapped, and women have no idea what might be in store for them when they give birth in a chaotic world that is changing at whiplash pace. \"The unique aspects of prenatal care are the fact that we're dealing with two patients at the same time, and the risks for both patients really changes at each stage within the pregnancy and postpartum,\" said Dr. Dustin Costescu, an associate professor in McMaster University's department of obstetrics and gynecology. \"The other part that makes it a challenge is that prenatal care in particular with the birthing experience is something that a lot of patients and their families prepare for in advance.\ " One of the issues is distributing accurate information because it's changing rapidly. Costescu, who is also a practising obstetrician-gynecologist, said that within four hours last Friday he received two emails documenting major changes in practice because of COVID-19. ' Changing hour by hour' \"So the fact that it's changing hour by hour, let alone day by day, makes it very hard for us to give an overall assessment of what that birth experience will look like for a patient in the office and that also adds a level of stress for people,\ " Costescu said. Some 400,000 babies are born each year in Canada. A key part of pregnancy and childbirth that's changed is the number of support people allowed at appointments and in the delivery room. Bourke was told Monday her husband isn't permitted to come to her ultrasound appointment. \"This is hard for me because he still hasn't heard the heartbeat,\ " she said. \"I'm sure it's just as hard on him. You go into having a baby as a team, and half your team can't be there.\ " Laura Fournier is scheduled to have labour induced because of gestational diabetes on Wednesday in Calgary. She expects to be discharged within 12 to 24 hours to avoid staying in hospital unnecessarily. \"It is often safe to (send new moms home quickly) for a low-risk birth,\ " Costescu said. \"However, there is a higher rate of readmission for newborns. And so we do want to be careful because we don't want babies having to come back through an emergency department for reassessment.\ " Fournier is only permitted to have one support person — her husband — in the delivery room, and no visitors at the hospital or after they arrive home. How long they need to self-isolate, Fournier said, is anyone's guess. \"And then I'm worried about aftercare too, right? After you're home usually a nurse comes to your house and checks you out. Are they still gonna be doing that?\" she said. Mitchell, who is due April 9, had planned to have both her mom and husband in the delivery room. Now it will just be her husband Will. It's their first baby. \"It's the uncertainty of 'OK, when can family visit?' If you knew it was two weeks, then you could survive. But if you don't know how long then I think it makes it a bit harder.\ " Bourke is concerned about being isolated from her support group. She worries about postpartum depression. \"We're physical human beings, and we thrive on being around other people, and hugs, and being joyful and seeing other people's expressions,\ " she said. \"And my fiance is still working, so he's gone all day. So I'm basically by myself all the time ... it's going to be really hard.\ " Costescu said isolation is indeed a huge challenge. In Canada, women are more likely to die due to perinatal mood disorders, he said, than complications from pregnancy. \"Postpartum depression is a major contributor of morbidity and mortality,\ " Costescu said. \"And we know that when parents don't bond with their children early on, it can have long-lasting effects.\" Maintain virtual contact, doctor urges He urged new moms to maintain virtual contact with family members and friends, and to recognize when they need help and reach out to the health service workers. Costescu added that \"one could argue ... for another person to come stay with (new parents) to help look after the child or to provide respite, and so families need to decide what is the risk that they're willing to expose themselves to, to make sure that new parents and children are well cared for. And there's no right or wrong answer for that.\" Semansky's days are even more hectic since she and husband Mike have three-year-old daughter Anna at home who would normally be in daycare. \"The newborn is the easy part. The hard part is that keeping a three-year-old from crawling up the walls, and no one to help with that,\ " she said. Costescu said pregnant women can draw some comfort from the fact that they'll be well-served by labour and delivery nurses who know that things don't always go as planned, but will be with them every step of the way. \"That relationship develops very quickly with your labour and delivery nurse ...  we're still here for you, regardless of how many support people get to be there during the birth experience.\ " Semansky said her anxiety leading up to the birth was significantly higher than how she felt during the actual delivery or since. \"In the middle of all of this (chaos), there has been something kind of magical about life continuing, about meeting somebody that you love before they were here,\ " she said. \"And having people from all over — whether it's calling or texting or Facetiming — show how much they love you and love your family and love your baby and how much space there is for newness and happiness and how much energy that gives people.... \"In the middle of something that feels really scary and really hard, having this little bit of light is pretty special and normal and wonderful.\ " 
  Colby Charles scanned the streets of Shenzhen, China, his mask over his mouth, looking for an open shop where he could get his hair cut. \"I walked all around my neighbourhood. Couldn't find one salon open,\ " the Manitoban said over Skype on Friday. Manitoban Colby Charles wears a mask while in public in China to help stop the spread of coronavirus. (Submitted by Colby Charles) Businesses are closed in coronavirus-hit China and the government has instituted temperature checks and use of an app that says who people are, where they've been and whether they're sick.   \"The government can kind of track where everybody is going and where they've been so that if there is another breakout, they know who has been around and who to quarantine,\ " said Charles, who's from Manitoba's Oakbank-Dugald area.   This is what life in China is like for Charles and Tommy Allen — two Manitobans who don't plan to leave the country as the government tries to slow the spread of the sometimes deadly coronavirus, which is centred about 1,000 kilometres north of Shenzhen in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A trip to a government office to process the visa that allows him to live and work as an English teacher in China was the first time Charles had to check into a building by getting his app scanned. The app tracks people's names, phone numbers, passport numbers, addresses and whether they've been sick, Charles said. There's another app that Charles said he doesn't use, which can notify users if they have been near someone infected with the coronavirus. \"If I went to a supermarket , I signed [into the app] at a supermarket, and then the same time that I was at the supermarket there was a person there with the virus, they would maybe let me know, or they would quarantine anybody that was in the a supermarket at that time,\ " Charles said.   A tent is set up outside Manitoba-born Tommy Allen's friend's apartment in Shenzhen, China, where someone checks the temperature of people who go in and out of the building. (Tommy Allen) In addition to the app, Charles has to have his temperature checked every time he enters and exits his apartment building. \"It kind of looks like a little handgun kind of thing and they just, it's like a laser, and they press a button and the laser sensor takes your temperature,\ " Charles said. Numbers rising  The number of people diagnosed and dying from the disease, which is officially known as COVID-19, is climbing every day. More than 73,000 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, including 32 Canadians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship near Tokyo.  More than 1,800 people have died from the disease, the World Health Organization said in a situation report Tuesday.   The Canadian government advises people to avoid non-essential travel to China because \"there is an extreme risk to your personal safety and security.\" Canadians in China also are advised to consider leaving while it's safe to do so, and to avoid large crowds, avoid sick people, avoid contact with animals and to wash their hands and monitor their health. Manitoba teachers will remain This is the third year Charles has lived in China and he's not planning to leave unless the potentially deadly disease impacts Shenzhen more.   So far there have been 1,300 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Guangdong, the province where Shenzhen is, and which has a population of more than 113 million people, the World Health Organization report said Tuesday. \"I feel like as long as you're staying on top of sanitation, wearing the mask, washing your hands, that sort of stuff, and avoiding public places, it shouldn't be an issue,\ " Charles said. WATCH |  Colby Charles describes how the Chinese government tracks public health: Colby Charles says the government in China makes everyone wear a mask, get their temperature checked and, in some cases, sign into an app that tracks their location and health. 0:35 For now, some restaurants and businesses have closed and fewer people walk the streets. Charles said he would be more concerned if his city was in lockdown or if he heard of more people in Shenzhen diagnosed with the coronavirus. Until then, Charles plans to be in China for another couple of years to work and save money. \"I have some financial goals that I want to hit and being in China helps me realize those , so I feel like I can still do that at the moment, so I'm going to keep pushing towards that,\" said Charles, who blogs about his experiences living and working in China.   \"This is where I live. This is how I make a living at the moment, so I'm going to see it through,\ " Charles said. \"If it got to the next stage , then maybe I'd re-evaluate, but for now, it seems OK to be here.\ " School closures worry Winnipegger Allen is considering leaving China, but not exactly out of fear of the coronavirus. He left Winnipeg to teach in Shenzhen 1½ years ago. He teaches art at a primary school but classes are delayed until at least the beginning of March, and he's wondering how much of a financial hit he'll take.    \"There's a big question in terms of whether the schools will be paying teachers for that delay or not, and whether they will be invited to do online teaching or not,\ " Allen said. Winnipegger Tommy Allen has been teaching in Shenzhen, China, for a year and a half, and might consider leaving if the start of the new semester continues to be delayed to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.   (Tommy Allen/Skype) He was supposed to return to work last Wednesday.   \"A lot of teachers are worried, including myself, worried about how it might affect our pay, especially if the government delays the in-person classes even past the beginning of March.\"   If Allen's salary is affected, he will consider looking for work in a nearby country or even back in Canada, after he weighs the costs of all those options.   Allen's friends and family back in Winnipeg have asked him to reconsider living in China. \"They mostly advise me to consider leaving, which I am considering, and I have considered, but I'm going to wait a bit longer,\ " he said.   \"If things do get worse or if work gets further delayed … I would probably go back home and go from there.\"
  In Toronto's bid to stop the spread of COVID-19, city officials announced a new bylaw Thursday that prohibits people from standing within two metres of each other in some parts of the city — and failing to comply could mean a fine of up to $5,000.   Mayor John Tory, joined by Toronto's medical officer of health and fire chief, announced the change at their daily news conference on the city's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The bylaw, which will remain in effect for at least the next 30 days, is limited to interactions in city parks and squares.  That's where city officials say they are seeing the most problem with crowding.  It's also limited to two or more people who don't live together.   \"Lives are potentially at stake and we'll turn up the heat,\ " Tory said. \"We will continue to do everything we can as a municipal government to lock down the city to save lives.\ "  Watch Tory speak about the new bylaw:  Toronto Mayor John Tory said the bylaw will be in effect for at least the next 30 days. 1:36 Despite the new bylaw, questions remain around where people should and shouldn't go in the city.   Can Torontonians go for a jog, walk the dog, or stroll through the park during the COVID-19 pandemic? According to public health officials and elected leaders, the answer for now appears to be: it depends how many other people are doing the same thing. The enhanced restrictions and recommendations released by Toronto Public Health on Wednesday advise people to limit their time outdoors to essential trips, but the guidelines still allow for walking pets or getting daily exercise so long as physical distancing of two metres is possible. Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders was asked by reporters today how officers will enforce a new city bylaw that makes it illegal for people to be standing within two metres of each other. Saunders also addressed if officers would wear protective equipment. 1:51 Toronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa described those non-essential outings as \"reasonable things to do while trying to stay home as much as possible.\ " But Tory pointed to crowded parks, singling out Sunnyside Park on the lakefront, to suggest that some residents are not taking the rules seriously enough. \"It's not saying you can't go outside , it's just saying that in places where people congregate, they can't do that right now,\ " Tory said on Metro Morning.

(Christopher Mulligan/CBC) Amenities are closed, but parks are not While the city has closed a variety of outdoor amenities such as washrooms, off-leash dog areas, sports fields and picnic areas, other green spaces within parks and ravines are still open to the public. When asked by a CBC Radio listener unsure about what to do when those spaces are crowded, Tory suggested residents look for quieter areas off the beaten path. \"They can take their car to a side street,\ " he suggested. \"I have not heard a lot of complaints about people saying side streets are crowded.\" Tory said he was particularly concerned by reports of drivers removing gates blocking parking lots at city parks in recent days. Some parts of Toronto's downtown core have been easier to navigate on foot and bike since governments started urging people to practise physical distancing. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) He suggested the city would start using the large concrete barricades to keep drivers out. He said they will be the same barriers the city previously used to block access to unlicensed cannabis stores last summer. \"We have to respond accordingly,\ " Tory said. Toronto announces stronger measures in 12-week plan to stop COVID-19 spreadCity prepared to impose fines up to $5K on those who don't respect park closures De Villa has said she's continuing to encourage residents to practice physical distancing, though both she and Tory have increasingly reminded residents about the grim situations unfolding in other parts of the world. \"Turn on your TV, have a look at what's going on in New York and decide together with us: we don't want to go there,\ " Tory said. TTC not implementing caps on passengers   The TTC, meanwhile, says it has not implemented caps on passengers per vehicle.   \"While we agree 10 to 15 customers is a reasonable number, we would rather operators continue to focus on moving our customers safely than on counting heads,\" TTC spokesperson Stuart Green said in a statement.   The TTC is instead adding additional buses to the busiest routes so there's fewer customers per vehicle, Stuart said.   Eaton Centre service restricted  With Eaton Centre access restricted to only essential services, the mall said it implemented \"additional safety measures.\ "  But that still doesn't explain boarded-up store fronts, which have been popping up around Eaton Centre's perimeter.   \"We did not make any changes to store fronts.  You would have to speak with the retailer about their store front,\"  CF Toronto Eaton Centre said in a statement.   
  A group of Manitoba researchers say they've found a way to safely decontaminate and reuse some types of medical masks that are normally thrown away after each use. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global shortages of personal protective equipment for health-care workers, including N95 respirators and masks. A team of five Manitoba researchers released a study Wednesday that tested decontamination of four types of masks, finding some success. Led by Dr. Anand Kumar, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, the study said preliminary results suggest some masks could be successfully decontaminated and reused up to 10 times using common sterilization techniques. \"It became apparent in the early course of the epidemic that we were going to burn through personal protective equipment quite rapidly,\ " said Kumar, who also works as a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre and has a background in infectious diseases. Shortages reported Medical masks are designed to filter out aerosol particles, with the N95 providing the best protection against tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. In the early stages of the pandemic, shortages of N95 masks and other personal protective gear were being reported, Kumar said. Dr. Anand Kumar says the sterilization methods his team tested could help to address the global shortage of N95 masks. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) \"Physicians and other health-care workers were having to use their masks and other equipment for days on end, which is specifically recommended against,\ " he said. Ottawa Hospital rationing surgical masks to avoid shortageCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market That prompted the physician to start exploring ways to reuse masks, which are often discarded after each patient and may only be worn for a few minutes each time. About 10 days ago, Kumar's team began experimenting with four types of masks that were available within Winnipeg, using four different types of sterilization methods. Working 18-hour days, the team assembled a paper that has been submitted to a medical site that shares preliminary results with others around the world.   Some masks recycled up to 10 times The goal of the study was to see if the masks could be successfully decontaminated without losing structural integrity or effectiveness. Two of the methods, Kumar said, successfully allowed for multiple cleanings with no loss of function in terms of filtering ability. One of those methods, using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, was very effective in decontaminating all types of masks while preserving their effectiveness, Kumar said. However, he added the technology is only available in a few places in North America A more common method, autoclaving, which is found in nearly every hospital setting, was also very effective, he said. \"[Autoclaving] is like a pressure cooker — basically you enclose items into a chamber, you lock down the chamber, you heat it up and actually increase the pressure inside the chamber,\ " Kumar said. The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. \"It'll sterilize anything.\" Kumar said one type of pleated mask that was tested was safely decontaminated up to 10 times using autoclaving, a standard disinfecting tool that uses heat to sterilize hospital equipment. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) \"The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,\ " Kumar said. \"And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face… they're called pleated [ masks],\" he said. ' Ready to go right now' Kumar said the pleated fabric masks can be cycled through an autoclaving machine 10 times and come out as good as before. \"The reason this is really important is that autoclaves are available at literally every established hospital in the world. There is probably no hospital in the world that doesn't have an autoclave machine,\ " Kumar said. \"So everybody can use this for these particular types of masks and these particular types of masks are probably the most common type of N95 mask , so we're really pleased.\" Kumar said the technique could be put into use at any hospital at any time. \"It's a technology that's available and ready to go right now.\ " Kumar found certain fabric masks, like the one above, can be cleaned successfully using the autoclave method. (Submitted by Dr. Anand Kumar) In order to test the masks in a hospital setting, the team used a non-pathogenic virus as a stand-in for COVID-19, Kumar said. Further testing was carried out at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which used the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one responsible for COVID-19. The study is based on preliminary testing results and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. ' Other people need to test it' Kumar noted that the testing was done using only the four kinds of masks inside a lab using surface contact with the viruses. The methods haven't been tested with masks that have actually been worn by health-care workers in the field. \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health-care workers, with stress and perspiration, can inflict,\ " the study states.

That depends on how you clean them. 4:16 Kumar said he wouldn't recommend heavily worn or soiled masks be decontaminated, but said many masks could be suitable for the process.   \"A lot of times when we use a mask we may put on the mask and go into an ill patient's room, work for three or four minutes, come back out and then you might discard the mask,\" he said. Mask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more actionHome care workers worry about shortage of protective equipment during pandemic: union \"Those are the masks that you want to consider reprocessing. But as I said, if that mask is otherwise damaged or showing substantial signs of wear and tear, then that's probably not one you want to recycle.\ " Kumar hopes at the very least health-care systems could start saving the masks to be decontaminated later, should the need arise. He also said others may want to replicate his results before implementing them.   \"I think it works, my team thinks it works, but in science, before you accept something as being true, it's got to be duplicated, so other people need to test it and find that they agree with us.\"
  Guillaume Tardif, a soon-to-be-retired army tank officer, quietly but frantically combed the internet in January as coronavirus reports coming out of Wuhan, China became more alarming. Even then, he was convinced a viral storm was approaching and was determined to do everything possible to protect his wife, a Montreal emergency room physician — up to and including the purchase of reusable face masks. Tardif, a captain who served in Afghanistan, has been at the forefront of an unusual grassroots campaign in Quebec — driven by the families of frightened health care workers — to mobilize the provincial and federal governments to requisition industrially-certified respirators from idled industries and suppliers. He spent over $800 out of his own pocket to equip his wife with personal protective equipment (PPE) for the daily battle against coronavirus. Guillaume Tardif has been scrambling to find protective equipment for the hospital where his wife works: \"She's the mother of my children and I'm going to make sure that I do everything possible for her to come home every night and us to get through this.\" (Guillaume Tardif) \"She's the love of my life,\" Tardif said in an interview. \"She's the mother of my children and I'm going to make sure that I do everything possible for her to come home every night and us to get through this.\ " (Staff at the hospital where his spouse works have been warned not to talk to the media and CBC News has agreed not to publish Tardif's wife name, or the name of the facility where she works.) Tapping into industrial supplies Other families in the medical community have followed Tardif's lead by buying up large stocks of industrial masks and respirators locally, and donating them. Earlier this week, the federal government announced an ambitious $2 billion plan to swiftly increase the stock of personal protective equipment for frontline health-care workers caring for critically-ill and dying patients. Quebec Premier François Legault said Tuesday the province has three to four days before it runs out of some personal protective equipment (PPE), but that the province has orders that are expected to arrive in the coming days.  The province went through a year's worth of PPE in a matter of weeks because of the surge in COVID-19 cases. The question of whether the federal stockpile of equipment is adequate has been on federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu's mind. Health Minister Patty Hajdu says that successive federal governments have for decades underfunded public health preparedness, resulting in an insufficient amount of personal protective equipment in the federal pandemic stockpile. 1:58 \"No we likely do not have enough,\ " she told the daily media briefing Wednesday.  \"I think federal governments for decades have been underfunding things like public health preparedness and I would say that obviously governments all across the world are in the same exact situation.\ " In all likelihood, it will be weeks before suppliers, old and new, can ramp up production of vital equipment such as medically-certified N95 masks, which many doctors and nurses throughout the country are being forced to ration and reuse. Tardif argues there is a large alternative supply of identical industrial-grade masks and respirators that can be requisitioned by the federal government and the provinces in the meantime. \"We need to take every chance to avoid running out of PPE and in my opinion that involves requisitioning every device that's out there,\ " he said. It's a good idea, says doctor Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, said having the provinces or the federal government coordinate the collection of industrial protective equipment is a very good idea. \"I think it's absolutely useful,\ " Willmore said. \"I think it's a very important role, both federal and provincial, to be able to enact the appropriate legislative measures by which they can really dig down into industry and create a pool of resources that can be distributed equitably in a way that supports the health care system as a whole.\ " Both 3M, the manufacturer of the N95, and Health Canada have said industrial masks —  the kind used in construction, factories and paint shops, where fumes are a problem — are a suitable emergency substitute. Ottawa 'likely did not have enough' protective gear stockpiled: HajduAnalysisLike everything else in the pandemic plan, Morneau's economic package is chasing a moving target: Chris HallCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that major shipments of protective equipment, including millions of masks, have started to arrive — one shipment landed on Wednesday — and federal officials are in the process of conducting inventory and getting the equipment out to the provinces. \"We will be there to support the provinces and territories with whatever they need,\ " he said during his daily media briefing. \"This includes sending personal protective equipment and other supports for the health care system.\" The shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff was to be the subject of a teleconference between Trudeau and the premiers Thursday night. Willmore said the Ottawa Hospital has reached out to some local businesses in the hopes of laying its hands on an industrial supply. In other parts of the country, major industrial concerns have stepped forward. Honda Canada donated 1,200 masks to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, Ont., and a further 1,000 and 40,000 pairs of gloves to the Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston, Ont. ' A single point of failure' Tardif said his research suggests that's a fraction of the industrial stock across the country and it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and coordinate a nationwide drive. Shortages of protective equipment for health care staff in a pandemic create \"a single point of failure\" for the whole system because it either puts doctors, nurses and technicians in danger or leaves them unable to provide care, Willmore said, adding that \"the highest levels of government\" need to engage with the problem. It has been suggested that giving health care staff reusable respirators, such as the 3M-manufactured 6000, would help cut down on the use of disposable masks. Willmore said that depends on the environment and the patient being treated, noting that there's a danger involved in overusing some equipment.  Cost and availability are other factors. \"These are expensive pieces of equipment and they're difficult to source, especially since there's been a pull to purchase such equipment,\ " he said. \"It's certainly effective but there are practical limitations.\ "
  Health-care workers make up roughly one in every 10 of the known COVID-19 cases in Ontario, totalling 229 lab-confirmed cases to date, CBC News has learned. The finding is ringing alarms as hospitals across Canada are bracing for an expected surge in patients with the potentially deadly respiratory illness — which comes amid ongoing concerns over potential shortages of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers. \"We need all hands on deck,\" warned Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital.  \"And we need all those health-care workers working, because we're expecting to see a greater number of patients in the hospitals and clinics in the next few weeks ahead.\" The Ministry of Health provided the data on Wednesday in response to an inquiry from CBC News.   It reveals 9.6 per cent of the province's 2,392 confirmed COVID-19 cases involve physicians, nurses, paramedics, personal support workers, long-term care home staff and members of other health-care professions. Provincial officials did not provide a breakdown of Ontario's confirmed cases involving health-care workers by specific roles, transmission source or region. High number in Toronto, Ottawa, Waterloo, York CBC News reached out to each of the province's 34 public health units for more context on local confirmed health-care worker cases. Multiple health units from less-populated regions declined to provide numbers, including Chatham-Kent Public Health, which cited potential privacy concerns given the small number of total cases reported there to date. AnalysisOntario clinicians bracing for 'surge' of COVID-19 patients — but exact timing hard to predict The public health unit from Peel region said roughly 30 of the area's 362 confirmed COVID-19 cases work in health-care settings or front-line care. Waterloo region said 28 of the area's 117 confirmed cases are health-care workers.  In Ottawa, there are 28 health-care workers and first responders out of 194 cases, while in York region, the count is 26 out of 325 cases.  In Peterborough, it is 12 out of 28. Each unit uses different metrics to tally positive cases in the health-care profession, with some focusing only on workers involved directly in patient care, and few offering precise breakdowns by role. ' We need all hands on deck,' warns Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital.   (Maggie MacPherson/CBC) As for Toronto, the latest numbers show that out of at least 818 total known cases to date, at least 31 front-line workers have contracted the virus so far — including 12 physicians, 13 nurses and six other health-care workers. Earlier data suggested a higher count, but public health officials are now reporting only patient care roles. \"The majority of these cases of COVID-19 are travel-related,\" noted Toronto Public Health spokesperson Lenore Bromley. Bogoch said the fact that travel is the primary transmission source, rather than a clinical setting, gives some \"peace of mind.\ " But he cautioned that some cases are already health-care-related, a situation that could worsen if workers aren't properly protected. \"There still is some rationing of personal protective equipment and we have to take care of that issue right now,\ " he said. Concerns over equipment rationing, shortages As CBC News recently reported, some Toronto hospitals are rationing surgical masks and even urging nurses and other front-line staff to use just one mask for an entire shift, according to internal memos. Health-care workers and advocates have raised concerns over looming shortages of the full range of protective gear. ' The impact on the health care system could be total collapse,' warns ICU doctor \"My worst fear is that [the province] will continue to be fairly inactive on the file. It didn't order enough equipment,\" said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions with CUPE, which represents roughly 90,000 workers across the health-care system, including registered practical nurses, paramedics and personal support workers. Many hospitals are already \"running low,\ " Ontario Hospital Association President and CEO Anthony Dale warned in a Wednesday news release, which called on both the federal and provincial government to outline timelines when fresh supplies will be delivered. Members of the public wait to be tested at a COVID-19 assessment centre located at Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) In a statement, Ontario Ministry of Health spokesperson Travis Kann said the province is investing $75 million to supply personal protective equipment and critical medical supplies to front-line staff. The province expects to deliver supplies in the days and weeks ahead, including 12 million more sets of gloves, one million more N95 respirators and nearly six million more surgical masks, which would be on top of the millions of masks and thousands of ventilators the federal government is also ordering. 40 dead from COVID-19 in Ontario nursing and retirement homes \"The health of all Ontarians, including and especially the brave heroes working on the front lines to stop the spread of COVID-19, is our top priority,\ " Kann said. Long-term care a 'nightmare environment' Hurley worries it's not coming fast enough. \"We're already seeing in hospitals and long-term care people who are acquiring this illness at work,\" he said. \"We're going to see those numbers go up significantly.\" Long-term care in particular is a \"nightmare environment\" in which outbreaks are already happening, Hurley stressed. Clinicians and advocates have raised red flags about potential shortages of personal protective equipment at Ontario hospitals. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) In recent days, eight residents of the Seven Oaks Long Term Care Home in Scarborough have died as result of COVID-19 amid an outbreak at the facility, according to Toronto Public Health. Province-wide, more than 40 deaths of residents in nursing and retirement homes have been linked to the illness so far, and at least 41 facilities for seniors in the province are currently experiencing outbreaks — defined as one lab-confirmed positive test involving a resident or staff member.    Second Opinion'They were completely unaware': Why mass COVID-19 testing is key to stopping spread The latest numbers show case counts keep rising more broadly, alongside crucial metrics revealing a growing number of patients hospitalized in Ontario's intensive-care units. The province confirmed 426 new cases on Wednesday, marking a nearly 22 per cent increase in the total number of infections and the largest single-day jump since the outbreak began — bringing the total of known cases to 2,392. CBC InvestigatesSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 Ontario ICU beds A CBC News investigation also found there are now at least 430 patients in intensive-care unit beds who either have tested positive or are suspected of having COVID-19. Given the rising number of patients needing high levels of medical care, the number of health-care workers already ill is \"upsetting,\ " Bogoch said. \"We can't afford them getting sick.\ "
  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.

For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask? Your COVID-19 questions answeredMask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more action There also is limited evidence that healthy people wearing masks reduces the community spread of diseases, like COVID-19, as public health officials have been saying, but some acknowledge that's partly because studies haven't been done. A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places. CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisisYour guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada The researchers also said that for cultural reasons, masks are considered a hygienic practice even for healthy people in Asia, while in North America it's considered something only sick people do.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  Some local politicians are considering large fines for people caught discarding used gloves and masks in public, with several sightings of the disposable items littering streets around Metro Vancouver. Medical professionals say it is thoughtless and irresponsible behaviour, as the items present a real danger of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.   \"It's not only littering it's also selfish,\" said Vancouver Coun.  Pete Fry. \"If they're contaminated enough that you don't want to put them in personal garbage, which obviously people aren't doing, then you're really sort of passing the problem onto someone else.\" B.C.'s top doctor stops short of recommending widespread mask use, but says they can protect others Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart echoed Fry's words in a Facebook video. \"If you think something is contaminated, leaving it for others is about the most selfish thing you could do,\" he said, adding that the city is considering hefty fines.   The City of Vancouver said it may do the same if the situation gets worse. Neither municipality determined how much any potential fine would be.

  While experts say the risk of exposure is currently low for Manitobans, questions were raised Wednesday about the level of preparedness on First Nations in the province for dealing with the novel coronavirus. A panel of public health specialists held a public forum at the University of Manitoba on Wednesday afternoon to answer questions about the impact of the new virus on people and communities in Canada, and throughout the world.

Its leadership is working with all levels of government to initiate plans in communities, and will provide more information in the upcoming days, according to a press release issued after Wednesday's panel. \"First Nations have an increased susceptibility to outbreaks due to social determinants of health, poverty factors and overcrowding housing conditions that make it easier to spread community-wide,\ " Grand Chief Arlen Dumas said in the release. Risk of coronavirus for Manitobans still low after global health emergency declared2 Manitobans test negative for coronavirus, health minister says Dr. John Embil is an infectious disease control specialist at Health Sciences Centre, who understands why people are worried about the new virus being introduced to their communities. \"We don't know what's coming at us and when it's coming at us, but we've got a number of protocols in place so that if we are faced with something … there are policies and practices in place,\ " he said. Dr. John Embil, who specialises in infectious disease control, stresses the need for basic practices to prevent the spread of germs. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) Embil said health officials won't be caught off-guard. While similar infection control measures are still in place, hospitals are ramping up to prepare for the worst. \"What we're trying to do locally is reinforce basic approaches to keeping well and preventing the spread of germs as you would normally do.\" Fear stokes discrimination Case numbers are increasing in China and in Hubei, the Chinese province at the centre of the epidemic. The number of cases of the new coronavirus has climbed to more than 24,600 worldwide, with close to 500 deaths.

(Jeff Stapleton/CBC) According to Prof. Kevin Coombs, a microbiologist in the University of Manitoba's infectious disease department, the biggest concern is that the virus is still new to everyone. He said it could be a \"flash in the pan\" or the \"tip of the iceberg,\" as the public health situation continues to evolve. \"To put all of this in context, in the amount of time that this particular event has occurred, about 100 times as many people have died from influenza,\" Coombs said. \"Even more have died from HIV or tuberculosis or malaria.\ " Several Winnipeg medical supply stores sold out of face masksBy the numbers: Coronavirus outbreak charted
  Providence Health Care has changed the way it manages its face mask supply, as coronavirus concerns have led people to seek N95 protective masks. The organization, which operates medical facilities including Vancouver's St. Paul's and Mount Saint Joseph hospitals, has increased monitoring of its masks and has also sent a memo reminding staff of appropriate mask use. \"These specialized masks are only worn by our health-care workers for specific procedures in which aerosol sprays may be generated,\ " a Providence spokesperson told CBC News. The healthcare provider said it has centralized its N95 mask distribution in order to keep a closer eye on it and make sure it has adequate safety equipment for staff. However, Providence said it is not experiencing a shortage of N95 masks, nor has it confirmed any reports of theft.

  While Sudbury police officers continue to work on the front lines, many of their procedures are looking different, in light of COVID-19. \"To say that, you know, everything has changed is almost a understatement,\ " said Chief of Police Paul Pedersen.   For weeks now, Pedersen said, officers have no longer been patrolling in pairs. Meetings at the start of shifts are also now done virtually, in an effort to maintain physical distance as much as possible.    Shift times have also been staggered, and some employees are working from home. ' Risks of the unknown' While officers try to keep physical distance as much as possible on the job, that isn't always possible, given the nature of the job. \"When you have to arrest somebody, you have to break that social distancing barrier,\ " Pedersen said, as well when pulling over drivers for speeding, or any other number of duties that come with the job.   Paul Pedersen is the chief of the Greater Sudbury Police Service. (Markus Schwabe/CBC) \"The risks to our front line people were always there and still continue to be there, but now the risks include those health risks of the unknown.\ "  Pedersen said officers have been supplied with personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves. There is also increased cleaning of equipment and facilities.   One positive case Pedersen said a number of staff members have been tested for COVID-19, and one person has tested positive — with the test results confirmed in recent days.   He said the staff member had not been in direct contact with the public, and had not been in the workplace recently.   Northeastern Ontario nursing homes see themselves as 'ground zero' for COVID-19Helping people affected by opioid crisis even more challenging amid COVID-19 While Pedersen said the service has been generally lucky so far when it comes to COVID-19, it is thinking ahead about what will happen if multiple officers need to self isolate — and how that would affect staffing. Some employees are already working from home, and Pedersen said that may be expanded.   \"Now we're moving into the phase where we are looking at what consideration can be given to allowing some of our sworn members to do some work from home, but staying away from the workplace so that they can fill in down the road. And I'll just say that at this stage it's a work in progress,and something we're working towards.\ " The work of police officers always carries a certain amount of risk but that risk level is higher these days, amid COVID-19.

  As P.E.I. starts examining what an easing of public health measures will look like, the province says that both public and private long-term care facilities are well-stocked with the personal protective equipment needed to fight COVID-19. This comes after Dr. Heather Morrison said Tuesday that for a rollback of the public health restrictions to occur, private and public long-term care facilities on the Island would need to have access to the proper personal protective equipment (PPE).   Marion Dowling, P.E.I.'s chief of nursing, reported back Wednesday that the public and private facilities are both well-stocked and said the province has a stockpile of PPE that private facilities can access.   \"They've been acquiring some personal protective equipment such as masks and gowns and gloves for a number of health services including private long-term care,\ " she said.   \"And our public long-term care facilities have also received their allocation of that protective equipment.\ "  Some P.E.I. long-term care facilities restrict employees to working in one homeNursing homes close dining rooms as COVID-19 precautions increase Dowling said that the province is also making sure the private facilities are aware they can acquire PPE from the central storage location, and ensure those facilities continue to have it on hand.   Some of the private long-term care facilities on the Island said they're feeling more confident about the levels of PPE available to them. ' Enough on hand to get us to May' Ramsay Duff, CEO of the MacLeod Group, said between the company's two long-term care facilities on P.E.I., he has 2,000 surgical masks available for staff with an additional 1,000 on the way.  The group runs South Shore Villa in Crapaud and Clinton View Lodge in Kensington. \"We do feel we certainly have enough on hand to get us to May. And that would be the period that we'd be most concerned about,\ " he said.   Ramsay Duff, CEO of MacLeod Group, says the company's Kensington facility, shown here, and its Crapaud facility have enough PPE to get through to May.   (Submitted by Ramsay Duff                                                                                                         ) And in the long term, Duff said he's becoming less concerned with the available supply of PPE.   \"The initiatives that the federal government and the provincial governments are completing around procurement do appear to be stabilizing supply and inventories,\" said Duff.    \"I'm much less concerned from May 1st going forward than I have been in the last number of weeks and into the early part of this month,\ " he said.   ' I was very concerned' For the Mount Continuing Care Community, being able to access the provincial stockpile has provided some relief. The facility was having difficulties sourcing the required amount of surgical masks from its traditional supplier, said Lindsay Dickieson, administrator of the Mount Continuing Care Community.   \"I'd say up until about 10 days ago I was very concerned,\ " she said.   Lindsay Dickieson, administrator of the Mount Continuing Care Community, says having access to the provincial stockpile of PPE has helped fill the gap left by her traditional supplier. (Laura Meader/CBC) Their supplier was telling Dickieson that orders were going to take longer to arrive, or that the Mount might receive fewer masks in their shipment than ordered. But, Dickieson said being able to access the provincial stockpile has helped ensure the facility will have access to the PPE that it needs.   \"I do feel better about our levels of PPE and certainly what we have in stock, but then what we're able to replenish as well,\ " she said.   Dickieson's biggest concern is the availability of masks.   She said the Mount has moved to using reusable PPE where it can, like gowns and goggles.   Increased measures On April 21, the province released guidelines for long-term care facilities on the Island, which mandate all staff in long-term care facilities wear a mask for the duration of their shifts.   And even though the supply of masks is at an acceptable level at the MacLeod Group, Duff worries what might happen if the guidance from the Chief Public Health Office changes.   \"We could in fact move from just masks to what they call full PPE, or full protective equipment, and that would involve additional pieces of equipment like facial shields, goggles and gowns,\ " he said.   Duff said his company does have a supply of those types of equipment, but much fewer than the masks currently being worn. \"We would want to be working very closely with the chief public health officer around inventory for those items,\ " he said.   COVID-19: What you need to know What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

  When the crisis is over, there will be tough questions to be answered and explanations to be sought over how so many leading countries found themselves short of masks and other life-saving protective equipment. For now, the Western world must contend with the consequences of their lack of foresight: including the unsightly \"mask wars\" that have pitted neighbouring countries, even U.S. states and levels of government, against each other in the rush to acquire them — prompting accusations of modern piracy. The country most often accused of undercutting the efforts of its allies in the so-called mask wars is the U.S., which not only attempted to halt exports of U.S.-made N95 masks to Canada and Latin America last week, but also stands accused of scuttling European deals to purchase them in China and elsewhere. But it isn't the only country out for itself. With the outbreak of the mask wars across shuttered Western borders, and alongside outright bans of exports of medical equipment, any hint of a unified global effort to fight the coronavirus is absent, beyond the work of scientists cooperating on a possible vaccine. U.S. allies complain of 'Wild West' tactics in race for medical supplies'We'll do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe,' Trudeau says amid U.S.-Canada mask dispute The selfishness isn't a surprise under the circumstances, but the apparent desperation of some of the wealthiest countries on Earth is. It's a revelation that has justifiably raised eyebrows in less fortunate parts of the world, where some are now bracing for a similar spike in cases but with a fraction of the resources. Selfishness striking, says professor The cutthroat tactics of the mask wars risks making this crisis worse for everyone. Rich countries on the front lines of the melee have learned early lessons about the vulnerability of their supply chains and about their neighbours and allies. What the competition looks like when the number of infected and dead rises further in the weeks to come is unsettling to contemplate.

(Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune via AP) \"It's normal for countries to take care of their own citizens first,\" says Roland Paris, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But the selfishness and lack of coordination among leading countries, he says, \"is striking.\" Instead of an international response \"we're unfortunately seeing a mad scramble to grab whatever's available, to hell with the other guy.\ " WATCH | Trudeau slams Trump's order to halt N95 masks to Canada: 3M says an order aimed at keeping masks made by the company in the U.S. amid the shortage brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic could have humanitarian implications for the other countries it supplies. 1:58 Closest to home, \"to hell with the other guy\" translated into Trump ordering Minnesota-based company 3M to halt exports of its masks to Canada and Latin America, using his authority under the Defence Production Act. The move caught Canada off guard, while the company pushed back against the order. European countries have shuttered their borders, with some like Italy and Germany among others cancelling deals to sell equipment to neighbours or blocking shipments at the last minute.   Even more stark, the mask wars have seen American and other buyers scuttling European and Brazilian deals, some even snatching shipments already promised to other jurisdictions by outbidding them—even \"on the tarmac\" as planes prepared to take off. Some shipments reportedly just disappear. Lasting damage Among a number of examples, officials alleged that 200,000 masks en route to Germany were intercepted in Bangkok to redirect them to the U.S., prompting Andreas Geisel, the interior minister for the state of Berlin, to call it an \"act of modern piracy.\" The details of the disputed case are still murky and the company, 3M, has said it had no indication of any wrongdoing. Trump insisted there had been \"no act of piracy.\ " WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19?

European Union officials wouldn't comment on the specific allegations but called for better international co-operation. \"Now is the time for international solidarity and leadership, not isolation,\" said Brice de Schietere, chargé d'affaires of the EU delegation to Canada.   The everyone-out-for-themselves behaviour prompts yet more questions: if this cutthroat competition is happening over protective equipment and tests, what happens when there's a vaccine? Reports in the German press that the U.S. was seeking exclusive access to a possible vaccine in development by a German company was an early ominous sign.    President Donald Trump this week released an epidemiological model projecting a pandemic death toll in the U.S. ranging between 100,000-2.2 million, depending on public mitigation measures.

Naturally, the countries that suffered most — and waited the longest — were the poorest. Plenty of lessons It's proving the same in the struggle to find and buy masks.

There is little indication that will happen during this crisis. There is little evidence to indicate much cooperation among western countries at all. But there have been plenty of lessons. The Associated Press reported that Spain, which has suffered more than 130,000 infected and more than 12,000 dead, has started three weekly flights to China, the world's largest manufacturer of masks.

Many countries and regions will realize \"they made a mistake in being so reliant on one unique global supply and that they want to, at the very least, diversify their sources of supply to avoid that problem in the future.\" The European Commission is centralising the stockpiling of ventilators, masks and other equipment to help member states, said de Schietere, and is, for the first time creating a European reserve of emergency medical equipment. It's also looking at other measures that could increase the EU's self-reliance, including the repurposing of existing factories For Canada, the \"sad lesson,\" says Roland Paris, \" is that we can't rely even on our closest partner. \"For better or worse, that lesson that will guide Canada's future decisions about supply chains and stocks of vital medical supplies.\"
  After downplaying the effectiveness of non-medical face masks, both the chief public health officer and federal health minister now say they would wear them in cases where physical distancing isn't possible in public. Theresa Tam, the country's top doctor, said Tuesday that while the scientific research \"is not quite there\" yet on the effectiveness of non-medical masks in stopping the spread of COVID-19, she wouldn't hesitate to use a mask when grocery shopping or riding transit. \"That's one option,\ " she said of wearing a mask. \"It is an added layer of prevention and protecting the spreading to others.\" Minister of Health Patty Hajdu looks on as Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam responds to a question during a news conference in Ottawa. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Tam has suggested a t-shirt or bed sheet could be fashioned into a homemade mask. But medical-grade masks should be strictly reserved for health care professionals, given the ongoing shortages, Tam said. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said she hasn't had to wear a mask to this point because she's been able to maintain that two metre distance between herself and others — but she would wear one if it meant protecting others in confined spaces. UpdatedMasks and COVID-19: When, how and why you'd wear themCanada working to produce up to 30,000 ventilators domestically: Trudeau She said she would probably feel the need to \"fiddle with that mask, given the newness\" — which is one of the public health risks associated with wearing a mask. There are concerns that wearing a mask might encourage people to touch their faces more than they normally would, which also could lead to infection. Watch: Dr. Tam, Hajdu say they will wear masks when in public Canada’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Theresa Tam and Health Minister Patty Hajdu say they'd wear masks when in public in cases where they're unable to maintain physical distancing to protect others. 1:41 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today he will follow the advice of medical professionals on the mask question.  He said homemade masks are a sensible solution as they essentially act like a shirt sleeve — a place to catch a cough or sneeze without spreading it around. \"My understanding of what Dr. Tam explained yesterday is that if people want to wear a mask, that's OK. It protects others more than it protects you, because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them.\ " (The prime minister cringed visibly after the words \"speaking moistly\" left his mouth.  \"Oh, what a terrible image,\ " he said.) Watch : Trudeau says masks will prevent people from 'speaking moistly'   While he points out that he's not a medical expert, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he understands that masks can help protect people from \"breathing or speaking moistly\" on others. 1:15 While Canada's two top health authorities said they'd wear masks while in public, they cautioned that masks should be worn in conjunction with pursuing other hygiene practices, such as frequent hand-washing. The commitment to wearing non-medical masks in public comes after the Public Health Agency of Canada changed its recommendations on the medical devices Monday. While Tam and other public health officials have discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, the public health officer said Monday that homemade masks might actually help to slow the spread of COVID-19 as they can catch wayward droplets from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people. \"It's not necessarily there to protect myself. I think there has to be that reality check. I still have to do the hand-washing and still do the physical distancing as much as possible,\ " Tam said. \"I think that is reasonable and feasible advice.\ "
  Health officials say there are enough protective face masks for health-care workers in the Northwest Territories to last \"several weeks,\" but they are bracing for the increased demand that would come with an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the territory. Known as N95 masks, the white paper masks are a key piece of protective equipment for doctors and nurses working on patients with the novel coronavirus. They filter out the microdroplets that transmit the highly contagious virus when someone with it sneezes, coughs or even speaks. There is a North America-wide shortage of N95 masks. On Saturday, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer authorized the use of a framework adopted in British Columbia last month to decide who gets masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) when it is in short supply during a pandemic. Dr. Kami Kandola also authorized the Department of Health to go to the fourth of six stages of prioritization in the framework. Jurisdictions move to the fourth stage when they are within days of running out of one or more items of PPE. \"We are not actually implementing at Stage 4,\ " Dr. Sarah Cook, the medical director for the N.W.T. Health and Social Services Authority, told reporters at a briefing Wednesday. \"Dr. Kandola authorized that we could implement Stage 4. That doesn't mean we are or have to implement at Stage 4.\ " As N.W.T. prepares for next phase of COVID-19, medical director says physical distancing still keyRunny nose? Cough? You too can get a COVID-19 test in the N.W.T. Kandola said she authorized the use of the B.C. framework and authorized the health authority to enter Stage 4 in order to be ready to act if need be. \"It's always been a proactive approach,\ " she said. \"I don't wait for a situation to deteriorate.\" Limiting use of masks Cook said there are enough masks to last \"several weeks\" at the current rate of usage, also known as the \"burn rate.\ " Dr. Sarah Cook said officials are trying to find new sources of N95 masks in case COVID-19 cases go up in the territory. (Caitlin Cleveland photo/GNWT) She said health authorities are now in the process of implementing continuous masking, which saves doctors and nurses from having to put on a new mask each time they see a new patient. But not all people treating patients are using N95 masks. \"Because we don't have community transmission yet and we are trying to preserve PPE for when we do need it, we're not at a stage of providing PPE for everyone who is providing care within two metres,\" said Cook. N95 masks are being used by doctors and nurses performing procedures known to generate microdroplets, such as inserting a tube in a patient's mouth and throat during surgery, or using an inflating bag and a mask to help someone who is having trouble breathing. Meanwhile, surgical masks — a looser-fitting mask that helps block large-particle droplets or splashes — are being used when treating patients with risk of COVID-19, and for other normal medical procedures such as surgeries, explained the health authority in a subsequent email Thursday. \"If we have community spread and we need to go to continuous masking for anyone within two metres of a patient, that's going to change the burn rate,\" said Cook. The health authority added in an email Thursday that continuous masking is currently being implemented in two settings — with long-term care and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Reprocessed masks in wide use in U.S.: medial director Cook said officials are trying to find new sources of the masks in anticipation of an increase in the number of cases. Doctors and nurses have not yet been asked to reuse their single-use masks. Cook said they may be asked to use recycled masks. \"We're actively looking at that as an option, but it's not in place at this time,\ " she said. Alberta Health Services collecting, cleaning used N95 masks for possible reuseSask. researchers say they successfully decontaminated test run of N95 masks for reuse Asked if recycled masks are as effective as new N95 masks in screening out microdroplets, Cook and Kandola would say only that \"they're safe\" to use. \"That's a very technical question,\" said Cook. \"The information I've been given is it is safe to use if it's gone through the appropriate reprocessing process.\ " Kandola said reprocessed masks are in wide use in areas of the U.S. where supplies of the masks are low. 
  Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan say they successfully decontaminated a small batch of N95 respiratory masks for reuse last week. The goal of the process is to create an emergency backup supply of N95 masks, in partnership with the province, for hospitals to use during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the event of a mask shortage. \"This is a critical initiative that we hope will save lives and protect our health care providers,\" said Volker Gerdts, director of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre  (VIDO-InterVac) at the U of S. N95 masks can be decontaminated for reuse between five and 10 times, according to Gerdts. He added that the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) has set the limit for decontamination at five times. VIDO-InterVac could probably decontaminate up to \"a couple thousand\" masks per week, Gerdts estimates. The process itself takes about two-and-a-half days. NDP calls for Sask. government to co-ordinate manufacturing of non-medical masks for publicSask. man on a crusade in search of masks, protective equipment The thing that takes up the most time is waiting for validation of biological indicators used to ensure that the procedure worked. Gerdts said the process could be extended to other personal protective equipment (PPE) and is an excellent contingency plan for potential shortages. Four staff members at VIDO-InterVac have volunteered time to assist in the decontamination process, he added. The only cost is the transportation of the masks, according to the PPE task force for the SHA. Existing medical staff throughout the province are collecting masks. \"It's important that we have backups to backups to backups,\ " said Dr. Michael Kelly, co-chair of the task force. It's too early to determine just how far the process could extend supplies in the province, Kelly said. Any masks reintroduced into the work force will be preceded by a public announcement from the province if it gets to that point. 
  Some local politicians are considering large fines for people caught discarding used gloves and masks in public, with several sightings of the disposable items littering streets around Metro Vancouver. Medical professionals say it is thoughtless and irresponsible behaviour, as the items present a real danger of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.   \"It's not only littering it's also selfish,\" said Vancouver Coun.  Pete Fry. \"If they're contaminated enough that you don't want to put them in personal garbage, which obviously people aren't doing, then you're really sort of passing the problem onto someone else.\" B.C.'s top doctor stops short of recommending widespread mask use, but says they can protect others Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart echoed Fry's words in a Facebook video. \"If you think something is contaminated, leaving it for others is about the most selfish thing you could do,\" he said, adding that the city is considering hefty fines.   The City of Vancouver said it may do the same if the situation gets worse. Neither municipality determined how much any potential fine would be. Doctors say discarded masks and gloves can contain the coronavirus if the wearer has COVID-19 or has touched a surface carrying the virus. \"Multiple particles of the virus [could be] on there and can be for days, and the poor soul who has to dispose of garbage will be exposed,\" said Dr. Mayam Zeineddin, a doctor in Vancouver. Doctors say littered masks and gloves can present a danger if the wearer has COVID-19 or has touched a surface carrying the virus. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Doctors say masks should be taken off from the back first, while gloves should be removed from the inside out before they are thrown safely in the garbage. Users should then thoroughly wash their hands. If you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at impact@cbc.ca.   
  At a Chinese-run hospital in Zambia, some employees watched as people who recently returned from China showed up with coughs, but were not placed in isolation. A doctor tending to those patients has stopped coming to work, and health workers have been ordered not to speak publicly about the new virus that has killed hundreds around the world. The virus that has spread through much of China has yet to be confirmed in Africa, but global health authorities are increasingly worried about the threat to the continent where an estimated one million Chinese now live, as some health workers on the ground warn they are not ready to handle an outbreak. Countries are racing to take precautions as hundreds of travellers arrive from China every day. Safeguards include stronger surveillance at ports of entry and improved quarantine and testing measures across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and some of the world's weakest systems for detecting and treating disease. But the effort has been complicated by a critical shortage of testing kits and numerous illnesses that display symptoms similar to the flu-like virus. \"The problem is, even if it's mild, it can paralyze the whole community,\ " said Dr. Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the World Health Organization. Mining city in Zambia has ties to Wuhan Those growing worried include employees at the Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital in the mining city of Kitwe in northern Zambia, near the Congo border. Chinese companies operate mines on the outskirts of the city of more than half a million people. One company is headquartered in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the virus outbreak. Hundreds of workers travelled between Zambia and China in recent weeks. \"We're definitely not prepared. If we had a couple of cases, it would spread very quickly,\" physiotherapist Fundi Sinkala said. \"We're doing the best we can with what resources we have.\" The Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital, or Sinozam, a low-slung facility near the city's train station, has taken some precautions, including checking patient temperatures with infrared thermometers and establishing isolation areas. Employees wear masks. Gloves, disinfectant and oxygen inhalers have been stockpiled. Sinozam treats many Chinese in Kitwe and its precautions go further than other hospitals in the area. Symptomatic patients not placed in isolation But the employees and others familiar with the matter, some of whom spoke anonymously under the new rules, say some Chinese patients checked in with coughs and fevers but did not get placed in isolation. Visiting Zambian health officials concluded the patients did not merit special treatment and did not take samples to test for the virus. After the people recovered, they were sent home with antibiotics, employees said. What we know so far about the coronavirus On Wednesday, the hospital set up a new fever clinic, where people arriving with a high temperature are now taken right away. It's \"unfortunate\ " the ward wasn't set up earlier, Sinkala said. Two people familiar with the matter say a doctor tending to the sick has fallen ill. Dr. Yu Jianlan has not come to work in the past week and hospital administrators have not explained her absence, Sinkala said. The other person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

(Seyllou/AFP via Getty Images) Hospital administrator Li Zhibing said there were no patients with a fever and said Yu had a urinary tract infection, not a fever. But a notice posted by the Zambia-China Co-operation Zone, which manages the hospital, quoted an employee as saying on Jan. 27 that the facility \"probably sees 120 fever patients a day, and at least 70 of them are carrying germs\" of various diseases. Earlier this week, a Zambian official acknowledged for the first time that his country was following up on an unspecified number of suspected cases. Zambia is one of 13 African countries identified by WHO as a high priority because of busy travel links with China. Copperbelt provincial health director Dr. Robert Zulu, who oversees Kitwe and the surrounding region, told The Associated Press he would not discuss details, citing privacy. But he added, \"when any case is confirmed, you will be informed.\" Lack of ability to test for virus Crucially, no one in Zambia has been able to test for the virus so far. Like most African countries, it has been waiting for a substance known as a reagent, which labs require to confirm whether a patient is infected. Labs in just six of Africa's 54 countries were equipped as of mid-week. That means a wait of two or more days to know whether a sample shipped to South Africa or even outside the continent tests positive. Without testing, officials are \"just relying on the symptoms\" and whether they persist. \"But from what we are learning right now, some people show hardly any symptoms at all,\ " Sinkala said, calling that the hospital's biggest worry. China's coronavirus death toll surpasses number of global fatalities from SARS Zambia is one of the additional countries WHO planned to equip by the end of the week. As of Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said 28 labs across the continent could diagnose the new virus. Adding to concerns at Sinozam, three employees say Zambian health officials visited on Tuesday and have been testing the bodies of two Chinese patients that have been in the morgue for days, though some added it was out of an overabundance of caution. Li, however, dismissed the accounts of testing the bodies as \"rumours.\ " He said one died last month of malaria and the other of a heart attack. The bodies are still there because family members in China wish to come and pay respects but cannot because of the outbreak, he said. ' Pointless to hide information' Zambia's health ministry spokesman, Dr. Abel Kabalo, called the employee accounts of events at the hospital \"very strange.\ " He vowed that if Zambia confirms a case, authorities \"will definitely inform the world.\ " It's \"pointless to hide information,\ " Kabalo said. The WHO says countries are obligated to inform it of any confirmed cases and are requested to report suspected cases as well. The WHO chief has publicly urged countries to share information. So far, African countries appear to be complying, a WHO adviser on health security, Dr. Ambrose Talisuna, told reporters. 5 Britons contract coronavirus at French ski resortAs China deaths hit 722, WHO warns of global shortage of coronavirus protective equipment Several African nations such as Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia have announced their precautions, including updates on negative test results for suspected cases and demonstrations of surveillance and quarantine capabilities. Ethiopian Airlines, however, faces questions by some in Africa about why it continues to operate more than 30 China flights a week while other African airlines have suspended theirs. Adding to the difficulties in diagnosing the new virus are numerous diseases in Africa with symptoms that include fever or coughing or both. ' Significant likelihood' virus will spread to Africa It's impossible to diagnose the new virus by symptoms alone, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said, adding that there is a \"significant likelihood\" that the virus will be confirmed in Africa. And there is a risk that \"panic overtakes good public health and good science.\ " The foundation has committed up to $20 million US to help health authorities in Africa and South Asia, another vulnerable region, improve their disease surveillance, isolation and treatment for the virus. No Canadians airlifted from China showed coronavirus symptoms during flight: Hajdu Concerns are high among some in Kitwe. A local pharmacy manager, Edward Goma, estimated that his business had sold more than 800 face masks in the past few days. \"So far everyone is scared,\ " he said. And yet he has not noticed the stricter surveillance measures seen in other countries, beyond temperature checks at the international airport an hour's drive away. The 15th Metallurgical Construction Group, based in Wuhan, said on its website that its overseas operations in Zambia and Congo must purchase masks, disinfect living quarters and workspaces daily and check workers' temperatures three times a day. Chinese employees are temporarily barred from returning to Africa, while those in Zambia are not allowed to go to China, said Li, the hospital administrator. Chinese embassies in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa have been unusually outspoken, giving news conferences and television interviews to discuss their response to the outbreak. Embassies require arriving Chinese citizens to declare where they have been in China. They also urge citizens to voluntarily isolate themselves for 14 days. \"We are now practising hygiene, even in the mines,\" said the Kitwe-based president of the Mine Workers Union of Zambia, Joseph Chewe. \"Any report of a person with coronavirus here will be very disastrous.\ " The virus has killed more than 720 people and infected over 34,500 since late December, with most cases being reported in China.

New pandemic models suggest the outbreak in Ontario may be peaking earlier than expected — as long as people keep adhering to physical distancing rules. That means the province could see fewer than 20,000 cases of COVID-19 instead of the 80,000 predicted earlier this month.

How many cases are there? There are now 857 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa and nearly 1,500 in eastern Ontario and western Quebec. The deaths of at least 32 people in Leeds, Grenville and Lanark counties, 25 in Ottawa and three more in the wider region have also been tied to COVID-19. The vast majority of the deaths are seniors.    From what we know, more than 450 people out of that regional total have recovered, but most local health units don't share that data. Confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the actual number because of limited testing. Distancing and isolating Physical distancing remains in effect: avoiding non-essential trips, working from home, cancelling all gatherings and staying at least two metres away from anyone you don't live with. Anyone who has symptoms, travelled recently outside Canada or, specifically in Ottawa, is waiting for a COVID-19 test result must self-isolate for at least 14 days.

(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) In Ontario, anyone in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to have COVID-19 must also self-isolate for 14 days. Ontario also recommends people older than 70 and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health issues go into voluntary self-isolation.   How daily life is changing Passengers on domestic flights must now wear non-medical masks covering their nose and mouth. Municipal parks are only open to walk through, provincial and national parks are closed and authorities are watching for gatherings in many communities. Ottawa has cancelled event permits and closed many facilities until July. Quebec has asked organizers to cancel events until September.

Schools in Ontario and Quebec are closed until at least May and non-essential businesses should be closed.   What are the symptoms of COVID-19? They range from a cold-like illness to a severe lung infection, most commonly fever, fatigue and a dry cough. Recently added symptoms include a sore throat, runny nose and less common symptoms such as the loss of taste or smell. Older people, those with compromised immune systems and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious problems. If you have severe symptoms, call 911.

  As coronavirus cases continue to rise, more Canadians are being asked to to self-isolate at home — for two weeks at a time — if they are symptomatic, have been diagnosed with COVID-19, are returning from an area that's experiencing an outbreak, or have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with the illness. CBC explains what that means. Why are people told to self-isolate at home? The majority of COVID-19 cases in Canada have been mild, health officials say.  People who are only mildly ill are asked to isolate at home to ensure hospitals can maintain the capacity to treat and manage more severe cases, if required. How are authorities ensuring these people aren't going out into the community? Is it an honour system? Local public health units regularly check in with people who have confirmed cases to ensure they are abiding by guidelines for self-isolation.  In addition, medical officers of health have statutory powers they can use to enforce self-isolation if they believe people are not following quarantine orders. Will you get paid if you self-isolate for coronavirus? It dependsCOVID-19: Why are cruise ship passengers quarantined and not self-isolated at home? If someone is found to be non-compliant with any of the conditions for self-isolation at home, they could face significant fines and penalties under the Quarantine Act, a spokesperson with the federal Public Health Agency of Canada said. Can they leave the premises? People in self-isolation are asked to stay at home, unless absolutely necessary, such as to seek medical care. They should arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at the door. More people are being asked to self-isolate at home if they are symptomatic, have returned from an outbreak area, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or come in contact with someone who has. (John Minchillo/Associated Press) Can relatives, housemates stay in the home of someone in self-isolation? Yes, however, health officials advise that any person in self-isolation should avoid contact with others — keeping a distance of at least two metres — and wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth. Officials also advise staying in separate rooms and using separate bathrooms if possible. How about pets? The Public Health Agency of Canada says there is currently no evidence to suggest that any animal native to Canada (wild, livestock or pets) harbours the virus that causes COVID-19, and animals in Canada don't pose a risk of infecting people with the virus. Still, the agency recommends that, until more is known about human to animal transmission, patients infected with COVID-19 who also have a pet or other animal should avoid close contact with them.    (CBC News)   What about the use of household items? People in self-isolation are asked to avoid sharing household items, including dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding and other objects, PHAC says. Any special guidelines for cleaning? PHAC says that at least once daily, individuals in self-isolation should clean and disinfect surfaces they touch often, such as toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs, light switches, phones and television remotes. Regular household disinfectants are fine. International travellers ordered to avoid schools for 2 weeks amid COVID-19 outbreak: memo Contaminated items that cannot be cleaned should be placed in a lined container and disposed of with other household waste. 
  Premier Jason Kenney announced Saturday the province would be sending personal protective equipment or PPE to other provinces battling COVID-19. Kenney made the announcement from an Alberta Health Services (AHS) warehouse while espousing the province's readiness for the pandemic. \"Our numbers are far lower than the hardest hit areas of Europe, the United States and significantly lower than we've seen in provinces like Quebec and Ontario,\" he said.   Kenney said Alberta is so far outperforming the probable scenario of models released earlier this week, which predicted as many as 800,000 infections. \"We are at about one quarter of the modelled levels under the probable scenario for today, and that is very good news,\ " he said, adding it was not reason to halt collective efforts to stop the spread.   Seven new COVID-19 deaths in Alberta, highest daily number so far What you need to know about COVID-19 in Alberta on Saturday, April 11   Kenney said the numbers supported the belief that Alberta would have beds and medical equipment beyond its need. According to the news release, Ontario will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2.5 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves. 87,000 goggles. 50 ventilators.   Quebec will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves.   British Columbia is set to receive 250,000 N95 masks. The premier also gave an update on COVID-19 cases in the province, adding 69 confirmed cases to bring the provincial total to 1,569. There are 216 cases suspected of being acquired in the community.   He also reported an additional death from the McKenzie Towne continuing care facility in Calgary, bringing the total number of deaths at the facility to 18.

In the Calgary zone, 28 died from COVID-19, seven in the Edmonton zone, four in the North zone, and one person has died in the Central zone. Forty-seven Albertans were hospitalized — one fewer than on Friday — and 13 in intensive care units. A total of 774 people have recovered, according to the premier. The province is also making it a requirement for continuing care workers to wear masks at all times when providing direct patient care or working in patient-care areas, starting next week. ' The right thing to do' Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Alberta's modelling indicates the health-care system can handle the peak of the disease. By the end of April, Shandro said, AHS would have 2,250 acute care beds, almost 1,100 ICU beds, and 760 ventilators — more than double the current count. He said the province had recently signed contracts valued at more than $200 million, including for millions of gowns and N95 masks. Shandro said the province is in a position to ensure Albertans' health as well as support other Canadian health-care systems. \"This is the right thing to do,\" he said at the press conference. \"I assure all Albertans that we will have ample supply.\ " The province says the equipment will begin shipping next week. 
  As more countries report confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, Nova Scotia tourism operators face a challenge: how to attract thousands of international visitors while authorities work to  minimize the chance of a traveller spreading the coronavirus. As of Wednesday, more than 81,000 people have been sickened worldwide by the coronavirus, with most of the cases and deaths happening in China. \"I think Nova Scotia is well-positioned right now because the public health authorities are saying the risk in our area is exceptionally low. We certainly have that in our favour,\" said Michele Saran, the CEO of Tourism Nova Scotia. The outbreak of the virus in China and the news that some airlines are cancelling flights there has challenged one of the agency's goals for 2019-20, which is to increase visitors from China from fewer than 5,000 in 2018 to 50,000 by 2024. The Chinese government ordered a temporary halt to tour sales in late January, trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Tourism Nova Scotia's Michele Saran says the province has a goal of attracting 50,000 Chinese tourists by 2024. (Robert Short/CBC) \"When we're talking about our Chinese visitors, they tend to book their holidays about six weeks out and they tend to look at late summer, early fall,\ " Saran said. \"It's a little bit early to speculate on that. Obviously, we're hoping the situation gets resolved quickly, though.\" Late last year, the province announced two direct charter flights from mainland China to Halifax scheduled for September and October 2020. Saran is still expecting those flights will sell out. The vast majority of visitors to Nova Scotia continue to come from the United States and elsewhere in Canada. \"I believe this is a short-term thing,\" Saran said. \"China is such a strong market, I do believe it will bounce back.\" Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief medical officer of health, said the coronavirus may become like influenza, which is a worldwide virus that is managed and controlled every year. However, he explained public health officials must have plans in place for worst-case scenarios. Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer, says the coronavirus may become like influenza, which is a worldwide virus that is managed and controlled every year. (CBC) He met Tuesday with federal public health officials to discuss those plans, including the need for a federally-led strategy on what would happen if the virus arrived on board a cruise ship. \"That's a huge task when you look at the size of some of our cruise ships, but we need to start doing the planning and preparing for that,\ " he said. On Tuesday, the Port of Halifax released its schedule for the 2020 cruise ship season, which begins on April 11 and runs into November. The port said it's expecting more than 200 vessels carrying approximately 350,000 people. Port spokesperson Lane Farguson said the port has followed news about the coronavirus outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan. Lane Farguson, a spokesperson for the Halifax Port Authority, says the port is following the news about the coronavirus closely. (CBC) \"We're working with our partner agencies to understand what all of this means for Halifax,\" he said. \"At this point there haven't been any operational changes here as a result of what's happening globally, but it is something we're paying very close attention to.\ " Any decision to quarantine a vessel or passengers rests with the Public Health Agency of Canada. A spokesperson for Halifax Stanfield International Airport said in an email that plans are in place if a flight landed with ill passengers, but the airport is not prepared to release details yet. Canadian international airports continue to ask screening questions about whether visitors have travelled to areas with outbreaks, and can send sick passengers to a quarantine officer.

  When a stranger told Jeongock Choe to \"go back to China\" Thursday as she shopped for vegetables, she said that she started to shiver and cry, then decided to fight back. The pregnant Choe was wearing a medical mask while shopping at a downtown Vancouver grocery store when a stranger shopping beside her made the racist comment out of nowhere, she said. \"I started shivering and I started crying because I never, ever thought that would happen to me in Vancouver after living here 10 years,\" said Choe. Choe believes she was targeted, as some other Asian-Canadians have been, in the wake of the global coronavirus outbreak which originated in Wuhan, China. She's convinced the mask she was wearing also made her a target. Store employees in Greater Victoria say face masks and hand sanitizer are disappearing seconds after being stocked. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) Health historians and experts say fear of the novel coronavirus is elevating some of the darker human emotions, such as xenophobia, suspicion and fear of shortages.   Infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy of the University of Toronto and other experts urge people to stay calm and stop stocking up on medical-grade N95 mask supplies needed by health-care providers.

Tiffany Sung of Vancouver called out a couple who baited her in Montreal on Thursday night. Sung had to cancel a recent trip to Taipei, Taiwan, because of the coronavirus outbreak. So she and her friend headed to Quebec instead. Last night on their way to a pub in Old Montreal the two women noticed somebody knocking \"aggressively\" on a restaurant window as they passed. \"They were knocking and signalling to the text on the window,\" said Sung.  At first she didn't realize what was happening, then she read the text. Tiffany Sung was walking by this restaurant in Montreal on March 2 when two strangers began knocking furiously on the window, pointing to this sign. Sung says she feels she was singled out because she is Asian. (Tiffany Sung/Facebook) In white marker somebody had scrawled: 'No Corona Virus Here!' \"I was kind of immediately furious,\" she said.  \"I told him loud and clear that the writing is totally inappropriate and he was being racist by singling me out.\ " Things escalated and Sung left as she thought the pair were drunk and the conflict could turn dangerous. \"I kind of suspected this exists everywhere. On a walking tour of the city our tour guide said go to Chinatown and support the businesses, because they are really suffering and you know why. [Coronavirus] was just implied.\" she said. Sung is considering making public her Facebook post of the Montreal couple to shame them. She said the scrawled insult on the window was soon erased, but the fact she was singled out for simply walking past is a memory seared into her mind. 
  As COVID-19 spreads in Canada, the advice from medical professionals on how to stay safe has evolved.   At first, Canadians were told to wash their hands and avoid large groups. Within weeks, they were locked down in states of emergency and told to keep their distance from anyone not in the same household.   The federal message about masks has also changed. They're now considered reasonable in public settings such as public transit and grocery stores, where physical distancing can be hard to maintain. But health officials urge people to wear non-medical masks, such as bandanas, scarves and home-made masks, and to  save the medical supply of surgical masks and N95 masks for health-care workers. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now. Here are your top questions answered by chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell.   4:39 In New Brunswick, the advice has shifted too.   The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, initially said that only health-care workers needed to wear masks. Now she is now matching federal advice and suggests masks may be a handy tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19. N95 masks should be used by healthcare workers only. They come in different sizes to make sure the barrier is tight.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) \"We are suggesting that if you are going to wear a face covering that it be the homemade kind,\ " Russell said. The masks aren't for your protection, explained Russell, but for the protection of others, and to make sure your droplets aren't getting on other people. \"This does not replace hand hygiene and it doesn't replace social distancing,\ " she said. Mask-wearing should not replace hand-washing, says Russell. You should also wash your hands before donning your home-made mask and after removing it. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Russell said mask-wearing can help combat community spread of COVID-19. \"We do understand that there is a risk of transmission in those settings,\ " she said. \"We don't believe that it's the driving force of the transmission, but we know we can play a part and this is just one of those precautionary pieces of advice that we're giving people.\" \"Arming people with knowledge, arming people with information so they can take good proper steps to protect themselves and others … is really important.\ " When should you wear a mask?   Russell suggests wearing a mask in public, especially in places where you can't properly maintain two metres of distance between yourself and others.   \"Running errands, grocery shopping,\" she said.   If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate, call 811 or your doctor, and generally refrain from going out in public. But if you have a slight cough, or seasonal allergies, a mask might help protect the spread of any germs or droplets.   \"If you're wearing a facial covering it means that if you do cough, not only do you have the protection of your elbow but it's going to be trapped in the fabric somewhat,\ " she said. What about at work? As to whether you can and should wear a face covering at work, Russel said \"that would be something that you'd have to work out with with your employer.\ "  If you can't maintain two metres of distance while at work, a face-mask might be a good tool to use. But, Russell added, employers should also ensure social distancing i the workplace is happening, too. What's the difference between medical and home-made masks?   N95 masks and surgical masks are used by health-care workers who are on the front lines in hospitals around the world.   N95 masks come in different sizes so as to provide the best barrier against germs. They sometimes come with a filter on the front, and are purpose-built to solely protect the user from small particles. If you have a supply of surgical masks like these, Russell says there's nothing stopping you from using them, but she hopes people will consider donating them to the province.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) Surgical masks are also used in lower-risk health-care settings. They are typically made with three layers of fabric to filter any germs or larger respiratory particles, and they are disposable. N95 masks are in high demand around the world, said Russell, so it's important to leave them for healthcare workers.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) These are not the masks the public should be buying or wearing though, said Russell. N95 masks are in high demand, and stockpiles in hospitals around the world are getting low, which is why it's so important to save these masks for nurses and doctors.   Russell said even if you have a pre-existing medical condition, don't buy a medical mask. Distancing, isolation, and hand-washing measures are the best way to keep yourself safe.   \"People who are wearing the homemade facial coverings, they are doing their part in terms of protecting those people who are at higher risk,\" she said. Where can you get one?   Russell said non-medical masks can be made at home, and she pointed to resources from the Centers for Disease Control. Some people have even shared mask-making patterns on Pinterest, said Russell. \"Whatever pattern you choose, however you decide to make it, whether it's a sewn one or one that's not sewn, there have to be no gaps around your face. So when it is fitted onto your face there can't be any big gaps,\ " she said. Some sewers suggest using quilting fabric or fabric in a double-layer to make the masks, but you can even use an old T-shirt, according to the CDC. Masks made at home should be large enough to cover your mouth and nose, and should have no gaps on the sides.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) The mask should also be comfortable, said Russell, otherwise you won't want to wear it. It should also be large enough to cover both your nose and mouth.   If you currently have a stock of surgical masks, Russell said there's nothing stopping you from using them, but would rather see people donate them to the province's stockpile.   More information around how exactly to donate to that stockpile will be coming out very soon, said Russell.    How do you use it?   The mask should fit comfortably on your face and around your ears and should have no visible gaps. \"Wash your hands when you put it on, and wash your hands when you take it off,\ " said Russell. Masks like this one can be worn in public places where maintaining two metres of distance is difficult, like on public transit or in a grocery store.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) It's also important to wash the mask every day, or else germs will just stay on the fabric.   \"I would not want people to just wear these facial coverings without making sure that they're doing proper hand hygiene and actually washing the material that the mask is made of,\" she said. As for how to clean the masks, hot, soapy water should do the trick, but other cleaning advice is available online.   \"If you washed it in hot soapy water at a good high temperature that would suffice,\ " Russell said. \"But there could be other cleaning advice as well that you would find resources for.\ "

Canadian hospitals should not throw out used face masks and other protective equipment because public health officials are investigating whether it will be possible to disinfect and reuse them, Canada's public health chief said Sunday. In her daily briefing, Dr. Theresa Tam also said chief medical officers are working on recommendations to the general public for the best uses of homemade face masks. Tam said \"every stop is being pulled out\" to keep front-line health workers safe in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. In Ontario alone, nearly 275 front-line health workers have tested positive for COVID-19. In Italy, one of the worst-hit countries by the coronavirus, almost one-tenth of the people with COVID-19 are health-care workers. While Canada continues to try and secure new shipments of face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) both from domestic and international manufacturers, Tam said trying to find a way to reuse the masks and equipment the country is also important. \"I think it is one of the most important and I think worthwhile lines of pursuit for PPE, right now,\ " she said. WATCH |  Canada reviewing evidence about use of masks: Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief medical officer of health, says isolation is most important, but wearing non-medical masks to protect others is okay. 2:28 Tam said part of the solution is science, to figure out how decontamination can happen. She also said there are \"multiple entities\" in the country that could do the decontamination work once the science is clear. But for now, she said keeping the used equipment somewhere safe is a necessity. \"Also then signalling to provinces and territories that certain things shouldn't be thrown away, right now, so that we can actually implement this should we find the actual people who can do this,\ " she said. Trudeau 'confident' amid masks row Trudeau also said he is confident Canada will succeed in convincing the United States not to ban exports of protective equipment to Canada. \"I am confident we are going to be able to solve this,\ " Trudeau said. Canada is focusing its efforts on proving to the Americans how much Canada provides to its medical system, including doctors and nurses who cross the border to work in U.S. hospitals in border cities like Detroit. Canada also exports raw materials used in the production of face masks to the United States. WATCH | Trudeau says Ottawa working with Trump administration on supplies: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government is working with the American administration amid calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to keep medical supplies in the United States. 1:15 U.S. President Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era U.S. law that provides the power to redirect U.S. manufacturing capacity in times of national crisis, to compel American producers of PPEs and ventilators to ramp up their production and prioritize orders for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. 3M, one of the country's largest producers of the medical-grade face masks known as N95 respirators, said in a statement Friday it had been told by the White House to stop exporting the equipment to markets in Canada and Latin America — a charge the White House has denied.   INTERACTIVE | How Canada compares with other countries at flattening the curve How will the global coronavirus pandemic end?   Late Friday, the White House issued a statement that suggested the purpose of its order was to target what it called \"wartime profiteers\" —\"unscrupulous brokers, distributors and other intermediaries operating in secondary markets.\" Such parties could include \"some well-established PPE distributors with the ability to unscrupulously divert PPE inventories from domestic customers, such as hospitals and state governments, to foreign purchasers willing to pay significant premiums.\" \"Nothing in this order,\ " the statement concludes, \"will interfere with the ability of PPE manufacturers to export when doing so is consistent with United States policy and in the national interest of the United States.\" WATCH | Canadian politicians slam Trump's 'inhumane' efforts to halt mask exports: Provincial and municipal leaders are criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for attempting to halt exports of N95 masks to Canada. 4:52 Media reports suggest Trump and trade adviser Peter Navarro singled out 3M after a Fox News report accused the Minnesota-based company's American distributors of selling its masks to \"foreign buyers\" that were outbidding U.S. customers. Trudeau said he wasn't going to answer hypothetical questions about retaliating if the U.S. does prevent shipments to Canada, but said Canada will do whatever it takes to protect Canadians. In a media briefing at the White House on Sunday evening, Trump spoke about distributing masks and ventilators throughout the U.S. He did not make any specific mention of mask shipments to Canada or other countries.   When it came to ventilators, however, the president said that several American companies were making them and that the U.S. would be able to help other countries \"after we take care of our needs.\"  Monday is 1st day to apply for emergency benefit On Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that Monday will be the first day people who are out of work because of COVID-19 can go online to apply for the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB).

New York continues to be the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak, as overall deaths in the state climbed to nearly 4,200. However, there was a slight dip in the number of new deaths, as well as ICU admissions, over the last 24 hours, offering a glimmer of hope that the spread might be slowing. New York State Gov.

  The Food, Fish & Allied Workers union is calling for the crab fishery to be postponed until at least May 11, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFAW's crab committee chairs met Sunday and voted to delay the fishery opening again. President Keith Sullivan said the recommendation will be sent to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which holds the authority to open or delay the fishery. \"We have to be able to ensure that we have a safe fishery for everyone involved,\" said Sullivan.   \"Harvesters were responsible enough to delay or recommend delaying, and this shows that safety is the No. 1  priority.\ " Still, Sullivan said harvesters aren't ready to call off the 2020 crab fishing season, which employs thousands and is worth more than $300 million, including export value and spinoffs. FFAW-Unifor president Keith Sullivan says the recommendation to delay the fishery again will be passed on to DFO. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC) \"It's a very valuable fishery and certainly it's not one that people would want to see go by the wayside,\ " he said  \"But again, the main thing, and I can't stress that enough, that I've continually heard from members [is] that we've got to ensure that we can do things safely.\ " Sullivan said they're also calling for a one-month extension to the fishing season. Sullivan said the decision will be re-evaluated and they will give harvesters at least 10 days' notice prior to the fishery opening. The committee also voted unanimously to recommend vessels from out of the province and country be prohibited from landing in the province until fish harvesters deem it safe. Safety protocols released Meanwhile, the Fish Harvesting Safety Association has released 12 control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on fishing vessels, if fisheries open later this spring. The COVID-19 Safe Work Practices include guidelines that recommend what vessel owner/operators should do if a crew member gets sick while at sea. Can you fish in a pandemic? Seafood industry facing hard COVID-19 questions The association said fish harvesters work in a risky environment; they work together closely, share food, sleeping accommodations and washrooms. They also said many fish harvesters are older, which could put them at risk of complications if they get infected with COVID-19.   \"Once you get on a fishing vessel, to keep that distance is extremely difficult and impossible at times,\" said Sullivan. Vessel owners and operators have a responsibility to keep fish harvesters safe, the NL-FHSA said, and advised them to apply the guidelines that they can to provide a safe workplace. However, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans said earlier this month that commercial fisheries will not open before May 1. The COVID-19 Safe Work Practices have 12 control measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. They have guidelines for vessel owner/operators to follow if a crew member gets sick. (Terry Roberts/CBC) To limit the spread of COVID-19, the measures say vessel owners, operators or skippers should conduct a safety briefing with crew and go over safe work practices two weeks before a trip. Meanwhile, the crew must practise all public health precautions, like self-isolation, handwashing and physical distancing and monitor their temperature. Prior to departure, crew should be screened using a COVID-19 questionnaire. The safety protocols also state only crew and service personnel should board a fishing vessel. Service personnel, such as fuel suppliers or mechanics, should also be screened with a COVID-19 questionnaire and be escorted on the vessel. The practices also suggest creating a restricted area around each vessel in the harbour to allow safe access for crew loading and unloading gear, food and supplies. The protocols recommend wearing non-medical masks or face coverings in public areas to limit the spread of the virus. They also encourage good personal hygiene, enhanced vessel cleaning during and between trips and limiting shared food handling.   For sleeping accommodations, they said each crew member should have their own bunk with a curtain. They recommend having two metres between each bunk. Brenda Greenslade is the executive director of N.L.'s Fish Harvester Safety Association. (Jane Adey/CBC) However, in a letter attached to the protocols, the association's executive director, Brenda Greenslade, and board chair, David Decker, acknowledge it would be difficult to contain transmission of the virus if a crew member got sick. If a crew member does get sick, they must notify the skipper, call 811, isolate in their sleeping quarters and wear a mask. All shared areas must be cleaned and disinfected and the sick crew member must be brought to shore. Once on shore, a sick crew member must immediately go home and self-isolate, and so should other crew members. Fish harvesters who get sick at work must report it under workers' compensation legislation.   The NL-FHSA said the practices were developed using the most up-to-date public health information and were reviewed by Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald. Sullivan said the fish harvesters also had input into the practices. \"This is a document that will continue to be upgraded with the best practices and new information as it comes along,\" said Sullivan.

  As COVID-19 spreads in Canada, the advice from medical professionals on how to stay safe has evolved.   At first, Canadians were told to wash their hands and avoid large groups. Within weeks, they were locked down in states of emergency and told to keep their distance from anyone not in the same household.   The federal message about masks has also changed. They're now considered reasonable in public settings such as public transit and grocery stores, where physical distancing can be hard to maintain. But health officials urge people to wear non-medical masks, such as bandanas, scarves and home-made masks, and to  save the medical supply of surgical masks and N95 masks for health-care workers. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now. Here are your top questions answered by chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell.   4:39 In New Brunswick, the advice has shifted too.   The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, initially said that only health-care workers needed to wear masks. Now she is now matching federal advice and suggests masks may be a handy tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19. N95 masks should be used by healthcare workers only. They come in different sizes to make sure the barrier is tight.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) \"We are suggesting that if you are going to wear a face covering that it be the homemade kind,\ " Russell said. The masks aren't for your protection, explained Russell, but for the protection of others, and to make sure your droplets aren't getting on other people. \"This does not replace hand hygiene and it doesn't replace social distancing,\ " she said. Mask-wearing should not replace hand-washing, says Russell. You should also wash your hands before donning your home-made mask and after removing it. (Mike Heenan/CBC) Russell said mask-wearing can help combat community spread of COVID-19. \"We do understand that there is a risk of transmission in those settings,\ " she said. \"We don't believe that it's the driving force of the transmission, but we know we can play a part and this is just one of those precautionary pieces of advice that we're giving people.\" \"Arming people with knowledge, arming people with information so they can take good proper steps to protect themselves and others … is really important.\ " When should you wear a mask?   Russell suggests wearing a mask in public, especially in places where you can't properly maintain two metres of distance between yourself and others.   \"Running errands, grocery shopping,\" she said.   If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate, call 811 or your doctor, and generally refrain from going out in public. But if you have a slight cough, or seasonal allergies, a mask might help protect the spread of any germs or droplets.   \"If you're wearing a facial covering it means that if you do cough, not only do you have the protection of your elbow but it's going to be trapped in the fabric somewhat,\ " she said. What about at work? As to whether you can and should wear a face covering at work, Russel said \"that would be something that you'd have to work out with with your employer.\ "  If you can't maintain two metres of distance while at work, a face-mask might be a good tool to use. But, Russell added, employers should also ensure social distancing i the workplace is happening, too. What's the difference between medical and home-made masks?   N95 masks and surgical masks are used by health-care workers who are on the front lines in hospitals around the world.   N95 masks come in different sizes so as to provide the best barrier against germs. They sometimes come with a filter on the front, and are purpose-built to solely protect the user from small particles. If you have a supply of surgical masks like these, Russell says there's nothing stopping you from using them, but she hopes people will consider donating them to the province.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) Surgical masks are also used in lower-risk health-care settings. They are typically made with three layers of fabric to filter any germs or larger respiratory particles, and they are disposable. N95 masks are in high demand around the world, said Russell, so it's important to leave them for healthcare workers.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) These are not the masks the public should be buying or wearing though, said Russell. N95 masks are in high demand, and stockpiles in hospitals around the world are getting low, which is why it's so important to save these masks for nurses and doctors.   Russell said even if you have a pre-existing medical condition, don't buy a medical mask. Distancing, isolation, and hand-washing measures are the best way to keep yourself safe.   \"People who are wearing the homemade facial coverings, they are doing their part in terms of protecting those people who are at higher risk,\" she said. Where can you get one?   Russell said non-medical masks can be made at home, and she pointed to resources from the Centers for Disease Control. Some people have even shared mask-making patterns on Pinterest, said Russell. \"Whatever pattern you choose, however you decide to make it, whether it's a sewn one or one that's not sewn, there have to be no gaps around your face. So when it is fitted onto your face there can't be any big gaps,\ " she said. Some sewers suggest using quilting fabric or fabric in a double-layer to make the masks, but you can even use an old T-shirt, according to the CDC. Masks made at home should be large enough to cover your mouth and nose, and should have no gaps on the sides.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) The mask should also be comfortable, said Russell, otherwise you won't want to wear it. It should also be large enough to cover both your nose and mouth.   If you currently have a stock of surgical masks, Russell said there's nothing stopping you from using them, but would rather see people donate them to the province's stockpile.   More information around how exactly to donate to that stockpile will be coming out very soon, said Russell.    How do you use it?   The mask should fit comfortably on your face and around your ears and should have no visible gaps. \"Wash your hands when you put it on, and wash your hands when you take it off,\ " said Russell. Masks like this one can be worn in public places where maintaining two metres of distance is difficult, like on public transit or in a grocery store.   (Mike Heenan/CBC) It's also important to wash the mask every day, or else germs will just stay on the fabric.   \"I would not want people to just wear these facial coverings without making sure that they're doing proper hand hygiene and actually washing the material that the mask is made of,\" she said. As for how to clean the masks, hot, soapy water should do the trick, but other cleaning advice is available online.   \"If you washed it in hot soapy water at a good high temperature that would suffice,\ " Russell said. \"But there could be other cleaning advice as well that you would find resources for.\ "

  Some local politicians are considering large fines for people caught discarding used gloves and masks in public, with several sightings of the disposable items littering streets around Metro Vancouver. Medical professionals say it is thoughtless and irresponsible behaviour, as the items present a real danger of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.   \"It's not only littering it's also selfish,\" said Vancouver Coun.  Pete Fry. \"If they're contaminated enough that you don't want to put them in personal garbage, which obviously people aren't doing, then you're really sort of passing the problem onto someone else.\" B.C.'s top doctor stops short of recommending widespread mask use, but says they can protect others Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart echoed Fry's words in a Facebook video. \"If you think something is contaminated, leaving it for others is about the most selfish thing you could do,\" he said, adding that the city is considering hefty fines.   The City of Vancouver said it may do the same if the situation gets worse. Neither municipality determined how much any potential fine would be. Doctors say discarded masks and gloves can contain the coronavirus if the wearer has COVID-19 or has touched a surface carrying the virus. \"Multiple particles of the virus [could be] on there and can be for days, and the poor soul who has to dispose of garbage will be exposed,\" said Dr. Mayam Zeineddin, a doctor in Vancouver. Doctors say littered masks and gloves can present a danger if the wearer has COVID-19 or has touched a surface carrying the virus. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Doctors say masks should be taken off from the back first, while gloves should be removed from the inside out before they are thrown safely in the garbage. Users should then thoroughly wash their hands. If you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at impact@cbc.ca.   
  As much of Newfoundland and Labrador shuts down out of caution, there are still no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the province as of late Friday afternoon. \"We are serious about containment of this virus,\ " Janice Fitzgerald, chief medical officer of health, told reporters late Friday afternoon, after a rash of cancellation and closure announcements throughout the day. The province has tested 62 people so far, with 46 of those confirmed negative. It continues to recommend that people refrain from travelling outside the province, in accordance with national advisories. Eastern Health says it has established an emergency operations centre for COVID-19 and an assessment clinic is being set up. A location has still to be determined. That clinic will be up and running by next week, according to an internal memo distributed by the regional health authority.  An algorithm has been developed to screen for potential cases of COVID-19, according to the email. Fitzgerald also provided the number of ventilators at the disposal of health authorities, saying there are 156 of the machines — which have proved vital for keeping severely ill patients alive — spread across the province. Rash of closures Municipalities also took drastic measures Friday to contain the spread of the virus in the likely case it arrives here.   All recreational facilities in St. John's, Mount Pearl, Paradise and Conception Bay South will close by Friday night. The municipal after-school centres, for St. John's and Paradise, will remain open. The N.L. government is closing provincially owned pools and training centres starting Saturday. Those include pools in Gander, Corner Brook and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Mile One stadium will also close its doors starting Saturday. Premier Dwight Ball hammered home the province's recommendation of cancelling any gathering over 250 people. \"This is for real. It's evolving,\ " Ball said Friday afternoon.  \"This is a very serious situation.\" Dr. Janice Fitzgerald says cancellations and closures across the province so far are appropriate and will slow the spread if the virus arrives here. (Malone Mullin/CBC) \"One of the key concerns now is transmission, and the idea is to keep down social interactions and keep larger groups from congregating,\" St. John's Mayor Danny Breen told reporters at a news conference late Friday afternoon. Public meetings at St. John's city hall and its facilities are cancelled. City council will continue to meet, but its weekly public meeting will be closed to the public. The meeting will be broadcast on the city's website. Non-essential gatherings of events of 250 people or more should be cancelled or postponed, the province said. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said Friday afternoon that schools will remain open, but is limiting large gatherings and has begun cancelling all international trips. It has suspended the community use of schools Those precautions are appropriate, Fitzgerald said — not overreactions. \"This virus is a virus that is new ...  We're still learning about it,\" she cautioned. \"These types of precautions have been found to be helpful in other places. And at this point I think we have to take every precaution we can.\ " Panic-buying toilet paper and canned food, however, isn't necessary to prepare, according to Fitzgerald.  \"Nobody needs to run out and buy mounds of things at this point,\ " she said, advising that two weeks' worth of essential medications and a little extra food would suffice. Sports seasons iced Meanwhile, thousands of children across the province will be disappointed to learn the remainder of their minor hockey season has been put on hold  — and the same goes for junior and senior hockey, after the province's governing body, Hockey NL, pulled the plug on Thursday night. Hockey NL has cancelled all sanctioned events for the time being. (CBC) This is a busy time of year for Hockey NL, with the St. John's Junior Hockey League and East Coast Senior Hockey League playoffs in full swing. The West Coast Senior Hockey League was set to start its final series on Friday. The St. John's Edge and Newfoundland Growlers will also be sidelined for the foreseeable future, as both the National Basketball League of Canada and ECHL have postponed their seasons. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCNL?ref_src =twsrc%5Etfw\">@CBCNL</a> Marble Mountain has been closed. General sense of disappointment amount the people slowly filing out to the parking lot. <a href=\"https://t.co/3qGHUFz4Vj\">pic.twitter.com/3qGHUFz4Vj</a>&mdash;@IvanJWhite Marble Mountain will also close for the rest of the season.   NLESD, MUN postpone large events On Friday morning, the English school board suspended all extracurricular activities between schools. That includes all regional and provincial sports tournaments, heritage and science fairs, drama festivals, \"or any activity that sees multiple school populations gathered for showcase events or competition,\" according to a letter sent to parents. The letter said it was an \"unfortunate measure but a prudent step\" to prevent the potential spread of the virus. Memorial University, meanwhile, is cancelling or postponing all non-essential gatherings of 25 or more people. Classes, labs and academic activities are continuing. Hockey Canada halts all sanctioned activities 'until further notice' due to virus concernStill no confirmed COVID-19 cases in N.L. The school said no decisions have been made about convocation ceremonies in May. The events draw thousands of people to campus each year. The university is waiving the need for sick notes for employees experiencing respiratory illness less than 14 days. One private school outside the district's purview is taking things a step further. St. Bonaventure's College in St. John's is telling any students who have left the province since Feb. 28 to stay home for 14 days — as well as those whose family members have done so, even if the student did not.   A note sent to parents says students will be given material by their teachers while they work from home during the isolation period. All theatre events at Arts and Culture Centres across the province have been cancelled until further notice. Rehearsal rooms, smaller classes and art groups with people of 25 or less will still be permitted. Liberal leadership hopeful Andrew Furey, who is a orthopedic surgeon, said he is halting in-person campaigning, saying it's not responsible to shake hands and congregate when health officials are telling people to avoid large gatherings. CBC News has asked John Abbott, who is also seeking the Liberal leader role, about his campaign plans.   The province's Department of Justice says kits with protective glasses, gloves and masks are in every unit within correctional facilities.   \"An area of quarantine is being prepared at each facility should an inmate present with symptoms of COVID-19,\" reads a statement to CBC News.   Caution for St. Patrick's Day Revellers dance at Shamrock City Pub in St. John's on St. Patrick's Day 2019. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC) With St. Patrick's Day right around the corner, an associate professor of public health at Memorial University, is urging people to exercise caution while celebrating the holiday. That includes bar owners on George Street — one of the busiest stretches outside Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. \"Don't try to pack as many people into your club or bar as you normally would,\ " Donovan advised.  \"Try to allow for that distance between people.\" Cathy Donovan is an associate professor at Memorial University's school of medicine. (Paula Gale/CBC) Donovan had high praise for health-care workers and said people do need to be ready to spend two weeks in isolation, and parents should have plans if schools and daycares close. \"We have the time to plan. We have that luxury right now. So I think that's important to do.\" Cruise ship restrictions At least part of the busy cruise ship season for St. John's, and other ports in Canada, will be impacted — cruise ships with more than 500 passengers will not be allowed to dock in Canadian ports from April 2 to July 1, according to Marc Garneau, the federal transportation minister. St. John's had three ships set to dock within that time, but only one of them is now permitted to dock, as per the new rules. However, there are at least two dozen other cruise ships scheduled to dock in St. John's for the rest of July to October.   St. John's was hammered by a blizzard in January, which caused businesses to close for a week. They're staring down the barrel of another disruption now, as concerns of COVID-19 rise. (Submitted by Alick Tsui) With events being cancelled all over the place, the St. John's Board of Trade fears it's only a matter of time until business comes to a screeching halt in the Avalon region for the second time this winter, following the blizzard in January. \"It's extremely concerning, and that's why our attention right now is with our small business community,\ " said Rhonda Tulk-Lane, acting CEO of the St. John's Board of Trade. Those travelling through the St. John's International Airport will see increased signage on hand-washing and practicing good hygiene, according to the airport authority, which also said it was \"working with contracted cleaners\" to ramp up sanitization of high-traffic areas.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through droplets that we spew as we breathe, talk, cough and sneeze — so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye.   That's why questions remain about the virus's transmission and what precautions need to be taken to curb its spread as governments begin to lift restrictions. Will it help if everyone wears a mask? Is keeping everyone two metres apart far enough? Some researchers aim to learn more about transmission by trying to make invisible sneezes, coughs and breaths more visible. Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal. How do scientists think COVID-19 is transmitted? According to the World Health Organization, the disease spreads primarily through tiny droplets expelled when a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 sneezes, coughs, exhales or spits while talking. They can infect another person who:   Comes into contact with those droplets through their eyes, nose or mouth (droplet transmission).    Touches objects or surfaces on which droplets have landed and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth (contact transmission).    The WHO says it's important to stay \"more than one metre away\" from a person who is sick. But the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends staying a distance of at least two metres or two arms' lengths away, not just from people who are sick but from all people you don't live with. Why is 2 metres the recommended distance for preventing transmission? Scientists in the 19th century showed respiratory droplets from a person's nose and mouth can carry micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Then, in 1934, W.F. Wells at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that large droplets (bigger than 0.1 millimetre) tended to fall and settle on the ground within a distance of two metres, while smaller droplets evaporated and the virus particles left behind could remain suspended in the air for a long time.   Wells proposed that could explain how diseases are transmitted. Since then, respiratory diseases have been divided into those transmitted via droplets (usually from close contact) and those that are airborne and can spread over longer distances, such as measles or tuberculosis.   INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday Such tiny particles are presumably pushed around by air currents, but can't move easily due to air resistance. So their actual movements haven't been well modelled or measured, said Lydia Bourouiba, professor and director of the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   \"And that's why the notion of airborne [transmission] is very murky,\" said Bourouiba, who is Canadian. Why don't experts think the virus is airborne? A pair of recent studies raised the notion of airborne transmission, but Mark Loeb, a professor at Hamilton's McMaster University who specializes in infectious disease research, cautions against putting too much stock in them.   Researchers found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in washrooms and some high-traffic areas in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and in Nebraska, and suggested it got into those areas through the air, though there was no evidence the particles were still infectious.   Loeb said that's just a \"signal\" that part of the virus was there.   \"Does it mean that COVID-19 is spreading from person to person through aerosols? I would say definitively not,\ " Loeb said.   Government guidelines in Canada recommend that people stay at least two metres away from others as part of physical distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. (Gary Moore/CBC) If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted. \"The reason we know that is because all around the world we have hundreds of health-care workers who are taking care of patients wearing regular masks,\ " she said. \"If this were airborne —  if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles  —  all those health-care workers would be getting sick.\ " The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious. Infection control guidelines do recommend extra personal protective equipment (including N-95 respirators) to protect against airborne transmission for health-care workers performing procedures that generate high concentrations of aerosolized particles, such as intubations, on COVID-19 patients, McGeer said.    Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests But even in that scenario, the degree to which those particles are infectious hasn't been yet proven — and it a very different scenario than what people are facing in the community.   \"You and I don't have to worry walking down the street that we're going to be breathing the air of somebody who walked down the street five minutes ahead of us who had COVID-19 and didn't know it,\ " said McGeer, \"That we can be confident about.\ " Is there evidence the virus could be spread farther than 2 metres? Some studies, including Bourouiba's, show that droplets from coughs and sneezes can, in fact, travel much farther than expected. Bourouiba's high-speed imaging measurements and modelling show smaller respiratory droplets don't behave like individual droplets but  are in a turbulent gas cloud trapping them and carrying them forward within it. The moist environment reduces evaporation, allowing droplets of many sizes to survive much longer and travel much farther than two metres — up to seven or eight metres, in the case of a sneeze.   WATCH | Close-up view of the droplets released by a person sneezing   (Credit Lydia Bourouiba/MIT/JAMA Networks) She said the research \"is about revealing what you cannot see with the naked eye.\" A more recent Canadian study used a \"cough chamber\" to show that if someone coughs without covering their mouth, droplets from the cough are still travelling at a speed of about one kilometre per hour when they hit the two-metre edge of the chamber. Within the chamber, droplets remained suspended for up to three minutes.   WATCH | The speed and distance travelled by droplets from a cough   Dr. Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who co-authored the study, said it \"gives you a sense of what the possibilities are,\ " but noted that the researchers, who were studying flu patients, detected very little virus in the droplets. What does that say about the 2-metre guideline? Bourouiba says her research points to the potential for exposure beyond two metres from someone who is coughing and sneezing. As she wrote in the journal JAMA Insights in March, that means it's \"vitally important\" for health care workers to wear high-grade personal protective equipment in the form of respirators even if they're farther than two metres away from infected patients.    However, she does think two metres can be far enough for healthy people in the general public in most environments, since breathing and talking don't propel droplets and surrounding cloud too far. Mubareka stands by the two-metre guideline despite the findings of her cough chamber study. Despite dramatic images of respiratory droplets being propelled from someone's nose and mouth, it's not yet clear how many of them contain virus and how many are infectious. Second OpinionShould masks be mandatory in public to stop the spread of COVID-19? \"And that's really the key variable — that's what really determines your risk,\ " she said. \"Those are the kinds of things we haven't been able to measure.\ " That may change, she added, with the recent invention of particle samplers designed specifically for viruses. Loeb of McMaster, notes that a cough chamber and similar laboratory setups are highly artificial settings and controlled environments. \"They're basically saying what's theoretically possible,\" he said. \"I think those are provocative and those are hypothesis- generating, but then they need to be tested in the field.\" Loeb is running such a field test himself — a randomized controlled trial of the use of medical versus N95 masks among health care workers to see if there is a difference in the transmission of COVID-19. But are coughing and sneezing all we need to worry about? That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.   Even though researchers aren't sure exactly how people without symptoms transmit the disease, the new evidence has prompted both U.S. and Canadian officials to suggest apparently healthy people wear masks in public to protect others —  \"because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau famously explained. \"People generate particles when they're talking, singing, breathing —  so you don't have to necessarily be coughing,\ " Mubareka said. \"It's just that maybe the dispersion is a little bit more limited.\"   WATCH | The droplets produced when someone speaks with, and without, a mask This video, from a study published in April 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, uses laser light scattering to show droplets produced when someone speaks. 0:42   A recent brief video and report by U.S. National Institutes of Health researchers used lasers to show that droplets projected less than 10 centimetres when someone says the phrase \"Stay healthy.\ " It found the louder someone spoke, the more droplets were emitted. But they were dramatically reduced if a damp washcloth  — a stand-in for a mask — was placed over the speaker's mouth. So what about using masks to curb the spread of COVID-19? Studies have already provided evidence that the rate at which sick people shed the virus into their surroundings is reduced when they wear a mask.   Other studies, such as a 2009 paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, use imaging to show how wearing a mask while coughing reduces the jet of air that's normally directed forward and down. A surgical mask \"effectively blocks the forward momentum of the cough jet and its aerosol content,\" the study found. Some does leak out the sides, top and bottom, but without much momentum. A 2009 study by researchers in the U.S. and Singapore uses schlieren imaging to show airflow from a person's mouth a) without a mask b) with a medical mask and c) with an N95 mask. (Gary S. Settles/Penn State University/Journal of the Royal Society Interface) The World Health Organization recommends that people wear masks if they are coughing and sneezing or if they are caring for someone who is sick. It notes that studies haven't been conducted yet on whether or not transmission is reduced when healthy people wear masks in public, but it encourages countries to look into that.   Many governments haven't waited. Los Angeles, Italy and Austria are among the places that have begun requiring customers to wear masks while shopping.    To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by clicking here. 
  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.   WATCH |  Dr. Samir Gupta explains what you should consider before putting on a mask against COVID-19: Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Which mask is recommended for health-care workers? For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask? Your COVID-19 questions answeredMask shortage is 'imminent': Health workers associations urge province to take more action There also is limited evidence that healthy people wearing masks reduces the community spread of diseases, like COVID-19, as public health officials have been saying, but some acknowledge that's partly because studies haven't been done. A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places. CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisisYour guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada The researchers also said that for cultural reasons, masks are considered a hygienic practice even for healthy people in Asia, while in North America it's considered something only sick people do. Children wear masks at the Hong Kong West Kowloon High Speed Train Station, in Hong Kong on Jan. 23. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking public transit or staying in crowded places. (Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made. A lone jogger, wearing a protective face mask, runs with her dog in the Tuileries Garden in Paris on Monday. Medical experts say there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are avoiding contact with other people as they're supposed to be. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03
  Canada's chief public health officer and health minister say medical-grade masks need to be reserved for the use of front-line health workers — but it can't hurt for others to wear homemade masks or fabric face coverings , provided they do so properly. \"It's absolutely critical that if people are wearing masks outside — and it certainly is their prerogative to do that, by the way — that we are not taking away masks that are surgical or are specialized that are extremely necessary on the front line, and that we are not using masks in a way ... that is not appropriate,\ " Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday. Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said the supply of medical-grade masks must be preserved for health system workers and those looking after patients infected with COVID-19. \"The effectiveness of the use of non-medical masks hasn't really been well demonstrated,\" said Tam. \"But I think that there may not be any harm in wearing it, if one uses it properly — it's not gaping , it's really well fitted and you practice hygienic measures.\ " 1/7 There is a lot of discussion on use of face masks. It can help to break the discussion into two main considerations regarding the TYPE of mask &amp; the conditions for safe USE of masks in different circumstances/settings. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag /COVID19?src= hash&amp;ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>&mdash;@CPHO_Canada Until recently, the federal government was saying that masks are unnecessary for those not exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and that non-medical masks, or poorly-fitted medical masks, won't filter out the small airborne particles carrying the virus. Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam say it's up to Canadians themselves to decide whether to wear homemade masks — but the science on their effectiveness is uncertain and the best protection against COVID-19 is still physical distancing.    4:28 But Tam said that the science on the use of masks and other medical responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak is changing. \"From a public health perspective, we need to take in evolution in information in science,\ " she said. \"We've been doing that, and these are the kinds of things that we discuss as a community of practices in terms of the public health and the chief medical officers.\" Ottawa 'likely did not have enough' protective gear stockpiled: HajduINTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 57,000+ cases in Canada on SundayCanadian government shopping for high-demand N95 masks on the international market Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would continue to take his advice from health officials but that, in his opinion, wearing a mask could be safer than not wearing one. \"Are you safer with a mask? Absolutely, you're safer.  I can't stand up here and say you would be safer without a mask, so my opinion, you'd be safer with a mask,\ " he said Wednesday. \"But again, I'm going to stick with the advice of the chief medical officer of health and the medical professionals ... \ " Masks have been used extensively in public in countries like China, Japan and South Korea, but the practice is not widespread outside of the region. That changed this week when Austria mandated that all people entering supermarkets or shops must wear masks. Other countries, such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina, have implemented similar measures. The argument against wearing masks in public were outlined by Hajdu and Tam on Wednesday. They insisted that masks that are not properly fitted will let contaminated particles pass. They also fear that masks could give people a false sense of security, leading them to let important hygiene measures slide. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 \"We also know what actually does work already, which is physical distancing,\" said Tam. \"Those droplets fall a certain distance. That's why we've been recommending the two metre distance that actually works. Frequent hand washing absolutely works, not touching your face are absolutely proven measures and everyone should practise those regardless of what else you are adding to those layers of protection.\" Tam and Hajdu also warned that masks have to be removed so that any contagious particles lodged in them don't find their way into someone's mouth or nose. The upside to wearing masks Tam said that there are clear positives to the use of non-medical, cloth or homemade masks.   \"On the one hand, it might potentially reduce you from touching your nose or your mouth, if you've covered up those parts,\" she said. \"But you have to be really careful then that you are not putting your finger in you eye when you're pulling your mask on and off, that you're [not] touching your face in other ways.\ " Masks are probably most useful, Tam said, as a way to catch the cough of someone wearing one, so that potentially infected droplets are not being spread around to other people or surfaces. Tam said that people with COVID-19 who have been asked to isolate but need to go to essential appointments could wear masks to prevent themselves from spreading the virus. And anyone exhibiting symptoms, even mild ones, could wear a mask for the same reasons. N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC)

(Maggie MacPherson/CBC) Canadian officials say isolation orders will be in place 'for a long time' Canadian officials warned that emergency and public health measures will likely be in place for some time to come — and with case numbers rising, several provinces have made moves to extend orders aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix on Tuesday told people in his province there is \"zero chance — none\ " that orders meant to tackle COVID-19 would be varied by the end of this month. \"I think we're in this for a long time,\ " he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to put a specific timeline on how long strict measures could last, saying they would be in place for a number of weeks — and perhaps months. Trudeau again reiterated a call on Canadians to respect public health rules and practise physical distancing, saying the behaviour of Canadians has a direct impact on how the health crisis will unfold. Today, Toronto provided details about a 12-week plan to try to clamp down on the virus's spread, after Mayor John Tory said COVID-19 \"numbers are presently heading in the wrong direction\" in Canada's largest city. Quebec, meanwhile, tightened up its rules around non-essential travel both within the province as well as into the western part of the province, with exclusions for essential workers. Read more about what's happening across Canada   Air pollution eases in 4 Canadian cities as pandemic measures keep people home Public health measures shutting down workplaces and schools to fight the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a noticeable reduction in air pollution in multiple Canadian cities known for their traffic congestion, according to satellite images shared with CBC News. Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver have seen drops in vehicle traffic over the last few days as physical distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have kept Canadians closer to home. Images from Descartes Labs of the major cities and surrounding areas show their average levels of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) — a pollutant created by the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline — has plummeted compared to a year ago. Nitrogen dioxide should not be confused with greenhouse gases — but because it and carbon dioxide are both produced when fossil fuels are burned, there is a relationship between levels of NO2 and carbon dioxide emissions. Read more about the reduction in air pollution The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise around the world — and here at home. That has many wondering whether public health officials should revisit their policies on people wearing face masks. But as we learn, there are many questions with not so many definitive answers. Where is the science on wearing masks? Where should you wear a mask? How should you wear it? What about supply? Jayme Poisson tries to tackle some of these questions with Dr. Isaac Bogoch, on tonight’s Front Burner. 13:04 Canadian suppliers won't have N95 masks ready for months, forcing the government to look abroad With no domestic production of crucial N95 masks for health-care workers on the COVID-19 front lines, Canada's federal government is bulk-buying tens of millions of them on the international market to meet short-term demand. The Trudeau government's announcement yesterday that it will spend up to $2 billion to procure personal protective equipment — including more than 60 million N95 masks — comes weeks into a global pandemic and raises questions about Canada's emergency preparedness. Only medical masks such as those labelled N95, sometimes called respirators, are designed and fitted to filter out the tiny aerosol particles that carry the novel coronavirus. Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce only some aerosol particles. Earlier today, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam offered some guidance on the use of non-medical masks. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam speaks about how Canadians can safely use homemade masks or scarves, the evolution of thinking around masks and whether they actually help keep people safe. 1:59 Health-care workers around the country say they have been rationing the protective N95 masks while they wait for stocks to be replenished. Because there are currently no domestic manufacturers of N95 masks, pressure put on the global supply by the coronavirus pandemic has left Canada in a precarious position. Read more about the need for N95 masks   (CBC News) ANALYSIS Strategies for safe grocery shopping during a pandemic Public health officials across the country have been consistent in their advice that people stay home as much as possible and therefore try to shop for groceries only once a week or less, and preferably alone. But Canadians still have questions about how to best get groceries during a pandemic. Here are some insights from experts: If debating between shopping online or going in person to the grocery store, a simple message from Toronto's medical officer of health, Eileen de Villa, may help guide you: \"Each time we leave our homes, we increase the risk of virus spread.\ " But in some parts of the country right now, getting a delivery or even a pickup slot for online shopping is nearly impossible without a wait of a week or two. Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases specialist at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, suggests that people who are healthy and able can still go to the grocery store in person. And what should you do once you're at the store? Disinfect the shopping cart handle and do your best to keep two metres between you and other people, even if it means waiting to go down an aisle or to get what you need off the shelf. Wash or disinfect your hands after you pay for and pack up your groceries and before you put them in your car. Once you get home, \"put away the groceries, wash your hands,\ " Chagala says. And when you're preparing your food, he advises to wash your hands afterwards, just as you would normally before you eat. THE SCIENCE Canadian hospitals getting 'creative' to expand COVID-19 care facilities With many experts predicting a surge in COVID-19 cases here in the next couple of weeks, many Canadian hospitals are also looking for \"creative\" solutions as they scramble to prepare. Paul-Émile Cloutier, the CEO of the largest national organization of hospitals in Canada, said hospital administrators are looking at recreation centres, hotels and other facilities that may be vacant right now. As well, some have ordered \"makeshift\" hospitals and quarantine centres to be constructed. \"They do not want to be in the same position as Italy,\" he says. In the U.S., naval hospital ships have been pressed into service in New York and California. There's so far no word of the Canadian government pressing naval ships into COVID-19 service, but there is existing infrastructure in Canada that could be transformed into medical facilities to assist with the expected surge of cases. An off-site solution presents its own unique challenges. \"The rationale for keeping patients on-site is that with COVID-19, patients' conditions can change very quickly,\" said Dr. Ian Preyra, chief of staff of the new pandemic response unit in Burlington, Ont. \"We want them to be close to the hospital so that we can transfer them directly to intensive care if their conditions worsen.\" AND FINALLY... N.S. grocery store staff use mystery gift to buy groceries for seniors Staff members at an Atlantic Superstore in Antigonish, N.S., bought groceries for four seniors in the area after receiving $400 from an anonymous customer as a gift. (Mark Boudreau) Atlantic Superstore staff in Antigonish, N.S., decided to use an anonymous gift that was dropped off by a customer to buy groceries for four seniors who live in the area. A man dropped off 10 sealed envelopes covered with messages such as \"Thank you for working,\ " \"Thank you for all you're doing during COVID-19\" and \"Thank you from the community.\ " Each envelope contained $40 and the man wanted the envelopes to be distributed to the store's staff. Patti Hilton, the store's manager, said the staff decided to use the $400 to buy groceries for four seniors, and that they would be making the deliveries personally. \"Here's the thing, we are still working. We still get a paycheque every week and there are so many people out of work and so many seniors that need help right now that we decided to pay it forward,\ " Hilton said.

We're about to find outMade-in-Canada ventilators, masks, test kits coming soon: Trudeau Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Tuesday that the federal government is \"aggressively buying in bulk from all available suppliers and distributors.\"  The same day, Quebec Premier François Legault said protective equipment for hospitals, including masks, was just days away from running out. Call for domestic production went out 11 days ago The government said Tuesday that it has inked deals with three Canadian companies — Thornhill Medical, Medicom and Spartan Bioscience — to make ventilators, surgical masks, test kits and other items, but the more than 60 million N95 masks it has ordered are all coming from foreign suppliers. Anand said deliveries will start next week. It was just 11 days ago that the federal government put out a call to domestic businesses and manufacturers \"to help deliver critical health supplies.\ "  Normally, local health authorities in each province purchase their own protective gear, but given the global supply shortages in recent weeks, the provincial ministries and now the federal government have had to step in.   Canadian hospitals getting 'creative' to expand COVID-19 care facilitiesCanada Goose making scrubs, patient gowns for hospitals in light of COVID-19 shortages Last Friday, Health Canada told CBC News that the Public Health Agency of Canada was deploying N95 masks and other protective gear from the national emergency strategic stockpile.   Ontario Premier Doug Ford said last week in a radio interview that the province was working with an automotive supply company — Woodbridge — in Mississauga, Ont., on production of N95 masks, because a world-leading supplier, the multi-national corporation 3M, was swamped with international orders. 3 M not manufacturing N95 masks in Canada According to St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M's website, the company is currently producing 100 million N95 masks a month globally. Much of that production is in Aberdeen, S.D. Its subsidiary, 3M Canada, has several manufacturing plants in this country, but according to an online statement, the company does not manufacture N95 masks in any of its Canadian facilities.   CBC News contacted 3M Canada president Penny Wise on Monday to ask whether the company would retool any of its Canadian factories to meet demand in Canada. Wise's office did not answer the question, saying instead that the company had doubled the amount of N95 masks brought into the country during the first three months of 2020. Wise did not say how many masks that is.   N95 masks are designed to filter 95 per cent of airborne particles. (Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters) The federal government announced Tuesday that it \"was in the process of finalizing an agreement\" with the Montreal-based protective equipment manufacturer Medicom to start N95 and surgical mask production in Canada.   \"We need a sustainable, stable supply of these products, and that means making them at home, and we are optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks,\ " Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. Industry Minister Navdeep Bains said at the Tuesday press conference that the ability to produce the masks within Canada remains \"a core objective of ours.\ " Surgical masks only But the proposed Medicom manufacturing site won't be up and running for months. According to the company, neither the location nor the number of facilities that will be producing masks has been decided. It is aiming to start production in early summer.   In the short term, Medicom has a separate agreement with the federal government to supply \"tens of millions\" of surgical masks only. Sask. Health Authority CEO says he knows 'for a fact' staff involved in stealing masks, gloves from hospitalsPoint of View: Patience, please — waiting for cancer surgery during a pandemic Medicom's chief operating officer, Guillaume Laverdure, told CBC News there have been no discussions in the past with governments in Canada about domestic production of protective masks. \"Manufacturing locally is more expensive than importing from China. That's a fact,\ " he said. \"So, in times where provincial hospital budgets are tight, there is a natural tendency to go to the cheapest possible product.\ "  Workers inspect newly made surgical masks at a factory in Hong Kong. (Isaac Lawrence/AFP via Getty Images) Laverdure said the new paradigm is that governments are willing to pay a little more as long as they have access to products locally. Health-care workers have been relying in part on corporate donations of personal protective gear to help bridge the supply gap. The Canadian government has said several companies have donated personal protective and safety equipment and sanitizing supplies, including: Magna, General Motors, Toyota Canada, Ford, Linamar, Shell, Suncor, Alibaba Group and Home Depot Ontario hospital staff told to ration masks as COVID-19 spreadsNurses treating COVID-19 patients say they urgently need protective gear
  The death toll from the coronavirus in China has risen to 56 with 1,975 total cases reported. The figures reported Sunday morning cover the previous 24 hours and mark an increase of 15 deaths and 688 cases. The Chinese government also reported five cases in Hong Kong, two in Macao and three in Taiwan. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia. In Canada, health officials in Ontario on Saturday confirmed its first \"presumptive\" case of coronavirus in Toronto. The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday. A notice from the embassy in Beijing on Sunday said there would be limited capacity to transport U.S. citizens on the flight that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to individuals \"at greater risk from coronavirus.\" President Xi Jinping on Saturday called the spreading illness a grave situation in remarks reported by state broadcaster CCTV. He spoke at a meeting of Communist Party leaders convened on Lunar New Year — the country's biggest holiday whose celebrations have been muted — and underlined the government's urgent, expanding efforts to control the outbreak Travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours, the state-owned English-language China Daily newspaper reported, citing the China Association of Travel Services. Watch: 'Presumptive' case of coronavirus in Toronto Public health officials confirm the first \"presumptive\" case of the coronavirus in Toronto, but say the risk to Ontarians is still low. 2:24 Millions of people travelling during the holiday have fuelled the spread of the outbreak nationwide and overseas after it began in the city of Wuhan in central China. The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China, but fresh cases are popping up. Singapore reported its fourth case on Sunday, a 36-year-old man from Wuhan. The Health Ministry said he did not exhibit any symptoms on his flight. He developed a cough the next day, sought treatment on Jan. 24 and was immediately isolated. South Korea confirmed its third case, according to Yonhap news agency. Cities scramble to contain virus In the heart of the outbreak where 11 million residents are already on lockdown, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday, state media reported. Only authorized vehicles would be permitted, the reports said. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighbourhoods, under the management of resident committees, to help people get around if they need to, China Daily said. In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam said her government will raise its response level to emergency, the highest one, and close primary and secondary schools for two more weeks on top of next week's Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen Feb. 17. People wear masks on a train on the first day of the Lunar New Year in Hong Kong on Saturday. (Dale de la Rey/AFP via Getty Images) Lam said direct flights and trains from Wuhan would be blocked. In a sign of the growing strain on Wuhan's health-care system, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the city planned to build a second makeshift hospital with about 1,000 beds. The city has said another hospital was expected to be completed Feb. 3. CBC ExplainsWhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreak The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal. China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, as well as public transportation within the city, and has steadily expanded a lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million — greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined.   China's biggest holiday, Lunar New Year, unfolded Saturday in the shadow of the virus. Authorities cancelled a host of events, and closed major tourist destinations and movie theatres. Temples locked their doors, Beijing's Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland closed, and people cancelled restaurant reservations ahead of the holiday, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people. Beijing struggles to keep up with a virus  — and a nation on the move \"We originally planned to go back to my wife's hometown and bought train tickets to depart this afternoon,\" said Li Mengbin, who was on a stroll near the closed Forbidden City. \"We ended up cancelling. But I'm still happy to celebrate the new year in Beijing, which I hadn't for several years.\ " Temples and parks were decorated with red streamers, paper lanterns and booths, but some places started dismantling the decor. Demand for gloves, masks People in China wore medical masks to public places like grocery stores, where workers dispensed hand sanitizer to customers. Some parts of the country had checkpoints for temperature readings and made masks mandatory. French automaker PSA Group said it will evacuate its employees from Wuhan, quarantine them and then bring them to France. The Foreign Ministry said it was working on \"eventual options\" to evacuate French citizens from Wuhan \"who want to leave.\ " It didn't elaborate. The National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak, a day after videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.   The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, who arrived in Wuhan late Friday to help treat many patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia, Xinhua reported. Xinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles. The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse but could reflect better monitoring and reporting of the virus. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the U.S. alone. 
  It's not the most difficult thing she's crocheted, but Julie Seaborn says her homemade mask holders are helping a lot of front-line workers. (Submitted by Julie Seaborn) A Corner Brook crafter has found a way to help front-line health-care workers during COVID-19 — she's crocheting mask holders and giving them out for free. Julie Seaborn says she started making them for some friends who work in health care. A few weeks in, she's made close to 400. \"I can't help [fight the pandemic] in any other way with medical care,\ " she said. \"So it's something I can do to make them a little more comfortable.\ "  Crocheted from cotton yarn, each strip is about four inches long with a button on either end. The holder is worn on the back of the head, with the mask's elastic ear loops hooked around the buttons to keep them from cutting into the back of the ears. Nurse Erin Noseworthy wears one of Seaborn's mask holders. (Submitted by Julie Seaborn) A crocheter for years, Seaborn said the mask holders are incredibly easy to make and she's been whipping through them quickly.   \"Something that takes me just five minutes to make apparently is helping people greatly,\ " she said. A huge help Though they're only small strips of  yarn, the mask holders have been a big help to health-care workers. Dr. Amy Pieroway, chief of family medicine for the Western Regional Health Authority, says worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment, have prompted health-care workers to save their masks when possible. When she works in a high-risk area, she changes her mask from patient to patient but otherwise she might wear the same one for hours. \"It's when you have to wear [a mask] for an extended period of time that people find it super-irritating,\" Pieroway said. \"These gadgets that Julie's making actually help save the back of your ears.\" A family assembly line Seaborn gets more requests for her mask holders every day. In order to keep up with the demand she's made her homemade assembly line more efficient — by recruiting the rest of her family. Her children pick out and attach the buttons while husband Glen weaves in the ends to finish each holder. Though she's already made nearly 400 mask holders, Seaborn says she gets new requests for them every day.   (Submitted by Julie Seaborn) What started as a way to help out a few friends has turned into a family effort to help others during the pandemic. \"It's something that we've been really keen to teach our kids,\ " Seaborn said. \"No matter what's happening , there's always a way to help, whether it's small or big. You can do your best to help your community.\ " Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador
  Hundreds of Nova Scotia health-care workers are doing double duty coaching their co-workers in the proper use of personal protective equipment. It's all part of the province's plan to conserve masks, gloves, gowns and face shields during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \"We really do need to pay close attention to proper education, treating fear, making sure that people have the right things and use the right things at the right times,\" Dr. Alex Mitchell told CBC's Information Morning on Friday. Mitchell, a general surgeon, became medical co-lead of a special PPE working group in the middle of March to take stock of the province's stockpile, and to make sure there were enough supplies to make it through the pandemic.   He said his team quickly realized they needed to train coaches, many of them front-line health-care workers themselves, to share best practices. The coaches are working at hospitals across the province. Dr. Alex Mitchell is a general surgeon and medical co-lead for the province's PPE working group.   (CBC) They explain to doctors, nurses and other health-care workers about how to get the gear on and off safely and when to use it.   \"We really strongly encourage the use of a personal-risk assessment, in which a health-care worker assesses the situation in front of them and makes the appropriate choice of PPE at that moment,\ " Mitchell said. Reusing equipment He said health agencies in the U.S. and Canada have now begun approving \"reprocessing methods\" so personal protective equipment, like masks, can be reused. He said N95 masks could be used with proper sanitization and cleaning \"anywhere from three-to-10 times instead of throwing it away.\ " \"Reuse has evolved ... as an entirely viable option to help sustain your supply of particular materials,\" he said. \"And we've actually invested significantly in processes and plans to reprocess gear.\" Fourth person dies from COVID-19 in Nova Scotia as cases rise to 606 Nova Scotia businesses shifting production to make PPE for health-care workers The two biggest concerns he hears from health-care workers is whether the equipment will protect them from the virus, and if there will be enough of it, he said.   In early March, the World Health Organization cautioned that a shortage of PPE worldwide was putting lives at risk. Some provinces are rationing supplies and urging front-line workers to use one mask per shift.   Earlier this week, Premier Stephen McNeil said he was confident in the province's supply of masks on the same day he announced all long-term care workers would now be required to wear surgical masks around patients.   \"The stock at any given time is generally quite healthy to manage day-to-day operations,\ " Mitchell said.   Local supply very important Mitchell said Nova Scotia had a good stockpile of supplies before his group formed last month. \"The challenge is … then making sure that those orders come and that those orders are usable,\" he said. The key, said Mitchell, is finding new companies closer to home that can make the supplies.  Several Nova Scotia businesses have pivoted during the pandemic to begin making masks, gowns and face shields for front-line workers. Several companies, including MacKenzie Atlantic in Dartmouth, have begun producing equipment such as face fields.   (Submitted by Carmen MacKenzie) There have been an \"enormous number of lessons\" throughout the process, Mitchell said, including a better understanding of the importance of local sources. \"I think we learned very quickly with something like this the challenges and the potential instability of what appears to be a very stable global market and how quickly that can unravel,\" he said.   On Friday, the province announced a fourth person had died because of COVID-19 as the number of cases surpassed 600.

  One million Chinese-made N95 respirator masks that didn't meet Canada's quality control standards are being examined by public health officials to see if they can be used in non-medical settings, according to a senior government official. The official, speaking on background, said the masks were delivered the week of April 6 and testing showed they didn't meet a standard that would allow them to completely filter out virus particles. The official said further testing will determine whether they can be used by other sections of the workforce. If they can't, they will be returned to the manufacturer and replaced at no cost to Canada.   The masks are part of 5.3 million N95 respirators the federal government has received from domestic and international suppliers as of April 23. Public Services and Procurement Canada has ordered more than 155 million N95s and is awaiting further shipments. All masks ordered by the federal government are first counted by federal officials, with help from members of the Canadian Forces, before being turned over to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) for testing.   Once equipment such as surgical-grade masks, gloves, gowns, face shields and other gear has been cleared by PHAC, they are distributed to health care workers across the country. Watch:  Federal Public Services Minister Anita Anand updates reporters on PPE shipments from China: Federal Public Services minister Anita Anand spoke to reporters on Friday 2:03 Since the beginning of the pandemic, the federal government has been in a bidding war with other countries trying to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line health care workers. \"Much of the world's supply is manufactured in China and moving materials out of that country is highly complex,\" Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Friday. PPE supplies received so far \"I want to reassure Canadians that we continue to adjust and refine our logistical and diplomatic approaches on the ground, not just in response to supply chain challenges but in anticipation of these challenges,\ " she said. According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, as of April 22 the federal government has received:  12,280,525 pairs of nitrile gloves out of more than one billion ordered.   18,021,500 surgical-grade masks out of more than 333.5 million ordered.   1,035,000 pairs of vinyl gloves of more than 10 million ordered. 43,258 units of hand sanitizer out of almost 80 million units ordered.   The federal government also has ordered 34,849,000 face shields, 118,405,120 gowns and 32,070 ventilators. Deliveries of all three of these products are expected to begin arriving in government warehouses the week of April 27.   Canada building its own PPE network in ChinaFront BurnerIn brief: Global scramble for PPE is 'utter , cutthroat chaos' Millions more units of PPE have been received by federal officials but are currently being inventoried before being sent to PHAC for testing and distribution. All of the equipment purchased by the federal government comes on top of any PPE purchases being made by the provinces and territories. \"Progress is being made,\ " Anand said. \"We have received six planeloads carrying supplies from China since last Friday alone, and over 10 carriers have brought goods back to Canada ... from China.\" Canadian industry stepping up The federal government has struck deals with a number of Canadian companies to provide additional supplies. The sporting goods company Bauer of Blainville, Que., has repurposed hockey skate production lines to make plastic face shields. Fluid Energy Group in Calgary and Irving Oil in Saint John, N.B., are both providing hand sanitizer to the federal government.

Level-1 masks provide the lowest level of protection but can be used by medical professionals to cover N95 respirators, or in settings where people are not dealing with confirmed cases of the disease. The company said 50 employees working two shifts will soon be used to produce the masks. GM Canada's biggest union, Unifor, has signed off on the plan. \"The project still requires completion of additional work with our governments and our Unifor partners, and we will provide updates as we get ready to begin production,\ " the company said in a statement, adding that the masks will be sold to authorities at cost. 
  A Fredericton man and his family who have been stuck in the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak for the last three weeks are scheduled to head home on a government-chartered flight back to Canada. Mike Schellenberg, his wife Summer and one-year-old son Felix went to visit the Wuhan area about a month ago.   Fredericton man stranded near virus-stricken Wuhan hoping Ottawa will bring his family home The family has been staying at Schellenberg's in-laws' home in Honghu, China, about 45 kilometres from Wuhan, since the start of the outbreak. Schellenberg's wife, who's a Chinese national with a Canadian Visa, was allowed on the flight because she has a young son. The family exhibits no symptoms of the virus.   Schellenberg is relieved to be on his way home with his family, and he's looking forward to eating pizza and hamburgers. \"I could go for some real cheese,\ " he said from his in-law's home on Tuesday, speaking to CBC News.   The family received an email from the Canadian government Monday saying there would be spots for them on a flight home scheduled to leave Wednesday. \"I was surprised at how quickly it transpired, I thought it would for sure be a couple more days,\ " Schellenberg said.   The flight was delayed, however, and a specific departure date has not yet been confirmed because Canada is still awaiting final approval and clearance. The chartered aircraft seats 250 people. Champagne advises Canadians to leave China by commercial means as repatriation effort continues Once the family arrives in Canada they'll be in isolation at the Canadian Armed Forces base in Trenton, Ont. for two weeks, as is mandatory for those returning from China to Canada.   \"Obviously I'm not thrilled, but it's absolutely necessary that we do it.\" Information about the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast, but what do we actually know about the illness? CBC News medical contributor and family physician Dr. Peter Lin breaks down the facts about what it is, where it came from, how it spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. 5:10 The family became stuck in China after encountering a bit of misfortune before the coronavirus outbreak was declared.   Schellenberg and his family planned to return to Fredericton before Christmas. But, complications with their son's visa delayed their trip home.   Wuhan under lockdown amid virus outbreak Wuhan is under a city-wide quarantine.   Even though Schellenberg's in-laws live 45 kilometres away from Wuhan, most people there are staying indoors, too.   \"Things here are pretty, I wouldn't say normal, but nothing's really happening. Everyone just stays home.\ "  Items like face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizer are sold out at most stores, Schellenberg said. He once went to eight different pharmacies looking for supplies.   \"I went to the Walmart, I went everywhere and there was none. People were even scalping them online … There are people arrested for selling them like five times the actual price online.\"   There have been 490 deaths and 24,324 confirmed cases on mainland China. Two cruise ships, one off the coast of Hong Kong and another off the coast of Japan, are under quarantine because of an outbreak of the virus as well.   The Public Health Agency of Canada says the risk to Canadians from coronavirus is low. Five cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada so far.   There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Brunswick. A website has been established by the provincial government with information on the virus and preventative measures. 
  Quebec has 3,430 confirmed cases and 25 deaths attributable to COVID-19. There are 235 people in hospital, including 78 in intensive care. Montreal, where a local state of emergency was renewed Sunday, has about half of those cases, with 1,612. Grocery stores will be closed on Sundays in April.   A Hasidic Jewish community north of Montreal is under quarantine after a spike in infections. The province rolled out Open School today, an online education platform to help students keep up with learning. Travel into certain Quebec regions with vulnerable populations is being restricted by police checkpoints. The Quebec government has made physical distancing instructions available in more than a dozen languages, including Arabic, Creole, Tagalog and Farsi.    Quebec registered nearly 600 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, and three more deaths, but Premier François Legault said the province's health-care system remains able to handle the situation. Though the overall increase in new cases was large on Monday, the rate of increase was 21 per cent compared to a day earlier, roughly on par with last week's increases.   Hospitalizations are also up — there are now 78 people receiving intensive care — but, again, these figures are growing at rates that authorities believe the health-care system can handle. \"Our health-care system is in control because there remains capacity for what will come next,\ " Legault said at his daily news conference in Quebec City. Quebec has more than 500 intensive care beds and is readying 500 more by cancelling elective surgeries.   Workers in the system, though, are worried supplies of personal protective equipment are running low, putting them at risk of catching the virus. In Montreal alone, 82 health-care workers have tested positive for COVID-19, city health officials said Sunday.    Legault acknowledged that the supply of face masks and other protective items is limited in Quebec, but he said every country is confronting the same shortage.   Planning is underway to boost supplies either from orders abroad or by manufacturing the materials in the province. Legault, along with Health Minister Danielle McCann and Quebec's public health director, Dr. Horacio Arruda, implored everyone in the province to restrict their use of such materials.   \"They have to be used at the right place by the right people,\ " McCann said. Health-care workers are shown at a drive-thru COVID-19 test clinic in Montreal on Sunday. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) Though widely praised so far for its handling of the outbreak, Legault's government is being watched carefully as it addresses working conditions in the public sector.   The collective agreements of 500,000 public-sector employees — including those working in education and health care — are set to expire tomorrow, Tuesday. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world March 30 Also set to expire are the added premiums paid to thousands of heath-care service providers, including workers at long-term care institutions, which house those most at risk of dying from COVID-19. Legault declined to go into detail about the negotiations but said he wanted to offer higher salaries for service providers going forward.   \"We have to be able to keep our people working in the health-care system for a long time,\ " he said.   More money to protect the elderly With the three latest deaths announced Monday, a total of 25 people have now died in Quebec from COVID-19. All of them were over the age of 60. Most of the deceased lived in either private or public long-term care institutions Earlier in the day, the Quebec government announced $133 million in emergency funds for seniors' residences and other institutions or agencies that work with vulnerable groups to help them deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Health Minister Danielle McCann implored everyone in the province to limit their use of face masks and similar gear — protective equipment in short supply that's needed by health-care workers. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press) \"With this emergency aid, we will be able to hire more staff, buy more protective equipment and more disinfectant,\" said Marguerite Blais, the minister responsible for seniors and informal caregivers. \"We are giving ourselves the means to take better care of our seniors and, above all, better protect them.\ " The breakdown of the funds includes $40 million for private seniors' residences, $20 million for private and public long-term care institutions (CHSLDs), and $73 million for intermediate-level care homes and small, family-based care homes. Quarantine in Hasidic Jewish community of Tash Authorities were also moving quickly on Monday to contain outbreaks in other areas of the province where people live and work in close contact with each other. A Hasidic Jewish community north of Montreal known as Tash was placed under quarantine Sunday after more than dozen members tested positive for COVID-19. The quarantine was set up in collaboration with community leaders, police and public health officials. It is believed members of the ultra-Orthodox community caught the virus when they travelled to New York earlier this month to celebrate Purim with other Hasidic communities. Quebec public health authorities placed the Jewish ultra-Orthodox community of Tosh under quarantine after a number of members tested positive for COVID-19. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) And at two federal corrections facilities in Quebec, prisoners are being confined to their cells because several staff members have come down with the virus. Correctional Services Canada said nine employees at the maximum security Port Cartier Institution, on Quebec's North Shore, and two at the Joliette prison, northeast of Montreal, have been infected. Keeping the inmates in their cells will prevent the disease from spreading further, the corrections service said. Closing grocery stores on Sundays Quebec is now entering its third week of imposed physical-distancing measures and other strict public-health directives. Quebec, along with Ontario, shut down all non-essential economic activity last week. The \"pause\" is set to last at least until Easter, April 13.   Legault began his news conference Monday noting the toll on mental health that the outbreak has taken on Quebecers, but he made it clear it will be at least several more weeks before society returns to normal. \"If you feel like you're losing control, don't hesitate to call someone,\ " Legault said. CBC ExplainsHow to make sense of the number of COVID-19 cases in Quebec The Health Ministry is in the process of contacting 325,000 Quebecers on file who have mental health issues to see how they are coping, McCann said. The province will also compel grocery stores to close Sundays in April, Legault said, in order to give exhausted workers a break.   Gas stations, convenience stores and pharmacies will remain open. At a checkpoint set up on the U.S.-Canada border in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, police inform Quebecers returning to the province about quarantine regulations.   (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) 
  Premier Jason Kenney announced Saturday the province would be sending personal protective equipment or PPE to other provinces battling COVID-19. Kenney made the announcement from an Alberta Health Services (AHS) warehouse while espousing the province's readiness for the pandemic. \"Our numbers are far lower than the hardest hit areas of Europe, the United States and significantly lower than we've seen in provinces like Quebec and Ontario,\" he said.   Kenney said Alberta is so far outperforming the probable scenario of models released earlier this week, which predicted as many as 800,000 infections. \"We are at about one quarter of the modelled levels under the probable scenario for today, and that is very good news,\ " he said, adding it was not reason to halt collective efforts to stop the spread.   Seven new COVID-19 deaths in Alberta, highest daily number so far What you need to know about COVID-19 in Alberta on Saturday, April 11   Kenney said the numbers supported the belief that Alberta would have beds and medical equipment beyond its need. According to the news release, Ontario will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2.5 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves. 87,000 goggles. 50 ventilators.   Quebec will receive:  250,000 N95 masks. 2 million procedural masks. 15 million gloves.   British Columbia is set to receive 250,000 N95 masks. The premier also gave an update on COVID-19 cases in the province, adding 69 confirmed cases to bring the provincial total to 1,569. There are 216 cases suspected of being acquired in the community.   He also reported an additional death from the McKenzie Towne continuing care facility in Calgary, bringing the total number of deaths at the facility to 18. WATCH | How Alberta stockpiled medical equipment before COVID-19 struck: Alberta Health Services started ordering personal protective equipment (PPE) as coronavirus was taking hold in China and is now able to help other provinces in need of gloves, masks and ventilators.   1:46 This brings the total numbers of deaths in the province to 40. In the Calgary zone, 28 died from COVID-19, seven in the Edmonton zone, four in the North zone, and one person has died in the Central zone. Forty-seven Albertans were hospitalized — one fewer than on Friday — and 13 in intensive care units. A total of 774 people have recovered, according to the premier. The province is also making it a requirement for continuing care workers to wear masks at all times when providing direct patient care or working in patient-care areas, starting next week. ' The right thing to do' Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Alberta's modelling indicates the health-care system can handle the peak of the disease. By the end of April, Shandro said, AHS would have 2,250 acute care beds, almost 1,100 ICU beds, and 760 ventilators — more than double the current count. He said the province had recently signed contracts valued at more than $200 million, including for millions of gowns and N95 masks. Shandro said the province is in a position to ensure Albertans' health as well as support other Canadian health-care systems. \"This is the right thing to do,\" he said at the press conference. \"I assure all Albertans that we will have ample supply.\ " The province says the equipment will begin shipping next week. 
  Amid the global coronavirus outbreak, masks have been flying off shelves in cities across the country and viral videos are sparking concern over paramedics spotted in protective gear. In one recent instance, video footage from a flight from China to Toronto showed Peel paramedics decked out in various types of masks — including one wearing a full clear-plastic face cover — while transporting a patient off the flight. The footage got thousands of views and shares after being re-posted by different accounts, and prompted plenty of speculation over the patient having coronavirus. But Brad Bowie, the community relations officer for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, says it wasn't a suspected coronavirus case at all, though the video was indeed showing paramedics taking standard precautions. So what's the real purpose of personal protective equipment for paramedics? And what does it have to do with the virus that's spreading to countries around the world? CBC Toronto spoke to experts like Bowie to break it all down: When do paramedics wear protective gear? Anytime their own health could be at risk, paramedics don protective gear, says Bowie. That means if a patient is coughing, sneezing, or bleeding profusely — when airborne droplets or bodily fluids are flowing  — it's time to suit up. Sometimes that decision happens on-site, but there's also pre-screening in place so paramedics know what they're getting in to. Paramedics have various types of masks to choose from. Sometimes this full face protection is required if first responders can't wear other types of masks due to their facial shape or even facial hair. (Paul Borkwood/CBC News) Dineen Robinson, a spokesperson for Toronto Paramedic Services, says its communications centre screens for a \"range of emerging infectious diseases\" when patients call with respiratory or gastrointestinal issues and have recently travelled outside of Canada. \"Any such information that is obtained from callers is then communicated to frontline staff attending those calls for emergency service,\ " she says. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the province has also implemented \"enhanced screening measures\" at all emergency medical services' communication centres to identify potential cases before dispatching paramedics, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health in Ontario, recently said. What protective gear is available? Bowie says there's a whole slate of personal protective equipment, or PPE, available to paramedics. Gloves are an everyday staple worn on all calls, he says. There are also face shields to protect paramedics from airborne droplets, and a variety of masks. Canada negotiates details of airlift as WHO declares global health emergency over coronavirus Gowns are also available, and in rare cases paramedics will resort to full-body covering — but that's usually just for extreme cases of infectious, potentially-deadly diseases. Why so many different masks? Generally, paramedics will put on a disposable N-95 respirator mask; they're usually white, sometimes duck-bill shaped, and loop around the back of your head. It's a simple way to protect someone from breathing in 95 per cent of all airborne particles, be it droplets from a patient coughing or dangerous dust or mould. Paramedics don personal protective equipment for a variety of potential illnesses, not just the new coronavirus. (Paul Borkwood/CBC News) But Bowie says the style doesn't work for all paramedics, who are regularly fit-tested to make sure they've got a mask that protects them. At times, some people need different styles of mask to accommodate certain facial sizes or structures, skin reactions, or even facial hair like a beard. ' The fear is the same' — lessons learned from past pandemics applied to coronavirus Those paramedics might need to upgrade to other styles, including a full face shield that has a tube to filter in clean air. If you see the gear, does that mean the patient has coronavirus? It's possible, but probably not. Bowie says protective gear is a precaution for a variety of medical issues, including the new coronavirus. But it's definitely not a clear indication of the type or severity of a patient's illness  — it's just a way for paramedics to protect themselves and their loved ones from getting sick. Infectious disease expert Dr. Allison McGeer tells The National about the spread of coronavirus and if masks really help. 1:49 \"We're going to wear that gear for any respiratory disease ... someone who's got a bit of a temperature, a cough,\" Bowie explains. Canada's chief public health officer condemns racist acts linked to coronavirus outbreak The equipment and guidelines \"are not new to our staff and are part of normal practice,\ " echoes Robinson, speaking for Toronto Paramedic Services. \"These are the same precautions that frontline staff use when dealing with any type of infectious disease, including SARS and Ebola.\" But given current concerns about coronavirus, Bowie adds, people may spot paramedics wearing the gear on a more regular basis. Do precautions have anything to do with SARS? Clinicians learned a lot from the deadly SARS outbreak in Toronto, which helped boost infection control protocols and prompted widespread adoption of personal protective gear, Bowie says. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also spread from a strain of coronavirus. The illness killed hundreds of people and afflicted thousands more around the world in the early 2000s — and in the Toronto area, it mainly hit healthcare workers.   (Supplied by Toronto Paramedic Services) Bowie says before that wake-up call, emergency responders didn't worry much about protective gear. \"We didn't always think about wearing gloves. We didn't always think about wearing masks,\" he says. \"It just wasn't on our radar as daily safety precautions.\ " U.S. reports 1st case of person-to-person spread of coronavirus The bottom line nowadays? It's better to be safe than sick. \"Paramedics are going to spend a lot of time in the back of an ambulance with these patients,\ " Bowie says. \"So they've got to protect themselves.\"
  Major Toronto hospitals are rationing surgical masks amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in some cases, even urging nurses and other front-line staff to use just one mask for an entire shift, according to memos obtained by CBC News. Provincial officials have said there are enough supplies in Ontario for health-care workers, and that more masks have been ordered and are on the way. But some front-line workers in the Greater Toronto Area say they feel their safety is increasingly at risk. \"They're treating us like we're disposable,\" said a veteran nurse from Markham Stouffville Hospital, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation from hospital management. According to a memo sent to staff on Monday that was obtained by CBC News, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto is now issuing a single procedure mask to health-care workers each day. A hospital source told CBC News that a nurse would typically go through five or six of these masks over the course of a 12-hour shift.   \"It is important that we conserve procedure masks for the duration of this pandemic, which will go on for some time,\" the memo reads. It also notes that masks must be discarded and replaced if they become soiled or contaminated. \"The main value of masking, like self-screening, is to keep the environment safe for all,\" the notice reads. The province of Ontario says it has has secured 12 million sets of surgical gloves, a million N95 respirators and nearly six million more surgical masks. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Sinai Health spokesperson Barbara McCully told CBC News in an email that this move is a \"short-term measure\" that was put in place this week as the organization transitions to a new policy outlining mask use during the pandemic, which is \"currently being finalized and will be released shortly.\ " In another memo obtained through a source within Unity Health Toronto, which operates St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre, management said that as of Tuesday evening, all staff would only get two masks to wear over the course of their work period. Unity Health spokesperson Jennifer Stranges told CBC news in an email that as of this time, Unity Health's supply of protective equipment is \"sufficient.\" \"We are being conservative and using personal protective equipment rationally to maintain a safe environment for our patients, residents, staff and physicians,\ " she said. Anyone who is \"patient-facing\" is also now required to wear a procedure mask at all times in patient areas and common spaces, the notice reads. It also says that masks should be replaced if soiled or ripped. \"We do have a limited supply of [personal protective equipment],\ " the memo reads. \"Unless we all work together and use [it] appropriately, we will have shortages.\" 'We are in a war' COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly between people through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. N95 respirators are believed to provide increased protection compared to surgical masks. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario has called on the provincial and federal governments to supply front-line health-care workers with more personal protective equipment, including masks, and is warning there's already a shortage at hospitals across the province. \"The evidence of asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 necessitates that all health-care workers facing patients, residents and clients wear a surgical mask at all times,\ " the organization said in a news release on Wednesday. \"We are in a war and the enemy is the COVID-19 virus.\" INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayOntario's COVID-19 death total jumps Wednesday, with 100 new cases confirmed  The province has repeatedly said it's working hard to ensure health-care workers have the protection they need. As of Tuesday, the government said it had secured 12 million sets of surgical gloves, a million N95 respirators and nearly six million more surgical masks. The provincial government is also looking at deploying a stockpile of some 55 million expired N95 masks that it stockpiled after the SARS crisis in 2003.   Ministry of Health spokesperson Hayley Chazan said that the federal government has also promised to provide Ontario with another 500,000 N95 respirators and one million masks. \"We expect these supplies to be delivered at various times over the coming days and weeks,\ " she said in an email. ' Canaries in the coal mine' Vicki McKenna, president of the Ontario Nurses Association, said guidelines concerning N95 masks have been loosened by many hospitals. \"I started to get calls from nurses [Tuesday] saying we had N95 masks for those of us working with COVID patients or those we were screening or people who were presumed, but now we don't,\ " she told CBC News. Markham Stouffville Hospital spokesperson Rebecca MacKenzie said in an email to CBC News that there are a \"limited number of N95 masks available globally.   \"Using N95 masks in settings where they are not necessary could create a supply shortage that would put staff and physicians involved in aerosol generating procedures on COVID-19 patients at great risk,\" she said. But McKenna says care facilities should listen more closely to nurses on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle. \"They are the canaries in the coal mine,\ " she said.

As of early evening, there were 3,133 deaths, and 51,597 cases.   The news came just after Manitoba became the latest province to release details on how it plans to lift COVID-19 restrictions and restart some sectors of the economy, with Premier Brian Pallister saying people will be dealing with a new normal as officials try to prevent a \"COVID comeback.\ "  Pallister said some restrictions will be lifted beginning May 4.  Non-urgent health care, ranging from dentistry and physiotherapy to elective surgery, will be allowed to operate again. Rules around outdoor recreation will also be loosened, though physical distancing will still be important, the premier said.   Some retail businesses — including clothing stores, restaurant patios and hair salons — will also be allowed to reopen.   \"We must remain vigilant, and we must remain committed — we do not want a COVID comeback.\ " In all cases, Pallister said, businesses will need to follow public health guidelines and ensure a safe experience for both staff and customers.

As for schools, Pallister said Manitoba is in the \"early days\" of the COVID-19 recovery and the presence of a large number of kids in a school makes social distancing a challenge. The province \"isn't entertaining\" the idea of opening schools at this time, he said. The second phase, which would include more personal services and indoor dining rooms, doesn't have a firm date attached, but the province said it would be no sooner than June 1.   Members of the Canadian Armed Forces take part in a training session before deploying to seniors residences Wednesday in Montreal. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Pallister's move came a day after Quebec announced that some businesses in the hard-hit province will be reopening in May, with Premier François Legault saying the challenge is to \"gradually restart the economy without restarting the pandemic.\" Canada has more than 50,000 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases, with more than 3,000 COVID-19-related deaths, according to a CBC News tally based on provincial data, local health information and CBC's reporting.  Quebec accounts for 26,594 of the cases and 1,761 deaths. Legault outlined a plan that would allow some retail, construction and manufacturing operations to resume at some point next month. But the premier emphasized that the reopening of some businesses doesn't mean that people should be congregating in groups or ignoring public health guidelines. He also stressed the importance of continuing to protect the vulnerable, particularly those living in the province's long-term care homes, which have seen devastating and deadly outbreaks.   ANALYSIS | Why Legault feels it's safe to reopen economy, even though Quebec hit hardest MPs meet in House to debate emergency COVID-19 aid for students   At their daily briefing Wednesday, federal health officials stressed that the virus is still spreading, and that people need to keep following the guidelines for lowering the risk, such as physical distancing and hand washing.   Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam also urged workplaces to have \"good plans\" for when they start to reopen and employees return.   WATCH | 'We need to do better,' says Dr. Theresa Tam: Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the COVID-19 virus has pointed out deficiencies in workplaces' health and safety practices. 1:38 Prince Edward Island, which has just 27 cases (with 24 considered recovered) also outlined its initial reopening plan on Tuesday. The small province is taking a phased approach — and like Saskatchewan and Quebec, it has attached specific dates to some early stages.   On May 1, P.E.I. will allow non-urgent health care to resume, a move that covers everything from cancer screenings to optometrist visits. There will also be some loosening of social restrictions, as non-related groups of up to five people will be allowed to visit — provided they are outside and at least two metres apart.   Phase 2, which allows small indoor and slightly larger outdoor gatherings, as well as more business openings, is set for May 22. Phase 3, which allows even larger gatherings and reopens some personal services, recreation facilities and restaurants in a limited way, is set for June 12. There's no date attached to Phase 4, which the province describes as the \"new normal\" for P.E.I. \"We need to be cautious, we need to be careful and we need to be methodical,\" P.E.I.

  Public health officials in North America initially discouraged healthy people from wearing masks, saying there's no evidence they provide effective protection against the spread of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. But recently, some, including those in Canada and the U.S., have said that wearing non-medical masks in tandem with physical distancing measures could limit the transmission of the virus.   Officials in Asia have long encouraged it. Additionally, health workers in the U.S. Canada say they need masks for protection and are struggling with shortages. Here's a closer look at what public health officials and the research says about who should wear a mask, how to wear one properly and what kind of protection it offers. What are the different kinds of masks, and what protection do they offer? There are three main types of masks that are available:   N95: These are tight-fitting masks that are designed to seal around the nose and mouth and screen out 95 per cent of small airborne particles. They're likely to prevent transmission of aerosolized virus —  those suspended as a mist in the air. Because of that, they're used by health-care workers in specific medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube or bronchoscopy (imaging someone's lungs and air passages), said Dr. Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton. Surgical or medical masks : These are looser fitting, more flexible disposable masks that are considered effective barriers against large droplets released by talking, coughing or sneezing —  the main way COVID-19 is likely transmitted. Non-medical cloth masks : You may have seen volunteers sewing these reusable, washable masks for distribution, and some hospitals in the United States were even asking for them as a last resort because of shortages of other kinds of masks. At least one Toronto hospital has requested such masks for people who don't work in health care, such as hospital visitors or recently discharged patients. However, Gardam notes they're quite porous and their effectiveness hasn't been studied much.   WATCH |  Dr. Samir Gupta explains what you should consider before putting on a mask against COVID-19: Dr. Samir Gupta provides crucial information about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and what to think about before putting one on. 2:30 Which mask is recommended for health-care workers? For everyday medical care, recommendations vary, said Loeb. For example, the U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of N95 masks, but the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends a medical mask, and Ontario previously recommended N95 and is now recommending medical masks. However, Loeb said N95 masks are definitely needed for special medical procedures that generate aerosols. The World Health Organization says cloth masks are not recommended for health-care workers \"under any circumstances.\" A worker inspects a finished N95 face mask while wearing a medical mask in a 2009 photo. While medical masks protect against droplets from someone coughing or sneezing, N95 masks also protect against aerosols, which can be produced during medical procedures like inserting a breathing tube. (Romeo Ranoco/Reuters) How effectively do masks protect health-care workers? Consistent use of either N95 or surgical masks reduced infection with SARS, another coronavirus, by roughly 80 per cent among health-care workers, said Loeb, based on both his own research and a study by another research group. Both the SARS studies and a more recent study on a variety of respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, didn't find a big difference in protection between the two kinds of masks for regular medical procedures. Loeb is currently setting up a randomized control trial to confirm whether there is a difference for COVID-19. However, Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto's Humber River Hospital, noted that masks are never used alone as personal protective equipment by health-care workers —  they go with face shields, gowns and gloves. The one randomized clinical trial of cloth masks in a health-care setting for protection against respiratory illness — done on influenza, not COVID-19 — found that they let through 97 per cent of virus particles and actually increased the rate of infection among health-care workers. That same study found surgical masks failed to block 44 per cent of virus particles. The authors of that 2015 study recently wrote an addendum to their research because they have received so many questions about it since the coronavirus pandemic began. Canada's top doctor says non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19Analysis'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus N95, medical and cloth masks (CBC) When are masks recommended for members of the public? N95 masks are not generally recommended for the public in North America for protection against disease. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask at home, if you:   Have symptoms, like coughing or sneezing, as it can reduce contagious droplets from being sprayed around you.    Are caring for someone with a suspected COVID-19 infection.    Outside these circumstances, the WHO says medical masks should be reserved for health care workers. Although initially public health officials in North America and Europe said healthy people didn't need to wear masks in public and people with respiratory symptoms shouldn't be leaving their homes at all, more recently, they have said that non-medical masks can be an additional measure to protect those physically close to you by reducing the chances of some of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with them. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public places where other physical distancing measures are hard to maintain (such as grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas with community-based transmission. On April 6, Dr. Theresa Tam, the top doctor at the Public Health Agency of Canada, also suggested using non-medical masks when out grocery shopping or at a pharmacy. However, she noted the mask protects people around the mask wearer, not necessarily the person wearing it. That same day, the World Health Organization said there is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of such masks by the general public — but it encourages countries that recommend this kind of mask usage to conduct research on the topic. WATCH | Can cloth masks protect you from COVID-19? Two doctors weigh in: Doctors answer your questions about the coronavirus, including whether people should be wearing homemade or cloth masks when they are outside. 3:30 What's the proper way to use a mask? WHO recommends:     Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.    Avoid touching the mask while using it and clean your hands if you do.    Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it's damp and don't reuse single-use masks.    Remove it from behind, discard immediately into a closed bin and then clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    WATCH | What is the correct way to wear and dispose of masks?   How effective are masks at protecting you against respiratory infections such as COVID-19? We don't know specifically for COVID-19, but studies of families where someone has the flu show mask usage is not that effective at preventing transmission, said Gardam, an infectious disease physician. \"It's not at all the dramatic reduction that you would want.\ " That's probably because the masks have to be used properly and consistently all the time, he said.   A man demonstrates how to put on a face mask and other protective clothing during a tour of a COVID-19 evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. Health-care workers don't use masks alone, but also face shields, gowns and gloves. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) On the other hand, \"it's not going to hurt. It might help,\" he said. But he noted frequent handwashing and keeping at least two metres away from other people are probably more effective and still need to be used in conjunction with a mask. Why shouldn't healthy people wear N95 or medical masks while in public? The World Health Organization lists four reasons, saying the masks may:  Create a false sense of security and cause people to be less vigilant about hand-washing and physical distancing. Lead to people touching their face under the mask or under the eyes (to adjust the mask or scratch itches). Generate unnecessary costs. Take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially where there are shortages.   The latter is a big concern for Loeb. \"People are walking down the street with these masks,\ " he said, \"And I think that's a waste.\ " Ordinary people should be physical distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19, he said. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out: \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited.\ " In a follow-up interview on April 7, Gardam agreed, but said he is also concerned that people may mistakenly think masks in general protect the wearer rather than others, and get a false sense of security. \"I just worry that it might unintentionally encourage them to get out more, and I don't really want to do that,\ " he said. He added that anecdotally, he's noticed that people wearing masks seem less likely to move over and engage in proper physical distancing when encountering others. Can I clean and reuse my N95 mask?

A woman wearing a protective face mask walks down to Oxford Circus underground station at rush hour in London on Monday.   (Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Are there exceptions where healthy people should wear masks in public? Maybe. In a recent article in the Lancet, researchers led by Elaine Shuo Feng, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested it would be \"rational\" to recommend wearing face masks in public for:   Healthy people in quarantine (or self-isolation) if they need to leave home for any reason. Vulnerable people, such as older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.   Gardam said while wearing a mask makes \"zero sense\" while walking down the street, there is a logic to using one if you're forced to be in an enclosed space, such as public transit or a crowded grocery store (although many grocery stores are now limiting the number of customers inside) — circumstances where non-medical masks are now recommended by both Canada and the U.S. A woman wearing a face mask queues to enter a supermarket in Honduras on March 19.   Experts say physical distancing and handwashing are the top ways of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and masks aren't necessary if people are maintaining a proper distance — two metres — from others. (Jorge Cabrera/Reuters) Why is there so much more mask-wearing in Asia and among Asian people? In Asian countries, there are many circumstances where mask-wearing is recommended or required, according to Feng's paper, which looked into the variation. For example, in China, as part of strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, some provinces and municipalities make face masks compulsory in public areas, and it's recommended while shopping or in gatherings of children and students. Hong Kong specifically recommends masks when taking in public transit or staying in crowded places. CBC ExplainsHow to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisisYour guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada The researchers also said that for cultural reasons, masks are considered a hygienic practice even for healthy people in Asia, while in North America it's considered something only sick people do.

(Tyrone Siu/Reuters) Are there possible advantages to everyone wearing masks? Feng's study suggested two possible advantages:   It might reduce community transmission, since there's evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms begin. It could reduce discrimination and racial aggression against people who wear masks.   Some people have argued that universal mask-wearing is one of the \"pillars of success\" behind successful action to curb COVID-19 transmission in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Gardam said he thinks that's a false argument, because those countries took many measures, and it's impossible to say whether or how much of a difference universal mask-wearing made.

Medical experts say there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are avoiding contact with other people as they're supposed to be. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) For now, what's the take-home message on masks? Hopefully, wearing non-medical masks will help protect other people, Loeb said in a follow-up interview on April 7.  \"But it should not be done at the expense of physical distancing.\" Gardam agreed, saying it's still scientifically debatable whether mask-wearing by the public helps curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The one strategy where there's actually no debate is physical distancing.\ " He also wants to make sure people understand that if masks offer protection, it's for people around the mask wearer, not the person wearing the mask. \"So, by all means, wear your masks — just know why you're wearing them and don't stop the other stuff you're doing.\ "   WATCH | How to properly wash your hands: Using “glo germ,” a product that shows up under black light, Andrew Chang takes a first-hand look at how germs are transmitted, and how to wash them off our hands effectively. 7:03

But there's a looming shortage.   PPE is 'the new contraband' PPE in the province has been earmarked for hospitals, family doctors and other medical staff. Alberta's funeral homes are running out.   \"It will be a concern the longer that this goes on,\" said Evan Strong, the owner of Evan J. Strong Funeral Home. He added he understands the necessary hierarchy of PPE distribution, but wants the government to understand the position funeral homes are in as well. There have been questions about whether a deceased person can transmit COVID-19, but Health Canada has no clear answer at this point.   The virus can live on surfaces for varying lengths of time. Stephanie Smith, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, said it's possible for the virus to live on a body but the risk is lower.   A person wears personal protective equipment, which includes an N95 respirator, mask and nitrile gloves. Some of this gear is used by funeral homes when handling the deceased. (CBC/Radio-Canada) \"Any kind of infection would have to be transmitted directly from touching the deceased person and then touching one's face, nose, mouth,\" she said.   She said despite that, the difficulty funeral homes are having trying to procure PPE should be addressed.   Alberta recently sent millions of pieces of the medical equipment to Ontario, Quebec, B.C. and the Northwest Territories. \"PPE is kind of the new contraband,\ " Smith said. \"Everyone in the world is trying to access it.\ " The province says they're working to get gear to funeral homes. In the meantime, requests for PPE can be sent directly to them. Funeral business suffering like other industries Like most other businesses in the province, COVID-19 hasn't been kind to funeral homes.   \"With some families electing to do reduced or no services, of course the side effect is that our revenues will be down and therefore our bottom line,\ " Root said. Funerals, like the rest of public gatherings, are beholden to the chief medical officer of health's public restrictions. Currently, that means no more than 15 people spaced two metres apart. Anyone found violating those rules can be fined $1,000. As the concerns of infections and staff safety dominate the planning funeral homes are doing, there are also thoughts about what this means for the future.   Funeral home chapels like this one are often closed because of COVID-19 gathering restrictions.   (Pierson's Funeral Service) The future of funerals Death is an estimated $1.6 billion business in Canada and the business model hasn't been overhauled in some time. COVID-19 could be the start of a transformation.   \"This is changing how we grieve,\" Strong said.   With families unable to gather, many in-person funeral services are obsolete. Instead, funeral homes are turning to the Internet.   Many are starting to offer a livestream of services and are opening online portals to upload photos. Funerals are going digital.   P.E.I. funeral homes worry about 'potential of becoming infected,' prepare for COVID-19 deathsCOVID-19 pandemic changing how Windsor-Essex funerals are conducted Strong says he sees this as part of the job. \"What we focus on [now] is trying to come up with creative ways or helpful ways that the family can still mourn and celebrate the life.\ " Both funeral home directors say the toughest part has been seeing the grief families are experiencing while spread so far apart.   \"We're being unique and innovative and trying to find good ways of having families still have healing experiences as they go through the experience of death,\ " Root said. 
  Alberta health officials and doctors continue to work behind the scenes to prepare for any potential cases of COVID-19, the name scientists have given to the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta. But a spike in international cases — mostly in China — has pushed the number of people confirmed to have COVID-19 above 59,000. The death toll now sits at more than 1,300 worldwide. At the Crowfoot Village Family Practice in northwest Calgary, posters featuring red stop signs warn patients who have a new cough and are feeling sick to don a mask for the duration of their visit. Boxes of surgical masks can be found on the counter at the reception desk. Signs reminding patients to put on a mask if they have a cough and are feeling sick are posted at the Crowfoot Village Family Practice. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Staff have been given a refresher on infection control, and the supply room is stocked with supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer and isolation protection kits. The kits include gowns, masks and other disposable equipment. \"For us, this is not unlike how we get ready for regular flu season,\" said the clinic's medical director and family doctor, Dr. Janet Reynolds. She has been monitoring regular updates on COVID-19 from various organizations, including Alberta Health Services. \"If patients come in with a fever, cough, cold, we ask them to put a mask on when they come to reception and try to put them directly into an exam room so that they're not potentially spreading their infection to other vulnerable patients.\" Patients who have a cough and are feeling unwell are asked to wear a mask for the duration of their appointment. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) A key difference, though, is staff are asking about a  patient's travel history, since that is one of the criteria that would trigger concerns about potential exposure to the novel coronavirus. According to Reynolds, while they've received phone calls from people — who have either travelled to China or have been exposed to someone who has and are worried about COVID-19 — they have yet to see any patients in the office with symptoms and a travel history warranting testing. She says people who call in and are feeling unwell are encouraged to stay home. In some cases, they're being prompted to call Health Link, the province's health advice and information line (dial 811). 811 calls coming in In the past week , Health Link has received an average 40-50 calls per day related to the novel coronavirus, out of a daily total ranging from 1,800 to 2,000 calls. The latest numbers released by Alberta Health, updated on Feb. 7, show 28 Albertans have been tested for the illness and all tests have come back negative. \"I think we're at a really critical point right now, globally, and I think that is relevant to Alberta,\" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.   Supplies of masks, gloves and isolation gowns at Crowfoot Village Family Practice. The clinic's medical director says they've had no trouble obtaining supplies. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) According to Hinshaw, the risk to Alberta continues to be low and the next few weeks will be pivotal in terms of containing the illness. \"I think it's too early to declare it one way or another. But again, the current risk in Alberta remains low. … We continue to do a lot of work on screening people and supporting people who are staying home, and also if there are people who are symptomatic, making sure that they get appropriate testing and advice,\ " she said. Work is going on behind the scenes to prepare for any cases that may show up in this province. Hinshaw says there are stockpiles of medical supplies that can be moved around the province as needed. \"At the moment, it's business as usual on the front lines and in the background making sure that there are extra supplies if we should need them.\ " In January, the province worked to secure extra supplies including surgical masks and specialized N95 respirator masks that are required for procedures where there is a risk that tiny droplets containing the virus could become airborne. That includes CPR,  intubation (where a tube is inserted to help a person breathe) and the use of nebulizers, which give a patient medication in the form of a mist through a mask. \"There was an extra order put in for additional personal protective equipment just in case it's needed — just out of an abundance of caution,\ " she said.   The clinic has medical supplies, including infection prevention kits, in the event that potential cases of the novel coronavirus show up. (Jennifer Lee/CBC) Alberta  Health says that order was placed early in an effort to avoid any potential shortages and it has already been received.  But officials won't speculate on how long those supplies could last or how many people could be treated with the additional stock. In an email to CBC News, a government spokesperson said \"it would depend on a wide range of factors. However, health officials continually evaluate and assess the province's stockpile of medical supplies and equipment, and will continue to do so. …  While we're acting out of an abundance of caution, we do not expect that extra supplies will be needed in the immediate future.\" Front-line health staff have also been given detailed instructions and updates on how to use infection control equipment and what type of equipment is required and when. 
  Marie-Michèle Plante unloads boxes of disposable gloves and N95 masks from her trunk and drops them onto the pavement in front of Notre-Dame Hospital in Montreal. The nurse, on a break from her work in Quebec's far north, scrounged up the supplies from people and places in her community: a nearby dépanneur, friends who work in construction — even her tattoo artist. \"It's to help my colleagues who are on the front lines,\ " she said. \"I know that in some places they don't even have protective gloves anymore.\ " There's a looming shortage of personal protective equipment in Quebec, where as of Friday, 61 people have died and 6,101 have tested positive for COVID-19. Premier François Legault said Friday Quebec only has eight days' worth of essential gear like gloves, gowns and masks, which are being used by the hundreds of thousands every day. Give Protection (in French, Donnez la protection) has stepped in to try and partially fill that void, by helping track down equipment sitting unused in other sectors, by dentists, laboratories and construction companies. Right now, 39 locations are listed as being in need, from the Hôpital de Sept-Îles on Quebec's North Shore, to the CLSC de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield in southwestern Quebec. Not surprisingly, most of the needs right now are clustered in and around Montreal, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Quebec. Jewish General Hospital donating protective gear to others in health network Matchmaking the haves and have-nots The initiative was launched March 29 by Kara Sheppard-Jones, whose partner is an internal medicine resident at the Université de Montréal. It was inspired by similar PPE drives in British Columbia and the United States. Sheppard-Jones said an early supporter of the drive was Montreal dentist Yux Mei, who was looking to donate thousands of surgical masks from his three clinics. \"The response has been great since the beginning,\" Sheppard-Jones said. \"We've been able to donate about 10,000 surgical masks and quite a few gloves.\" Those who have items to donate can go to the group's website and fill out a form describing what they have to give. The site doesn't take DIY or homemade items, but it does accept open boxes. The site is also set up to field requests from facilities or medical professionals who need supplies. Their information remains confidential, but their institution is added to an online map. Plante donated thousands of protective gloves and around 300 N95 face masks she had gathered from those in her entourage. (Simon Nakonechny/CBC)   Give Protection's volunteers then match up the donations with those who need the supplies. The volunteers also sometimes pick up and drop off the goods. \"Our goal is to make sure the highest-priority hospitals daily get what they've asked for,\" said Sheppard-Jones. Supplies must be carefully inspected One clinic that is benefiting from the service is the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex, a super-clinic in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. Dr. Mark Roper says while the clinic isn't specifically designated to handle COVID-19 cases, he estimates five to 10 per cent of their patients are COVID-positive. \"We're already getting some masks, and we're very appreciative,\ " said Roper. The doctor said they carefully inspect any donated gear to make sure it meets safety standards, but if it's coming from a dental clinic, it should be as good as what they normally use. 3M faces pressure from Trump order to stop exporting N95 masks to Canada 'They're missing the essentials' Back at Notre-Dame Hospital, Valérie Wax, a volunteer for Give Protection, waits outside to receive the supplies Plante has put together. Earlier, Wax delivered about 50 masks in a GAP Kids bag to one of the hospital's physicians. Wax gets out of her vehicle and starts loading the precious cargo into her hatchback. Some of the N95 masks will be going to Verdun Hospital, which is dealing with an COVID-19 outbreak. Valérie Wax is helping pick up and drop off masks and gloves for Give Protection.   (Simon Nakonechny/CBC) Wax says she's doing the deliveries to be a good citizen and to show solidarity with those in the medical profession. \"What's crazy is they're missing the essentials,\ " she said, \"So let's do our best, as quickly as possible, to help everyone.\"
  Doctors in Prince Rupert are urging residents to don homemade, fabric face masks to prevent the spread of COVID in a community with just two ventilators. Nineteen North Coast physicians signed an open letter that  \"strongly encourages\" residents to cover their face with cloth whenever they go out in public, in order to protect others from their respiratory droplets. \"The mask is to protect somebody from you, not the other way around,\" Dr. Johannes Piek, a GP anesthetist at the Prince Rupert Hospital, told CBC News. \"Out of respect, wear a mask to protect everyone around you. It might make a difference.\" The medical advice from the northern doctors was issued late last week, several days before Canada''s top doctor softened her opposition to the public use of masks. Now, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says that wearing a non-medical mask can help stop the spread of COVID-19, when used with other measures like handwashing and distancing.   Health officials shift policy on masks That  represents an about-face for the public health officer — who until now had resisted the idea of non-health care professionals wearing masks.   British Columbia's provincial health officer stopped short of a blanket recommendation but conceded non-medical use of masks for those who aren't sick might be useful in certain situations, like in a grocery store or on public transit where it's difficult to practise physical distancing. A community effort is underway in Prince Rupert to produce fabric masks for local use, like this one worn by Whitehorse resident Sydney Wolf.   (Submitted by Sydney Wolf) Doctors in Prince Rupert say health officials should be encouraging Canadians to wear masks. They say their recommendation follows the lead of Asian countries where people wear masks and infections have slowed. \"My mask protects you. Your mask protects me,\ " said the physicians in their statement. ' My mask protects you' For weeks, the Prince Rupert doctors  have been advocating for tougher local measures to prevent COVID-19. They say an outbreak in their community could be a disaster.   \"We have only two functioning ventilators in the hospital and ... it is impossible to underestimate the enormity of a potential major outbreak.,\" Piek  said last month.   Meanwhile, a community effort is underway in Prince Rupert to produce fabric masks for local use. Medical professionals have vetted the design and the hospital is sanitizing the fabric.  
  When travel restrictions lift post COVID-19, people should expect to see more passengers wearing masks and fewer full flights, some travel agents on P.E.I. say.   George Stewart, owner of Travels by George, says when people start travelling for leisure again, airlines and airports are going to have to come up with new ways to keep everyone healthy, and reassure the public it is safe to travel.    This might include taking passengers' temperatures, not offering food or beverages in flight and making face masks mandatory for everyone.   \"It's not as simple as you know, just starting it up and off we go again,\ " said Stewart.   \"There's never going to be a normal again. When it finally does open, it's going to be a lot of testing the waters, and a lot of pretty empty planes.\" George Stewart, owner of Travels by George in Kinkora, says when people start travelling for leisure again, airlines and airports will have to come up with new ways to reassure the public it is safe.     (Submitted: George Stewart) Stewart believes it could be spring 2021 before international travel resumes as it did prior to the pandemic — and several months still before domestic travel resumes. He said there are fears a second wave of coronavirus could hit Canada this fall alongside the start of flu season. If that happens, it would likely also affect both prices and availability of flights, he said. \"Even if it's the regular flu, you don't know whether it's COVID-19, so you're still going to have to stay at home for two weeks. With the flu season, the worst of everything kind of all converges at once.\" Expect fares to drop briefly Paulette Soloman, owner of The Travel Store — an agency with outlets across Atlantic Canada — expects that when travel restrictions initially begin to lift, airlines will offer some low airfares to get things moving again. But she said she believes fares will rise again quickly as demand increases alongside fewer flights and fewer seats available than usual. Travel Store Owner Paulette Soloman says she believes airlines might initially offer low fares entice passengers to fly again, but expects those will not last long.   (Nancy Waugh/CBC) \"We have to remember that pretty much every travel-related business worldwide is losing money right now,\" said Soloman.   \"They won't have the cash reserves for the long term to be able to deep discount. So we might see some good pricing to start, but I think in the longer term, prices will probably come back to what we would think as more of a normal price range.\ " Soloman said that travel agents, who normally make a living by earning commission from their bookings, are now mostly cancelling and rebooking trips — so they have little to no money coming in.   \"It's having a very serious impact, and that certainly impacts our sustainability,\" said Soloman. Another factor in pricing and availability will be which businesses survive the pandemic, and which do not, she added. \"That would be the same for many travel-related businesses.\ " She said for small agencies like hers, federal and provincial government relief programs will be vital for survival.   Soloman said that once travel restrictions are lifted, agents will be busy helping those who had to cancel planned trips in recent months, leaving them with travel vouchers to use in the next two years. Changes in discretionary income due to the effects of COVID-19 will make planning travel for leisure a challenge for some, she said, but she's confident that those who are still able to travel will start booking again as soon as they feel it is safe to do so.   \"I think we all have a new-found appreciation for the freedom and ability to get out there and explore the world,\" said Soloman. \"I think that's going to create some pent-up demand — the big question though is when can that start?\ " COVID-19: What you need to know What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Common symptoms include:  Fever. Cough. Tiredness.   But more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, which can lead to death. Health Canada has built a self-assessment tool. What should I do if I feel sick? Isolate yourself and call 811. Do not visit an emergency room or urgent care centre to get tested. A health professional at 811 will give you advice and instructions. How can I protect myself?   Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Clean regularly touched surfaces regularly. Practise physical distancing.   More detailed information on the outbreak is available on the federal government's website.

  A total of 115 people have died of COVID-19 in Toronto, the city's medical officer of health said on Tuesday. On Monday, Dr. Eileen de Villa had reported 92 deaths linked to the spread of novel coronavirus. As of 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, De Villa said the city had 2,543 cases of the virus. Of this number, 2,257 are confirmed, while 286 are probable.   De Villa said 223 people are in hospital with 90 in intensive care units. Sixty-eight of the deaths have occurred in the city's long-term care homes. There has been one death in a retirement home. There are 38 outbreaks in long-term care homes and 14 in retirement homes in Toronto. COVID-19 spreading among Toronto's homeless, with 30 cases reported One of those outbreaks is at the Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke. The facility confirmed Monday evening that 25 of its patients had died. On Tuesday, Eatonville announced that number had risen to 27. Medical officer extends condolences to families De Villa expressed condolences to families that have lost loved ones to COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes. \"I'm truly concerned about the devastating impacts of COVID-19 that we are seeing at our long-term care homes and these are affecting our loved ones in the community,\ " she said. But she added: \"While I completely appreciate the desire to know details about individual cases, our focus needs to be on managing our local outbreak response and protecting the privacy of these individual and their families during this difficult time.\" De Villa said Toronto Public Health (TPH) has no plans to provide detailed data on cases per facility right now. \"These numbers are constantly changing as situations evolve, often many times daily,\" she said. TPH has been working with long-term care and retirement homes to implement infection prevention and outbreak measures, she said.  These include:   Initiating twice a day screening of residents and staff to monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and catch new infections as early as possible. Implementing physical distancing measures and cancelling all group activities. Enhancing cleaning particularly for frequently touched surfaces. Ensuring that personal protective equipment is used appropriately to minimize health risks.   De Villa noted that staff members working at any of the city's 10 long-term care homes run have been asked to choose the city as their primary employer and that will help to reduce the risk of exposure facing residents and staff in city-run homes. To make it an easier choice for employees, the city has offered additional hours of work and overtime, she said. \"The staff working in long-term care homes are critical to keeping our loved ones safe. To do this they need to stay healthy. We need to protect them and our best line of defence is to reduce community transmission: stay at home as much as possible and, when you do go out, practise physical distancing,\ " she added. A new emergency order to be issued by the province on Tuesday will make it mandatory that staff only work at one facility to limit the spread of the virus among vulnerable seniors.   De Villa, along with Mayor John Tory and Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, head of the city's emergency response team, spoke at a news conference at city hall. New website created to help small businesses The mayor, for his part, said the city is trying to draw attention to the creation of a new online donation platform, Distantly.ca, designed to help small businesses suffering massive losses. Tory said the city is fully supportive of the grassroots initiative, which he called a \"free, secure, community crowdfunding tool.\" Mayor John Tory admitted on Tuesday: 'One of my greatest fears is that Toronto comes through this crisis and sees its main street businesses decimated and our streets devoid of the activity that make our city's life, in normal times, so exciting and so fulfilling.' (Michael Charles Cole/CBC) The platform was developed through a partnership of the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA), a non-profit umbrella organization working with 83 Business Improvement Areas that represent more than 40,000 business and property owners, and Digital Main Street, an initiative that helps businesses launch an online presence. Other partners included David McArthur, Enterprise, Totum Life Science, and Migeotte. Tory said the platform will allow community members to donate to their favourite small businesses securely, using a directory, to help lessen the impact of the crisis. He said residents can support main street businesses, such as coffee shops, restaurants and hair salons, that have been forced to close or cut back operations because they have been deemed non-essential. The mayor said the donations will help businesses with such expenses as rent and payroll. \"One of my greatest fears is that Toronto comes through this crisis and sees its main street businesses decimated and our streets devoid of the activity that make our city's life, in normal times, so exciting and so fulfilling. And of course, these main streets, and all of that activity, keep the city healthy at the same time,\" he said. \"With this in mind, city staff are working on developing a range of solutions with partners in the community, while also continuing to advocate for additional support from the provincial and federal governments to ensure we don't lose our small-business community.\" Local businesses can visit the website to set up a free account and contact their local Business Improvement Association for help. The idea for the online donation platform, founded by Susan McArthur, a former partner at a venture capital fund, and Daniel Spataro and Moe Katib, co-founders of Buildable Technologies, came after Tory asked local companies at a TechTO event to provide ideas to help the city respond to the outbreak. \"We need more ideas like this,\ " Tory added. City takes inventory of existing PPE Pegg, meanwhile, said the city is committed to ensuring front-line staff, including emergency responders, those working with people experiencing homelessness, and staff in long-term care homes, have the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to stay safe and protect the city's health. Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, head of the city's emergency response team, says the personal protective equipment used most by city staff in the fight against COVID-19 are surgical masks, N95 respirators, isolation gowns, face shields and medical gloves. (CBC) Pegg said PPE used the most by city staff in the fight against COVID-19 are surgical masks, N95 respirators, isolation gowns, face shields and medical gloves. Respirators are used primarily by first responders, while other PPE is used largely in support of shelter and long-term care home operations, he said. Currently, the city's PPE inventory is:  N-95 respirators: the city has 107 days of inventory at today's consumption rate, 33 days at worst-case scenario consumption. Surgical masks: the city has 52 days of inventory at today's consumption rate, 25 days at worst-case scenario consumption. Isolation gowns: the city has 51 days of inventory at today's consumption rate, 18 days at worst-case scenario consumption. Face shields: the city has 26 days of inventory at today's consumption rate, 8 days at worst-case scenario consumption. Surgical gloves: constant inventory available.   In a worst-case scenario, there would be full-blown COVID-19 outbreaks at every city-run shelter and long-term care home and there would be significant community transmission, he added. \"The availability of quality PPE continues to be a very real global challenge. And we are continuing to work with our provincial partners to ensure our PPE needs continue to be met,\ " Pegg said. 
  Canada's response to the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak is winning unusual praise in China — a development that federal government sources here say is part of a broader re-engagement strategy aimed at repairing strained relations between the two countries. News reports in Chinese state-run media, official government statements and messages posted by Chinese citizens online all suggest a warming trend in the Canada-China relationship — a relationship that's been very tense since the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in 2018. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi applauded Canada for responding to China's request for medical equipment, such as face masks and protective gear. \"On behalf of the people of China, we extend our appreciations. Thank you,\ " Wang told his Canadian counterpart François-Philippe Champagne at the Munich Security Conference. \"This is a special relationship.\" His remarks mark a notable shift in tone since January by the ruling Communist Party, and it's all the more remarkable given the overt animosity in the bilateral relationship over the past 14 months. Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained by Chinese officials just days after Meng's arrest; their detention is widely viewed as an act of retaliation for the arrest of the telecommunications executive on an extradition request from the United States. Another Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, was given a death sentence in January 2019 after having been previously sentenced to prison for drug smuggling. China also has blocked imports of Canadian agricultural products. Government sources in this country tell CBC News that the so-called public health diplomacy by Canada has resulted in a new climate of diplomatic détente — and that relations with China are better now than they have been since at least 2018. Canada has sent 16 tonnes of personal protective equipment, such as clothing, face shields, masks, goggles and gloves, to China since February 4, 2020. (Global Affairs Canada) The coronavirus outbreak seems to be driving the sudden thaw. Canada needed Chinese approval to send a plane to the Chinese city of Wuhan to collect Canadians there who asked for help to leave. China, meanwhile, needed the international community's help to grapple with the outbreak. Global Affairs Canada said it had shipped about 16 tonnes of personal protective equipment to China this month, including clothing, face shields, masks, goggles and gloves. Ottawa also agreed to provide $2 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to help vulnerable countries prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak beyond China. Canada ready to help China contain coronavirus if it asks: PM Renowned Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward recently made his way to China to lead a team of WHO experts to study the origin of the virus and the severity of the disease. Canadian doctor, WHO team heading to China, where coronavirus death toll tops 900Who's the Canadian leading WHO's coronavirus investigation in China? \"This is Canada. And when in (times of) need, we want to be there and be able to provide assistance to the extent we can,\ " Champagne said this week. That assistance, sources said, presented new opportunities for Ottawa to start repairing its relationship with China. \"We are engaging with each other. I think every time you have a chance to have a dialogue it's something positive,\ " said Champagne, who added he raises the plight of the Canadian detainees in every discussion with Chinese officials. Friday's meeting marked the second time in two weeks the Canadian and Chinese foreign affairs ministers spoke with each other. Canada and China didn't have a single ministerial-level meeting for eight months following Meng's arrest. The embassy's charm offensive Despite Canada's decision to scale down its consular operations in China as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Canadian embassy in Beijing has been ramping up its outreach efforts on social media. More than 2.3 million people follow the embassy's page on Weibo, China's most popular social media platform. One widely-shared post from the embassy this month showed a photo of Canadian aid headed for Wuhan. Another cited Canada's decision not to impose a travel ban on people coming from China. The U.S., Australia and some European nations have enacted strict border controls, banning the entry of foreigners who travelled to China in the past 14 days. Canada says its approach is in line with the World Health Organization's guidelines related to \"inappropriate restrictions to travel and trade.\" Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, sends a message of support to the people of China on the Weibo page of the Canadian embassy in Beijing. (The Embassy of Canada to China/Weibo) Canada's newly-appointed Ambassador to China Dominic Barton delivered one recent embassy video message in Mandarin, urging the citizens of Wuhan to \"stay strong.\" On Weibo, Chinese citizens praised Canada's actions.  \"China -Canada friendship lasts forever!\" wrote one. \"Thank you! We will never forget the people who helped us when our country was in trouble,\" says another online comment. Those responses are a far cry from the comments the embassy's Weibo page was getting just a month ago, when many Chinese were using it as a platform to vent their feelings about Canada's troubled relations with China. An anchor on China's state-owned television broadcaster CCTV delivers a story about Canada's help in combating the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. (CCTV) Canada's recent efforts have also attracted glowing headlines in state-owned media, and even in official Beijing. \"Our heartfelt thanks go to Canada for its support and assistance in China's fight against the epidemic,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a briefing this week. Wenran Jiang, an adjunct professor at the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, said that Canada's recent efforts have been \"extremely well received\" in China. \"I think Chinese people – even Chinese officials – will probably have a second look on whether in the past year-plus they have been treating Canada too harsh, whether [they] should probably reconsider the [Kovrig and Spavor] cases,\ " Jiang predicted. More than 1,700 Chinese health workers infected while fighting coronavirus outbreakAnalysis'Punishment' or procedure? Pessimism lingers over efforts to lift China's canola banWhat you need to know now about the coronavirus: International investigation begins this weekend No one is suggesting the more complex outstanding issues between Canada and China will be easily repaired, or that Spavor and Kovrig will be freed tomorrow. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took an optimistic line this week. \"Yes, we are having challenges with China,\ " Trudeau said Friday in Munich, Germany, where he was attending an international security conference. \"In this recent coronavirus challenge and issue, Canada has been there to send medical supplies to China, to be supportive, to work with them and the WHO, to try and help where we can in resolving this. \"So just because you have a serious disagreement on an issue that may be extremely important to you and to Canadians, it can't prevent you from continuing to talk and try to solve other things at the same time.

Your questions have surprised us, stumped us and got us thinking, including a number of questions about food and groceries from Canadians concerned about contamination, including this question from Carol H.   Do I need to wipe down surfaces on delivered items and groceries? What cleaning products should be used for each? How should I clean fresh fruits and vegetables? According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, there are no reported cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of COVID-19. But a recent study suggests the virus can persist on surfaces, such as cardboard.   Based on the results of this study, here's just how long the virus can last on various surfaces:   Plastic or stainless steel for two to three days.    Cardboard for 24 hours.    Copper for four hours.    However, the study found the amount of virus that is found on the surfaces might not be enough to get infected and further research is needed.   As for packaged items from the grocery store, epidemiologist Dr. Rama Nair suggests rinsing them with soap and water if possible, or at least a disinfectant wipe approved for use against coronavirus. Nair adds that fresh fruits and vegetables should be rinsed as soon as they are brought into your home. \"We don't have enough data to know how long it can stay on the food; it will depend on many factors. Therefore, as a precaution it is better to wash ... since we know washing with soap and water destroys the virus,\ " he said. If you choose to disinfect your deliveries, use soap and water, and wash your hands after unpacking your items. For other options, read more here to help you decide what works best for you!

A lot of questions from Canadians were about outdoor time, including this one from Bob and Dee F. who are self-isolating after travelling, but want to get outside for a little exercise. So what's OK?   Health Minister Patty Hajdu says Canadians returning from other countries must take self-isolation seriously, instructing people to \"rest in your house for 14 days, no exceptions.\ " That means no walks, unless you have a big backyard with a fence.

Is COVID-19 harmful to either the mother or baby in pregnancy? Are pregnant women an at-risk population? Jamie T. wonders whether pregnant women need to self-isolate to protect themselves. Based on early clinical trials, there is no evidence to suggest transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her fetus. While there have been reported cases of newborns with the virus, it's likely those were a result of intimate contact with an infected mother.   CBC News Network Host Aarti Pole recently spoke with Dr. Jon Barrett, head of maternal fetal medicine at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, who says that \"pregnant women are not more at risk\" than other members of the population. Though he adds, \"we're getting new data all the time, so it could change.\" However, there are currently no special precautions for expectant mothers outside of the guidelines for the general population.   Women in their third trimester who are close to delivery should also consult with their health-care provider to get the latest information about their hospital's labour and delivery guidelines and protocol as those policies evolve. Who qualifies for help with their rent or mortgage? A number of Canadians want to know if there's help for homeowners and renters.

  Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is bracing for the arrival of coronavirus, but so far no cases have been reported in this city. Health officials have identified a second presumptive case in Toronto after the wife of a man believed to be Ontario's first presumptive case of the virus began showing similar symptoms. Officials say the woman has been in \"self-isolation\" since arriving in Toronto, while her husband remains in stable condition in hospital.   2nd presumptive case of coronavirus confirmed in Ontario   Officials continue to identify people who may have come into contact with the couple on their flight from China, but OPH says it hasn't been informed of any in Ottawa. According to Ottawa's medical officer of health, health officials here are already taking precautions. \"When people present with a respiratory illness ... they are screened for their travel history, especially considering any contact with the Wuhan city or provinces nearby in China, any contact with ill people who have been in Wuhan,\" Dr. Vera Etches told CBC.   Chinese New Year event in Ottawa cancelled as coronavirus concern spreads   \"People are getting the message: when they return from a country or area that is affected, to monitor themselves for symptoms of a respiratory infection.\"  Symptoms includes fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath, Etches said. No tests ordered in Ottawa Etches told CBC anyone who believes they may have been exposed to coronavirus and is showing symptoms should phone ahead before arriving at the emergency room. However, Ottawa Public Health later countered that advice and said patients do not have to call ahead. \"There is no need to contact health-care providers in advance of going to the hospital,\ " Ottawa Public Health spokesperson Nikki Hudson said in an email. Residents can simply notify the hospital of their symptoms when they arrive, she said. \"We'll walk them through the process … if it looks like they should be tested for the new coronavirus,\ " Etches said. So far, no tests have been ordered in Ottawa. Dr. Vera Etches is Ottawa's medical officer of health.   (Matthew Kupfer/CBC) \"Right now, this is very low-risk still for transmission of this new virus in Canada. So, it's very unlikely that someone would come in contact with the virus here,\ " she said. Nevertheless, Etches cautions people to wash their hands frequently, and to refrain from touching their eyes and nose. Viruses are often contracted by coming into contact with mucous membranes. Masks unnecessary There have been reports of people in Ottawa buying up medical masks, likely to ship to family in China, but according to Etches, \"here in Ottawa, there is no reason to wear a mask if you're well.\ " Wearing a mask likely won't prevent a healthy person from getting sick anyway, Etches said. \"They're not fitted. Air can get around them. People touch them, they touch their eyes, the environment. It gives a false sense of security. So really, the main thing is, keep your hands clean.\ "  Etches also urges people to check reputable sources, such as the Ottawa Public Health website, for up-to-date information on coronavirus. 
  One of Winnipeg's newest grocers is going above and beyond in efforts to keep people safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking the temperatures of both its staff and customers.   Before you can enter Seafood City — a Filipino supermarket chain which recently opened a location in the Garden City area — customers first have to have their temperature taken with a thermometer gun.   Rowell Bernardo, operations head for the Canada division of Seafood City, said the supermarket wanted to do everything it could to give customers a safe shopping experience, and help its workers stay healthy. \"We really care about the community and we care about our customers, and especially we care about our employees,\ " he said.   A sign informing customers that their temperature will be taken before entering Seafood City.

That's the temperature at which the Centres for Disease Control says someone is considered to have a fever — one of the symptoms of COVID-19. The store is also taking the temperature of employees before they start their shift.   In addition, the store has a new code to remind employees to practise safety measures. When employees hear the code \"activate 88\" announced over the store's intercom, they have to change their gloves and  wash their hands. (The code was chosen at random as something simple employees could quickly recognize.)

Truckers hauling freight, health professionals and others who live on one side and work on the other are still allowed to cross. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press) Border restrictions are in place, preventing \"non-essential\" travel between Canada and the United States — the global epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the two countries are enforcing those restrictions in very different ways, with the United States only banning non-essential travel across the border at land crossings and by ferry. Canada has banned all non-essential travel, regardless of the mode of transportation. Read more about the Canada-U.S. border restrictions. All international travel from Canada has been limited as well. Air Canada and WestJet have cancelled most of their international flights, Canada has barred all travellers who are not citizens or permanent residents, and Health Minister Patty Hajdu said returning Canadian travellers must enter a mandatory 14-day period of isolation under the Quarantine Act.   Air Canada announced it would lay off 16,500 employees due to flight cancellations and reduced demand. Travel throughout the world has reduced dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic.   (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) She said she would consider criminal penalties for those travellers who don't self-isolate at home for at least 14 days to reduce community spread. And of those travellers still stuck abroad, 525 so far have been given loans by the Canadian government to pay for hotels and book flights. The federal government has given a total of $1.8 million so far, and a further 800 applications for the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad are still being processed.

Do I have COVID-19, the flu or a cold? Depending on the severity of the illness, COVID-19 can present with a variety of different symptoms — or no symptoms at all. Some mimic the flu or common cold, while the World Health Organization said they have begun to investigate whether a loss of smell and taste could be a telltale marker of the disease. With all of these different possibilities, if you feel sick, when should you get tested?   Some basic facts about the virus, its symptoms, prevention and what to do if you believe you are infected can be found here.  There are also ongoing studies into whether a loss of smell and taste could be a symptom of COVID-19, which you can read about here.

But when the virus attacks lung cells, shortness of breath ensues, says family physician Dr. Peter Lin. 0:27 How deadly is COVID-19? COVID-19's fatality rate is one of the biggest unanswered questions around the disease. Between different countries, drastically different ratios have been reported — from 0.5 to 10 per cent of those infected dying in some regions. Some experts see Germany's low death rate, for one, as a temporary run of good luck, while Italy's relatively high elderly population could be contributing to their numbers. Read more about why fatality rates are different in every country. Meanwhile, doctors are warning young people that they are not immune to the disease.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19, the first step is to contact your health-care provider or local public health agency by email or telephone. They'll be able to tell you if you're eligible for testing in your area. Some communities have even launched drive-thru testing sites. In Victoria, nurses are screening residents for COVID-19 at a drive-thru testing clinic which was recently launched by Island Health along Cook Street. (Chad Hipolito/The Canadian Press) Most provinces and territories are limiting testing so that there will be enough for the highest priority patients, including health-care workers. Do not show up unannounced at a clinic or hospital. However, if you have a sharp turn in your condition, including shortness of breath, call 911 or your local emergency number.  Read our guide to what to do in each province and territory. The importance of staying home As coronavirus cases continue to rise, Canadians are explicitly being told to stay home to protect their health and the health of everyone in their communities. Ontario is prohibiting gatherings of more than five people. Reinforcing the government's message of physical distancing, Gov. Gen. Julie Payette issued a statement March 25, reminding Canadians to \"resist the temptation to visit friends and neighbours.\" Such measures are taking on increasing importance.

(Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press) Masks are already in such short supply, even for health care workers, that it has prompted global competition between countries to secure their own stocks What you need to know about masks Despite older statements advising those without symptoms to refrain from wearing masks, Canada's top doctor now says even non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam made the announcement on Monday, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) had a similar about-face over the weekend.

Could I still have coronavirus?   Probably not, but there is some evidence that people can get infected with this virus and not show any symptoms. As well, there is mounting evidence that those who are asymptomatic coronavirus carriers are playing a key part in spreading the virus around the globe. Both Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam have downplayed the idea that so called \"silent spreaders\" are a common way people are infected. A hospital worker is seen at a staff COVID-19 assessment area outside Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver on Wednesday, March 18. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press) But a growing body of research indicates they may be wrong and people don't have to appear ill at all to infect others. Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University in New York, says he is frustrated when people deny that asymptomatic spread can happen. \"We have so much evidence that that is going on,\ " he said. \"It's ridiculous.\" Read more about \"silent spreaders\" here. What happens if there is an outbreak in a nursing home?   Nursing homes across the world have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, and Canada is no different. At the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon, Ont., 20 residents had died as of April 3 from the disease. In other parts of the country, families are being advised against hospitalizing their elderly relatives who contract the disease. One nursing home sent out a letter to the family of a long-term care facility resident, saying that the home had no plans to transport residents who became ill with COVID-19 to the hospital.   \"Doctors have learned there is no benefit for seniors with COVID-19 to go to the hospital, and they would not survive intensive care,\" the letter read. At the same time, caregivers have been risking their lives to look after the elderly — at Pinecrest, a spouse of someone who volunteered at the centre died, and 24 staff members were infected.

A 17-year-old dog in Hong Kong originally tested positive for the coronavirus, but was later cleared.   On March 18, it was announced that the dog, which belonged to a patient with COVID-19, had died. Vets in Hong Kong say the stress and anxiety of being in quarantine while under examination may have been a contributing factor. Some have expressed fear over whether the virus can survive on fur. Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist in Edmonton, says it's possible, but only if there's a substantial amount of the virus on the hands of the pet owner.   \"We wouldn't expect that much virus to transfer from fur, so beyond usual precautions I wouldn't worry about it,\" she says.

The federal government has asked some telecommunications companies to send text messages to Canadians who are still outside of Canada to help get in touch with them.   A number of telecommunications service providers have agreed to a Government of Canada request to send text messages containing contact information for Global Affairs Canada consular support to devices belonging to Canadians living or travelling abroad. <a href=\"https://t.co/ALBLkuzODd\">https://t.co/ALBLkuzODd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QpqVeze3jf\">pic.twitter.com/QpqVeze3jf</a>&mdash;@NavdeepSBains
  People in Waterloo region, along with people across the province, are being told to avoid gathering in groups of five or more. The province announced the new order Saturday night as a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There have been 69 confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo region, although, acting medical officer of health Hsiu-Li Wang has said public health is not testing everyone. Currently, healthcare workers and hospital patients are the priority when it comes to COVID-19 testing. As of Sunday morning, 11 people were in hospital. There is also one case that has since been marked as resolved, meaning the patient has received two negative tests in a row for COVID-19 after previously having had the virus.   Region of Waterloo Public Health is expected to give its next update on Monday morning. Universities, college donate supplies Waterloo region's universities and college are donating items to local hospitals to help healthcare workers deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The science faculty at the University of Waterloo went through classrooms and labs to find personal protective equipment to donate to local hospitals. \"While we may be facing uncertain times, it's uplifting to see some of the efforts being made to help out across campus,\ " a person said on the @WaterlooSci Twitter account.   Conestoga College also gathered equipment to donate including N95 masks, gloves and protective equipment.   The college also has ventilators, beds, stretchers, mattresses and other equipment they use for students to learn hands-on skills that will be donated.   Ayr-based company Stage Door Transportation has offered to move the equipment for the college, the school said. Conestoga president John Tibbits said in a release that the school is happy to be \"sharing our resources to protect front-line workers and provide additional capacity for hospitals.\ "  The University of Guelph is also going through labs to find equipment to donate. The school recently delivered 10,000 N95 masks to Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. The school says it's also collecting disinfectant wipes, nitrile gloves, hand sanitizer, surgical masks and isolation gowns while the Ontario Veterinary College will donate ventilator equipment.

  Dentists across Manitoba are preparing for the \"new normal\ " — wearing N95 masks and face shields, and only seeing a limited number of patients with urgent needs.   Starting Monday, dental offices will be able to be reopen under the plan announced by the province Wednesday to allow some services and businesses put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic to restart. Dentists who do reopen, though, must follow new provincial guidelines meant to protect staff and patients from getting COVID-19. The measures include screening patients for any COVID-19 symptoms before appointments, implementing physical distancing strategies in waiting rooms, and having everyone use hand sanitizer once inside. Hair salons, dentists, patios can reopen in Manitoba starting MondayMasks, gloves and distancing: What to expect from a hair cut or massage next week \"We recognize that a lot of Manitobans have been waiting patiently to have their dental care needs managed and dentists want to get to their urgent issues first,\" said Dr. Marc Mollot, president of the Manitoba Dental Association. \"The analogy I would use would be … more like a dimmer switch on a light, rather than a light switch,\ " he said, with dental services gradually phased in. The association is telling dentists to wear personal protective equipment, including masks, eye protection, gloves, booties and gowns — gear he says is in short supply right now, in part because dentists donated it to front-line workers early on in the pandemic.   Dr. Marc Mollot is the president of the Manitoba Dental Association.   (CBC) Mollot said patients who are looking to see a dentist for simpler appointments like cleanings will have to wait, and won't be seen by dentists Monday.   He said anything that could cause pain or infection is considered urgent and can be dealt with when offices reopen. Dentists with smaller offices will face challenges For orthodontists, that could mean seeing a patient who has braces with a loose wire or broken bracket. \"The patients who are wearing braces are going to be a considerably higher priority than those wearing aligners, because more can go wrong with the patients that have things stuck to their teeth,\" said Dr. Bruce McFarlane, an orthodontist who runs Winnipeg Village Orthodontics in Grant Park. WATCH |  Manitoba dentists prepare for limited reopening: Manitoba dentists gear up to reopen Monday 2:06 McFarlane last saw patients in person on March 17. He's getting ready to see fewer patients than normal when he reopens, and is getting personal protective gear ready for his staff. But he said patients shouldn't feel uneasy when coming to a dental office. \"Dentists are scientists first, and we deal with infection and infected processes all day long, forever and ever.\"  McFarlane remembers when HIV first appeared. He worked through the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and is reflecting on that experience as he gears up to handle COVID-19. \"At that point , it was thought that was going to absolutely change and disrupt everything, and it did,\ " he said. In dentistry practices, though, some of those changes were for the better, he says. \"We adapted … and we continue to upgrade and adapt,\ " he said, and now, \"going to your dentist is going to be one of the safer places you can go to.\ "   Manitoba businesses scramble to meet strict rules for reopening Monday'Status quo' for open child-care facilities, but Manitoba's reopening plan offers no next steps He said patients in his office will be distanced. Only a fraction of his 11 chairs will be used and clients who need any work with water spray will be placed in an enclosed room that will then be shut down for two hours. \"I feel a little bit worse for the dentist that maybe has one or two chairs and can't be that adaptive.\" Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer, says the province is letting health professions figure out the safest way to reopen. (John Woods/Canadian Press) The guidelines for dentists from the Manitoba provincial government are less stringent than what the College of Dental Surgeons of Saskatchewan is advising as that province moves forward with reopening. The Saskatchewan college is requiring patients to have their temperature taken. If drilling is required, the college asks dentists to do the procedure in an enclosed room with a closeable door. The operating room must remain closed for two hours after to allow dust in the room to settle before the room can be cleaned. Gowns, hairnets and no small talk: Sask. dentist says patients can expect big changes Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, said Thursday the province is letting health professions decide the safest way to reopen.   \"We are easing our restrictions, but we're not directing the professions of others,\ " he said. \"We can certainly be engaged, we can certainly work with those organizations to decide on how they feel best to practise within their profession, but it wasn't for us to direct them on what procedures that they should or shouldn't take.\ " McFarlane said he is just happy to get back to work and bring back some of his employees he's  had to lay off.   \"It's been tough. I'm lucky that I have such great teams,\ " he said. \"They've been most understanding.\ "
  It's almost life as usual for the Lin family of Taiwan during the coronavirus pandemic — with a few noticeable exceptions. \"We didn't worry too much,\" said Leeli Chang, who lives with her husband, Terry Lin, and her daughter, Peggy, 8, in a suburb of Taipei. The family, like many in Taiwan, has continued to go to work, to school and out shopping as normal since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but now with some precautions in place — such as regular temperature checks and hand sanitizer dispensers outside most public buildings and protective masks. Taiwan was hit hard by the SARS pandemic in 2003, but this time, the government took swift and early actions when it first became aware of an unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China. By mid-February, the territory had increased its mask and alcoholic sanitizer production, introduced fines for raising the price of medical supplies and set cleaning standards for public transportation and other areas, such as trains and schools. Taiwanese children eat their lunch at school. They only take their masks off when the dividers are up to prevent infection. (Joyce Huang) Both Canada and Taiwan reported their first presumptive cases of coronavirus within days of each other in January, but by March, they had diverged sharply in the number of infections reported. As of March 21, there were only 153 confirmed cases and two deaths in Taiwan, an island with 23 million people that's only slightly bigger than Vancouver Island. That's far fewer than Canada's more than 1,000 confirmed cases and 12 deaths.    Sign up for CBC's Coronavirus Brief daily newsletter   It's shaping up to be a different experience for families in Taiwan compared to their Canadian counterparts. \"I think that every time we watch the news, it gives us the confidence, like, 'You don't need to worry too much,'\" said Chang when asked about whether she and her family are concerned about the virus. Leeli Chang with her daughter, Peggy Lin and husband, Terry Lin.   (CBC) In Canada, one family is trying to keep fears at bay. \"We're really working hard to keep that out of the home.\" said Louise Gleeson, when asked a similar question about her family's level of anxiety over the virus. \"As a parent, I'm really trying to stay grounded, because if I let myself go too far ahead in my thinking, I do feel the anxiety creep up.\ " Gleeson lives with her husband and four children, ages 9, 13, 15 and 17, in Oakville, Ont. How to keep kids safe in school during the pandemic The school situations in Taiwan and Canada have been very different. After an additional two weeks off during winter break, schools reopened in Taiwan. But every morning, Chang says she and her husband take their daughter's temperature and report it to her school before she goes. Their daughter, like all the kids, wears a mask all day — except at lunch. At lunch, when she takes off her mask, she is protected from infection by a plastic barrier that sits atop her desk and helps separate her from other students.   \"We have protective barriers for everyone,\" said Chang, \"During mealtime, they take it out to eat their lunch.\" 'The videos of the empty shelves, they can really just get you going and get you panicked,' said Louise Gleeson, left. She and her family live in Oakville, Ont.   (Louise Gleeson) Chang says her daughter's school was one of the first in Taipei to introduce the dividers. \"The school also teaches them how to wash their hands, every day.\" said Chang. Those measures have been in place since February, well before Canadian provinces closed schools. In Canada, kids are home from school across the country. Ontario extended its March break by two weeks, and the governments in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and British Columbia have cancelled classes indefinitely. That means finding a way to keep the children busy. For Gleeson, assigning her kids one chore a day has helped. She has them reorganizing kitchen cupboards, washing and vacuuming out the cars, and going through old piles of toys and books, choosing which ones to donate when this is all over. Once the chores are done, everyone can have some fun. \"We're staying up far too late watching movies,\ " she said. Gleeson said she feels fortunate that they have the tools they need for at-home learning, when the time comes, but hopes schools aren't closed for long. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on SundayMARKETPLACESupermarkets limit product quantities all the time. Why didn't they do so at start of pandemic? \"Having four children at various grade levels makes the school closures very daunting,\ " she said. \"I would be so glad if our students and educators could end the school year in their classrooms, but I'm not pinning my hopes on it.\" Panic buying of hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies Canadians across the country have seen surges in panic buying of masks, alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer.  It has some people questioning supply chains.   Luckily for the Gleeson family, they stocked up on everything they needed several weeks ago. \"When you have four kids in a span of seven years, which I [did] , you know how to be organized.\" she said. \"So, I was stockpiled and ready to go two, three weeks ago.\ " But while Gleeson is prepared, she worries about her elderly neighbours who may not have had the means to plan so far ahead. \"I'm not feeling any panic as far as supplies and food goes at my home, but I am feeling the panic of people out in the community and worrying about that,\ " she said. Any Canadian who's tried to buy hand sanitizer — food and toilet paper, for that matter — in the last week knows that many pharmacies and grocery store shelves have been picked clean for a while now. To help prevent people from hoarding supplies, the Taiwanese government announced jail sentences of up to seven years and fines of up to the equivalent of $200,000 Cdn for individuals or businesses who try to profit by raising prices on disease-prevention products, such as hand sanitizer. \"Initially, when people began to be aware [of the virus], there was a shortage. It was difficult buying them,\" said Dr. Mei-shang Ho, a virologist and epidemiologist from Taiwan. According to the Taipei Times, in mid-February, when alcohol-based sanitizers were running low across the territory, the government instructed two state-run manufacturers to increase their production to meet demand. Stores selling the bottles have limited the amount people can buy to one per person. Peggy Lin practices hand washing at her school. In Taiwan, schools opened after taking an additional two-week break during winter holidays, unlike in Canada where many provinces have cancelled schools indefinitely. (Joyce Huang) In Taiwan, most public buildings, such as schools, train stations, restaurants and apartment buildings, have automatic hand sanitizing dispensers outside, with signs urging people to disinfect their hands before entering. \"We try to deliver to those places that are needed, for example, schools or key government offices, to make sure that places that need it have sanitizers,\ " said Jaushieh Joseph Wu, Taiwan's minister of foreign affairs. It's a stark contrast to Canada, where pharmacies across the country are out of stock. Alcohol disinfectants aren't the only cleaning supplies in high demand in Canada right now. Many stores across the country are sold out of things like disinfectant wipes and soap.   THE LATESTCoronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 21AnalysisIs Taiwan's impressive response to COVID-19 possible in Canada? According to Chang, Taiwan has rationed the amount of cleaning supplies people can buy. \"Our government said you can buy one — only one — that you can use at home. I don't think it's a problem for us.\" she said. \"But you just need to go there and line up for a long time.\ " She joked that she sends her husband, Terry Lin, to stand in line. Taiwan has face masks \"Taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks; other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans,\" said Dr Benjamin Cowling, a professor at the school of public health at the University of Hong Kong. Taiwanese workers have screens so they can eat in isolation. (CBC) The Taiwanese government took over production of surgical masks early on, banning exportation and eventually bringing in soldiers to help with increased production. It allocated certain amounts to retailers and lowered prices to the equivalent of about 24 cents Cdn. \"Right now, we still need to go to the pharmacy to buy masks,\" said Chang. \"We take a kind of ticket, a numbered ticket, and they tell you what time you pick up the masks.\ " In early February, the government announced a mask rationing system where everyone gets a certain number of masks per week. That number per person was bumped up in early March to three per adult per week, and five per child under 13 per week. People can pick up their masks on designated days of the week, depending on their health card number. Why it's so difficult to get tested for COVID-19 in CanadaExclusivePrepare for multiple waves of COVID-19 over 12 months: military chief to troops In Canada, a shortage of masks had health care professionals sounding the alarm weeks ago. Now, some hospitals are keeping a closer eye on medical supplies, such as masks, because equipment has gone missing. This sign in a 7/11 store in Taiwan notes that these alcohol bottles are limited to one per person.   (Rowlin Huang) On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government would help businesses that already make medical supplies to increase their capacity and help other manufacturers buy equipment so they can make needed supplies such as masks, ventilators and hand sanitizers. Critics say measures like this could take months to implement, and it's not yet clear if these supplies will be for consumers or health care professionals. Dining during the pandemic In Taiwan, restaurants are open for business, and the Lin family is still able to indulge in a night out occasionally. But for the Gleeson family, those days are over — indefinitely. On March 17, the Ontario government called on all restaurants and bars to stop serving customers food and drink inside their establishments and to offer instead only takeout and delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. All nightclubs, movie theatres and concert venues were also urged to close temporarily to help stop the spread of the virus. ' I really feel like we dropped the ball' In addition to regular public service announcements broadcast and available on the internet, the Taiwanese government is also cracking down on false information. People found to be spreading fake news about the pandemic could be fined up to the equivalent of about $142,000 Cdn.   \"What we have done is working,\" said Wu. \"Taiwan's experience is a successful one.\"  Taiwan's foreign affairs minister, Joseph Wu, shown in Taipei last November, said if Canada adopts a 'whole-government approach' similar to Taiwan's when tackling COVID-19, it may fare better than some European countries. (Fabian Hamacher/Reuters) Taiwan still has relatively few COVID-19 cases compared to Canada and, according to Dr. Ho, that's because of its fast response. \"There's no magic to it,\" she said. \"It's just isolation and quarantining. I think epidemic control is like a race to see who gets the upper hand: the people or the virus.\" Got questions about physical distancing? Here's what you need to knowWhat to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory She says in Taiwan's case, they started that race a lot earlier than countries like Canada. Gleeson also doesn't feel Canada has acted fast enough. \"I really feel like we dropped the ball,\ " she said. \"It's done, but it's disappointing, and I hope we can learn some really big lessons from how other places handled this and how we did not.\" Dr. Ho agrees. \"I think it's too late to talk about, you know, what we've done,\ " she said when asked what actions Canada should adopt from Taiwan. \"But yes, you still have to quarantine, you still have to isolate your patients, etc.,\" she said. \"But, you know, across the whole environment, people's perception, it's not going to be the same. Here, we are at ease, but there, people are anxious.\ " Wu thinks it's not too late to change Canada's approach. \"For Canada, the cases are still few, so if the Canadian government takes the whole-government approach like Taiwan... then I think the Canadian government might come out less affected than those countries in Europe or even in the United States, \" he said. 
  Efforts are being made around New Brunswick to check on those who are especially vulnerable during the COVID -19 pandemic. \"I'm telling you honestly, all of the seniors are scared to death,\" said Matthew Kenney of Rexton. \"They're scared to go out. They're scared to get any company.\" Kenney has health issues and a small fixed income.   Besides the virus, he said, many seniors are worried about how they'll pay their bills, which have increased because of costs such as delivery fees. \"It just feels like we're in the middle of a great big field covered in snow screaming for help and nobody's hearing us.\" Kenney's wife ran a small home-support business, but some of her clients have asked her to stop coming. They're worried about being exposed to the coronavirus. Nathalie Arseneau of Dalhousie said many of the 250 or so clients of her home-care business in northern New Brunswick, Atlantik Quality Care, have also cancelled or cut back on their service. They want to minimize their potential exposure, she said. \"Everybody is nervous.\ " Fewer home care workers It's actually worked out for Arseneau, in terms of managing human resources, because some of her 150 employees have temporarily stopped working. \"A lot of our employees are almost 50 years old and older. … There's some that have their own health issues, so they have to stop working for their own health.\"   A few other workers have lost their daycare providers. It's \"balancing out\ " more than Arseneau expected, with part-time workers taking on more hours. Arseneau said she's confident that clients are getting the care they need but admits there is still an excess demand. In many cases, she said, family members have stepped in to help make sure their loved ones are OK. Melynda Jarratt of Fredericton said her family is in that situation.   Family members filling the gap The regular caregiver of 102-year-old Lucy Jarratt in Bathurst had to self-isolate, so Melynda and two of her siblings are staying with their mother to fill in. \"We're trying our best to keep things going,\" said Jarratt.   \"I don't know how much longer I can last up here, though. … I can't stay forever.\ "  Arseneau said the government could help address the shortage of home-care workers by boosting their wages to make it a more attractive field. Jarratt said she is more worried about elderly people who don't have family around. The Canadian Red Cross is one of the organizations that provide home support through the Department of Social Development. Some of its clients have opted to reduce or postpone visits too, said Dan Bedell, a spokesperson for the agency in Atlantic Canada. In most cases, however, the service is continuing, he said, \"with enhanced safety protocols.\ " Those protocols include minimizing direct contact and using protective gear such as gloves, masks and aprons. The Coalition for Seniors and Nursing Home Residents' Rights is trying to reach out to as many isolated seniors as it can. Cecile Cassista of the Coalition for Seniors and Nursing Home Residents' Rights says volunteers are calling as many seniors as they can to see if they are well and help relieve feelings of social isolation. (Wayne Chase Photography) Volunteers are calling 100 people a day for social visits over the telephone, said Cecile Cassista, the executive director. \"We're trying to give them comfort,\ " Cassista said. \"You can tell that there's a sense of loneliness, especially if their family members are out of province.\"   \"So it's important that we keep in touch with them. And keep the dialogue going.\" Board members are also distributing tips on how to stay physically and mentally healthy through their network of phone and email contacts. Meals on Wheels groups are trying to maintain social links with vulnerable populations, as well. A Fredericton Meals on Wheels volunteer driver picks up meals for delivery. Drivers are practising social distancing with clients, but still knocking on doors to check on their welfare. (Submitted by Betty Daniels) Volunteers normally stay and chat for a few minutes with clients when they drop off meals, said Betty Daniels, the executive director of Fredericton Meals on Wheels. It delivers about 240 meals a day to seniors, people with disabilities and people recovering from illness. \"In these circumstances, we're leaving the meals at the door and not interacting as much,\ " Daniels said. \"But most of our drivers are rapping at the door and checking to make sure everything is OK.\ " Every day she gets calls from drivers saying they didn't see certain clients around, so someone will make a followup phone call to check on them. \"We're at this point feeling that our clients are doing as well as can be expected in this situation.\ " The Emergency Measures Organization in northern New Brunswick has embarked on another campaign to do \"wellness checks\" from a distance.   It started in the village of Balmoral, said Ken Magee, EMO's area manager for northern New Brunswick. Residents who were at home self-isolating arranged through social media to flash their lights at 9:30 p.m., as a show of solidarity and to signal they were okay. Magee offered to show up in an EMO vehicle with flashing green lights. A fire truck went as well.   It was such a hit, said Magee, that it grew the next night to a parade of emergency vehicles through many city streets in Campbellton.   People in homes, vehicles and seniors' apartment buildings flashed their lights and waved as the parade passed. \"It was a real feel-good moment,\" said Magee. \"Glad to see they were social distancing … but at least their neighbours knew that they were safe and they were all getting through this together.\"
  The Canadian government says it's ordering millions of masks and thousands of ventilators to cope with the country's rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced today that his government has inked deals with three Canadian companies — Thornhill Medical, Medicom and Spartan Bioscience — to make critical medical supplies, including ventilators, surgical masks, test kits and other items, over the coming weeks   \"We know that the demand for critical equipment and supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stable supply of these products,\ " Trudeau said this morning. \"And that means making them at home and we're optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.\ " Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said the government ordered 60 million N95 masks — a type of mask designed and fitted to filter out particles that carry the COVID-19 virus — which will begin arriving this week. The federal government also has ordered close to 1,570 ventilators and more than a million COVID-19 test kits. WATCH: 'Made-in-Canada solutions,' Trudeau Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the government is focusing on made-in-Canada procurement to obtain ventilators, surgical masks, test kits and other medical supplies to cope with Canada's increasing COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks. 1:18 Anand said the government also is trying to secure an additional 4,000 ventilators — a crucial piece of equipment in a battle against a disease that attacks the lungs and can make it difficult for people to breathe on their own. \"This is all hands on deck,\" she said Tuesday. \"Our government is leaving no stone unturned.\" As part of the deal, Toronto-based Thornhill Medical is making 500 mobile compact ventilator systems and expects to have them out the door in early April. \"We are honoured to provide our Canadian-made ventilator system to support Canadians and our health care system in its efforts to fight COVID-19,\" said Thornhill Medical CEO Lesley Gouldie. More supplies coming Trudeau said Ottawa also has signed letters of intent with five other companies — Precision Biomonitoring, Fluid Energy Group, Irving Oil, Calko Group and Stanfield's — for critical supplies like hand sanitizer, tests and gowns. \"The entire world is trying to get its hands on the various equipment needed to fight this virus. That is why we know that it will be important to have made-in-Canada solutions,\ " he told reporters. As part of today's announcement, Trudeau said the government is allocating $2 billion to buy protective personal equipment in part through bulk purchases with the provinces and territories. WATCH:  Trudeau announces $2B for protective personal equipment Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has signed deals with three Canadian companies and allocated $2 billion to make medical supplies over the coming weeks to cope with the country's rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases. 2:14 On March 20, the federal government announced its intention to provide monetary support to manufacturers that can retool their assembly lines to make ventilators, masks and other personal protective gear, and to help those already making such products quickly scale up manufacturing capacity. Trudeau said close to 3,000 companies have reached out to offer their help since then. \"This is a priority for our government and we will continue to source new solutions every day,\" he said in his prepared remarks. WATCH:   Anand says delivery of personal protective equipment begins this week Public Services Minister Anita Anand spoke with reporters on Parliament Hill on Tuesday. 1:51 \"We are expecting shipments to come in in the coming days and we will continue to work tirelessly to get these supplies to where they're needed.\ " Trudeau said more supplies likely will be needed —  but how much will be up to Canadians themselves. \"We will need more masks, ventilators and testing kits, but how many more we need depends entirely on you,\ " he said. \"If you stay home and follow public health recommendations, you can slow the spread.\" International Trade Minister Mary Ng also announced earlier this month that the government is temporarily eliminating tariffs and taxes on all goods imported by public health authorities.   (CBC News) \"I think this will be a certain sigh of relief coming to the thousands of health care workers that we have right here in Hamilton Centre,\" said Matthew Green, NDP MP for Hamilton Centre. He said Canada is starting to see more instances of front line workers being exposed to COVID-19 in emergency rooms and long-term care facilities. \"This is a significant step forward. We're talking about literally millions of products being harnessed and distributed throughout our health care system,\ " he said. \"This is very much like an emergency war measures moment in Canadian history, where everybody is going to have to pull together to ensure that we have all the resources we need to fight this.\" Kelly Block, the Conservative critic for procurement, said her party will continue to press the Liberal government for clear timelines on the delivery of equipment. \"Canada has an immediate need for medical equipment in order to fight COVID-19,\ " Block said. \"This has been made clear by doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals across the country. The Liberals need to ensure that these frontline health care heroes have what they need to help and treat Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Global supply of protective equipment​​​​​​ Trudeau's announcement comes a day before China rolls out a new export regime governing how the personal protective equipment it manufactures can be shipped abroad. According a Chinese Ministry of Commerce statement issued today, starting April 1 Chinese exporters have to make masks, ventilators, gowns, face shields and other pandemic equipment to the standards of the country where the goods are being shipped. Omar Allam, a consultant on international trade and a former Canadian diplomat, is awaiting more details about the new regulations but said he has concerns about bureaucracy slowing down the worldwide distribution of badly-needed protective gear.   \"The concern on one side is it's going to delay shipments. Manufacturers will need to meet very strict guidelines in order to export [personal protective equipment] products such as masks and face shields that are in high demand,\ " Allam told CBC. \"On the flip side, it is viewed as a positive signal by the international community that the Chinese government is taking it very seriously and cracking down on shady manufacturers and suppliers.\ " CBC ExplainsWhat is a ventilator and how does it work?Ottawa unveils plan to harness industry to ramp up production of COVID-19 medical gear The European Commission, dealing with a huge spike in its caseload, moved on March 15 to limit the export of personal protective equipment to countries outside the EU.   Under EU rules, the export of any personal protective gear to countries outside the EU has to be approved by member states \"to ensure that vital equipment is available to those who need it most, throughout the EU,\" says a European Commission statement. Special provisions were later added to allow the export of this equipment to countries with unique economic and customs relationships with the EU, such as Iceland, Norway and the Vatican. 
  A 28-year-old inmate at the Edmonton Remand Centre who argued that he and other prisoners are in serious danger of contracting COVID-19 has had his request for bail turned down. David Carter's earlier applications for bail had already been turned down by a provincial court judge and a Court of Queen's Bench justice. On Tuesday, Court of Queen's Bench Justice John Gill was asked to review those two earlier decisions.   For the case to be heard, the defence had to show there had been a change in circumstances. Carter's defence lawyer, Mark Jordan, argued the pandemic represents that change. Carter considers himself a \"sitting duck\" at the remand centre, Jordan argued. \"There's no disinfectant or sanitizers made available to him and the cells are not properly sanitized. He and other inmates aren't being screened or tested or swabbed regularly.\ " Gill agreed that circumstances have changed.    Inmate population vulnerable during COVID-19 pandemic, lawyers say More than 2,000 inmates released, 6 COVID-19 cases confirmed inside Ontario jails  \"In terms of the COVID-19 situation, we obviously have a change in circumstances,\ " Gill said. \"We have Mr. Jordan putting forward evidence from his client. I don't think that establishes, in my opinion, a material risk to his health.\" Gill dismissed the bail application.  A publication ban covers the reasons for that decision.    Carter has been in custody since Dec. 28, 2019, after he was charged with breach of probation and a weapons offence.   In a three-page letter posted on his sister's Facebook page, Carter complained about what he called \"a social distancing lockdown\" that confines him to a cell with another inmate for 22½ hours a day.   \"To date this is the only measure being taken to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\ " he wrote. \"We are not being provided with gloves and/or masks and are being discouraged from making our own. We even face disciplinary segregation if we do so.\"  From March 15 and April 20, 151 inmates at the Edmonton Remand Centre were swabbed for COVID-19, according to provincial statistics. To date, there have been no positive cases at the facility, which is the largest of its kind in Canada with 1,952 beds.

(David Carter/Facebook ) It's not known how many prisoners are currently in the facility.   Carter said he is concerned his asthma would put him more at risk if he contracted the virus.   \"If I or someone else with breathing problems were to come in contact with the deadly virus in this centre, it will prove fatal,\ " he wrote. \"This letter is not a threat nor a get out of jail free card. This is merely a warning of things to come.\"  Carter is scheduled to go to trial in September. 
  In Sicily, Leonardo Sciascia will always be known for his writing, but in Hamilton, he's known lately for being constantly covered in cozy scarves. Despite his death in 1989, the Italian author and politician continues to live on through his life-sized bronze statue erected in front of Liuna Station on James Street North — and so do questions about why someone or some people continue to dress him in scarves. Donna Reid, who says she's lived in the area for more than two decades, says it's a move from staff at the station, which is now a reception hall. \"I think it's out of respect for the man it represents,\ " she tells CBC News. Leonardo Sciascia was a writer and politician from Sicily who died in 1989. (Colin Côté-Paulette/CBC) David Rutherford, an event planner with Liuna Station, thinks the scarves are linked to \"generous citizens.\" \"They tend to crochet scarves and mitts and put it on the statue for the homeless because there's a shelter down the street,\ " he says. \"If the homeless are cold, they can come down and grab a scarf, and [the group] has done this at Gore Park as well ... it's very endearing.\ " David Rutherford, an employee at Linua Station says the people putting scarves on the Leonardo Sciascia statue leave them out for the city's homeless population. (Bobby Hristova/CBC) But Miranda Bogdanowski, a receptionist at the station, says Sciascia's statue has been adorning scarves for the last two years and all come from the same person. \"There's this lady in the neighbourhood who knits scarves, brings them and puts them on there,\ " she tells CBC News. \"She introduced herself just recently to us.\ " Residents say the Leonardo Sciascia statue normally only has scarves all over it in the winter. (Colin Côté-Paulette/CBC) The mystery knitter is said to bring scarves a few times a week for the homeless — though who takes the scarves is also a mystery. \"We don't know for sure if homeless people take them, it's hard to tell,\ " Bogdanowski says. Recently, someone put a face mask on the statue, seemingly making light of the coronavirus. \"You have to find light in the dark times,\ " Rutherford says. \"Somebody has humour.\" The Leonardo Sciascia statue had a face mask placed on it Thursday, seemingly making jest of the spread of COVID-19. (Colin Côté-Paulette/CBC) Kamellia Mishriky, a local youth coach, who regularly walks by the statue thinks the face mask \"takes it too far.\ " But as for the scarves, she isn't too concerned about who makes them. \"It just puts a smile on my face.\" The statue of Leonardo Sciascia was created in Italy in 2017 and erected in Hamilton in the same year. It commemorated the 30th anniversary of the twinning of Hamilton and Sicilian town, Racalmuto. (Colin Côté-Paulette/CBC) 
  For 25 years, Victoria Salvan worked long, grueling hours as a patient attendant in a Montreal long-term care home. Sometimes she did so much overtime, she simply slept at work. But Salvan always treated patients with \"love and kindness,\" colleagues said. And that didn't change when the facility where she worked, like so many care homes in Quebec, experienced an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. On Friday, Salvan became the first patient attendant in the province to die of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Salvan spent her career at the Grace Dart Extended Care Centre, in the east end Montreal borough of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, where nearly a quarter of the residents have been infected with COVID-19, according to public health records.   Yet even the outbreak at Grace Dart didn't deter Salvan from caring for her patients, said her son, who asked not to be named. \"Our mother was always devoted to her work. She was selfless like that,\" he said in an interview with CBC News. 62 out of the 226 residents living at the Grace Dart Extended Care Centre have tested positive for COVID-19. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada) Her last shift was on April 10. She was told to go home early that day because she had a fever. On April 14, she was tested for COVID-19. The results came back positive the next day. According to her son, health officials told Salvan to stay home and said her symptoms — a fever and cough — would last about two weeks. She died at home two days later. She was 64, just weeks away from retiring, according to one colleague.    'She loved her patients' Salvan, or Vicky to her colleagues, was someone \"who got along with everybody\" and \"who loved her patients.\ " Every one got her full attention, said Theresa Moye, who worked alongside Salvan for close to 20 years before leaving Grace Dart in 2016.   She brought a smile to the residents of the long-term care home, Moye said, \"because they knew they would be treated with love and kindness.\ " Salvan often worked overtime to be able to give her children a good education. \"She worked crazy hard for those kids  —  that was her focus,\ " Moye said.   Salvan leaves behind a husband and two sons: one has graduated from university, the other is a Concordia student. Theresa Moye remembers Salvan's generosity and the ways she found to bond with residents. 1:42 Another colleague said Salvan was like \"the mother\" at Grace Dart, always giving out advice to younger staff members and bringing home-cooked meals to share with her coworkers. Valérie Verret said she was \"devastated\ " when she got the news of Salvan's death. But Verret also said it was \"inevitable\" that someone was going to die,  given the working conditions at the centre. \"She must have been tired, burnt out from double-shift after double-shift,\" said Verret. Orderlies worked without PPE, COVID-19 patients wandered Herron's halls for days after health agency took over Grace Dart is \"a mess,\" Verret said. She believes the death could have been prevented, if measures had been taken earlier to increase staffing. \"We are royally lacking in personnel. It's not liveable anymore.\ " Death was preventable, colleague says Long-term care homes in Quebec have suffered staffing shortages for years, caused in part by the low pay and difficult working conditions. Salvan's union representative said the ongoing problem has taken on a whole new meaning in the pandemic. Alexandre Prégent, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, estimated that 130 patient attendants in his local section alone are staying home because isolation measures. That puts even more pressure on people like Salvan to keep up the pace. Valérie Verret said her colleague Victoria Salvan was close to retiring and worked double-shifts regularly to be able to put her two sons through university.   (Radio-Canada) \"She worked her heart out,\" said Prégent. Salvan's son said his mother had mentioned to him that people were not showing up for work, and that Grace Dart was understaffed. Premier François Legault has indicated the government's central priority at the moment is addressing the staffing shortage at long-term care homes, also known by their French acronym as CHSLDs. Personel from hospitals around the province are being redeployed to CHSLDs. A spokesperson for the CIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-île-de-Montréal, the regional health authority that manages Grace Dart, said all of the facility's employees will be tested for COVID-19 on Monday. In an e-mail, the health authority stated that employees have all the protective equipment needed, including gloves, masks and face shields. Quebec doctor dies from COVID-19 Workers who have symptoms are also being isolated. The CIUSSS did not comment on whether extra staff will be coming in to relieve personnel. \"Vicky gave her life to Grace Dart, and she died because of it,\ " Verret, her colleague at the care home. \"She is the first in Quebec, but I don't think she will be the last.\"

This graphic shows the number of COVID-19 tests conducted, per one million people, by several countries and Canadian provinces as of Mar. 23. (CBC News) House of Commons suspended amid COVID-19 aid package negotiations Shortly after House of Commons proceedings began today, the chamber suspended itself while the Liberal government and opposition parties negotiate the finer points of a bill to deliver aid to Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Opposition Conservatives have said they are not willing to vote for the bill as it is written. The Liberal government has already backed away from one controversial proposal in the bill — part 2, which would have given the government sweeping new powers to spend, borrow and tax Canadians for 21 months without parliamentary approval. The negotiations between the parties are still going on and the Commons will be suspended until there is a deal reached to define the powers Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet can use to spend public money during this crisis. Read more     Most premiers don't think Emergencies Act is needed yet, Trudeau says Every province and territory has declared either a state of emergency or a public health emergency, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said most premiers do not think it's necessary \"at this time\" to invoke the federal Emergencies Act. Trudeau said invoking the act would give the federal government special powers to co-ordinate and rearrange logistical supply chains — but most premiers on the call late Monday told the PM they don't think that's needed right now. \"I impressed on them the need to further co-ordinate and provide data on things like how many ventilators they have, so that we can make sure that they are going to the areas — maybe not in their province, but next door — that need them the most and ensure a better level of flow of emergency equipment to the places that need it,\ " Trudeau said today. Read more Tokyo Olympics officially postponed to 2021 — now what? Athletes still have unanswered questions despite confirmation from the International Olympic Committee that the 2020 Tokyo Games will be postponed because of the ongoing pandemic. \"The big uncertainty is what does qualification look like?\" said Canadian wrestler Erica Wiebe, who won gold at the Rio Olympics in 2016. \"What is the actual postponement start date? Will international federations set up competitions between now and a 2021 Games to mitigate lost competition opportunities leading into a 2021 Games? There are also two major international events set for the summer of 2021 that will undoubtedly be impacted by the postponement: the world athletics and world aquatics championships. World Athletics, track and field's governing body, said it's talking with organizers about alternative dates for the track world championships set for Eugene, Ore. Read more ANALYSIS Why police are reluctant to ticket, arrest COVID-19 rule-breakers So far, the threats of stiff fines and even criminal charges for those flouting COVID-19 measures appear to be mostly tough talk, as authorities opt for persuasion over punishment. \"We're not as concerned with enforcement so much as the priority being getting that message across, because compliance is really our goal here,\" said Les Parker, a spokesperson for the Regina Police Service. A survey of select police forces across Canada finds little evidence that officers are busting up large gatherings or ticketing business owners who defy government calls to shutter non-essential services while the outbreak runs its course. \"We're being given that tool. However, it's the type of tool that we never wish to use, that we don't intend to use,\" said Insp. André Durocher of Montreal's police service. \"The instructions that have been given to our police officers is this is a tool to be used as an extreme last resort.\" There is also the question of whether any of these extraordinary anti-COVID measures would actually stand up in court. Martha Jackman, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said the fines and restrictions may well end up being challenged on constitutional grounds. THE SCIENCE Should healthy people wear masks while in public? No, according to Dr. Mark Loeb, because there's a shortage of masks and healthy people don't need them. Loeb, a professor of pathology and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, said people should be social distancing so they're never in a position where they might be exposed to a cough or sneeze from someone with COVID-19. Meanwhile, health-care professionals, who certainly will be exposed, are running out. \"There's a very limited supply that's getting more limited,\" he said. Researchers and public health officials say improper use of face masks — such as not changing disposable masks or not handwashing — could potentially increase risk of disease transmission. AND FINALLY... Beating the coronavirus — literally Cathy MacDonald and her daughters in Quyon, Que. created a COVID-19 pinata as a birthday gift for a friend who is working at the office through the crisis. “ Although not an amusing situation we find ourselves in, the objective was to try and ‘kill’ the virus,” she writes. (Submitted by Cathy MacDonald) Cathy MacDonald and her daughters in Quyon, Que., created a COVID-19-shaped piñata as a birthday gift for a friend. Inside are wrapped candies and rolls of toilet paper. \"Although not an amusing situation we find ourselves in, the objective was to try and 'kill' the virus,\ " MacDonald said.

  This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.   As COVID-19 continues its deadly spread across the country, health-care workers on the front lines of the pandemic are having to adapt their behaviour in a variety of ways, both in hospital and at home. The highly contagious virus that surrounds them on a daily basis informs nearly every decision and every action. The overriding goal is to help patients who are suffering, while also protecting themselves and others, including their loved ones, from catching COVID-19.    Whether it's how they interact with critically ill patients, including how often; how they eat their meals while on duty; and what they do before they even walk in the door at home after a shift — nearly every routine has changed.   At the system level, Canada is adapting to the crisis by expanding hospital capacity, training staff for new roles and inviting retired health-care workers to return to duty. Down at individual level, Patty Tamlin of Stouffville, Ont. , knows what's at stake. She works as an intensive care nurse in the Scarborough Health Network's Birchmount site in Toronto's east end.  Tamlin, 59, was infected with SARS on the job in 2003. Toronto intensive care nurse Patty Tamlin, left, says if she doesn't have the protective equipment she needs to enter a COVID-19 room, her family's safety will come first. (Submitted by Patty Tamlin) She won't shy away from caring for patients so long as she's adequately protected with the proper gear, she said. The supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been a persistent concern of hers as the outbreak continues. She's not only concerned about her own safety, but that of her husband, who is recovering from cancer. \"For me, with having somebody who's immunocompromised at home from chemotherapy, I'm obsessive,\ " Tamlin said of the precautions she takes to avoid infection. INTERACTIVEAre Canada's efforts to flatten the curve working?    Tamlin's not alone in constantly taking extra care. Hospital workers are meticulous about physical distancing at work, including at lunch. Everyone working in the hospital wears surgical masks. They're given two per day. At lunch, staff remove their mask to eat, either in the regular staff room, in a conference room or in the lobby to keep away from each other.    \"I missed my dinner break [Wednesday] and that will happen more,\ " Tamlin said. \"I am more dehydrated, as I can't step away to get a drink of water as easily.\" Tamlin said everyone tries to stay cheerful and support each other.    When she arrives home after a shift, she leaves her shoes outside, takes off her clothes immediately once inside to put them directly in the wash, and then hits the shower. \"I wash my hair, everything. I even wash my hair tie, even though … my head is covered all day.\" A nurse's armour Tamlin said a big concern is what could happen if a surge in cases on the scale of what happened in Italy or New York City were to occur in Toronto and the supply of N95 masks to treat the sickest patients needed to be rationed.   \"A cop has a vest and a gun,\ " Tamlin said. \"I should have a gown and a mask if I'm going to provide care.\" Tamlin prepares to work with COVID-19 patients in Toronto. (Byron Piedad) When critically ill patients are in distress, they may need to be intubated by having a tube inserted through the mouth and into the airway. During intubation, virus-laden droplets that are smaller than what we expel in a regular cough spread everywhere. That's why health-care workers need to wear N95 masks, face shields and gowns that liquid can't penetrate, as well as plastic aprons on top of their gowns and other PPE. If the supply of aprons were to run out briefly, as it did in one New York City hospital, Tamlin plans to resort to using garbage bags. Care teams shrink Before the pandemic, a team of several doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists would rush into the room if a patient needed to be resuscitated. That was before masks, face shields, gowns, gloves and other gear needed to be preserved.   \"Let's just have the two of us in there,\ " Tamlin said of how critical care teams work now. The PPE needs to be put on and carefully removed between patients, along with handwashing and absolutely no touching one's face. Even a momentary lapse risks exposing a health-care worker to the virus.   Normally, Tamlin would go into a patient's room whenever called. Now, she tells patients that's no longer possible. Instead, she plans to accomplish several tasks in a single visit, such as providing medication, getting blood work, and repositioning a patient in their bed. Tamlin said staff are also trying to use long extension tubes to roll IV pumps out of the room as well, so someone doesn't need to go in to make adjustments. Dr. Bruce Lampard says the tension he feels in his body now resembles what he felt during the height of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.   (Bruno De Cock/MSF) When Tamlin looks at hard-hit New York, she admires how front-line workers from elsewhere in the U.S. are leaving their homes and families to help out.   \"What I see is our future — our relatively immediate future,\" said said, both in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada. On Thursday, health officials in Ontario announced the death of a hospital worker, a grim first for the province. The sheer number of people infected worldwide in the pandemic is a major difference from SARS, Tamlin said. SARS resulted in more than 8,000 cases in 2003, according to the World Health Organization. There are already more than 1.3 million COVID-19 cases globally.   ' Tension in your body' Like Tamlin, Dr. Bruce Lampard, an emergency room physician with Toronto's University Health Network, is constantly taking precautions to guard against the virus. He said he now washes his hands \"hundreds of times a day\" and wipes down everything, including his glasses and cellphone, which he keeps covered in a small plastic bag. He worked in an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone in November 2014 with Doctors Without Borders, and now sits on the group's international board of directors. \"Going to that project in Sierra Leone, there was just that feeling of a little bit of tension in your body and doing your best to try and use it to keep yourself sharp,\" he said. \"I feel the same thing now.\"   Lampard suspects much of the tension he feels comes from the many unknowns of the pandemic. He said lingering questions about the extent people pass on COVID-19 to others before showing symptoms — or in cases where they seemingly have no symptoms at all — provoke some anxiety. Still, he keeps a positive outlook and sleeps soundly, confident in his training, he said. In harm's way Dr. Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association, said he's hearing from physicians across the country about how the uncertainty surrounding supplies of PPE adds to the stress and anxiety they're feeling. Doctors, nurses demand government fill 'unacceptable' gaps in protective gear on front linesCBC Investigates'I was made to feel belittled': Nurses reveal fears working on front lines of COVID-19 pandemic Buchman said he wants to see more equipment and information about supply levels so health workers can prepare.   \"Ethically,\" he said, \"there's a reciprocity on the government's end, on society's end, to provide that personal protective equipment to those health-care workers on the front line to protect them when they put themselves in harm's way.\ " WATCH | What you need to know about wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic: ' The point of the mask,' says Christopher Labos, 'is to protect others from you,' especially if you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. 2:58 As a side gig, Tamlin also usually serves as a host at a community radio station. She recently recorded a public service announcement. The message? \"Stay the heck at home … so that I don't have to look after as many people.\"   To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe. 
  Licensed New Brunswick restaurants will be able to sell liquor with takeout and delivery orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Blaine Higgs announced on Thursday. It's one of the amendments to the state of emergency declaration, which has been extended by another two weeks, he told reporters during the daily update in Fredericton. It's meant to assist the province's restaurants as they struggle with the ban on dining-in, said Higgs. The restaurants will have to abide by all of the normal conditions of their liquor licence and \"take special care\" to ensure they do not deliver to minors, he said.   In the weeks ahead, we will look for other adjustments.- Blaine Higgs, premier Earlier this week, the World Health Organization/Europe recommended governments restrict access to alcohol during COVID-19 lockdowns. \"Alcohol consumption is associated with a range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and mental health disorders, which can make a person more vulnerable to COVID-19,\ " WHO said in a statement Tuesday. Premier Blaine Higgs announced Thursday the state of emergency in New Brunswick has been extended for two weeks. 1:54 Alcohol is also \"known to be harmful to health in general, and is well understood to increase the risk of injury and violence, including intimate partner violence, and can cause alcohol poisoning,\ " it said. \"Therefore, people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" WHO said it \"encourages governments to enforce measures which limit alcohol consumption.\" No new cases of COVID-19 were announced on Thursday. (CBC ) Asked how the province would respond to critics who would argue access to alcohol should be curbed during the state of emergency, not increased, chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell said the government \"weighed the pros and cons.\ " \"Alcohol is probably one of the few drugs that the withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. So there are reasons that we took into account around that and mental health and addictions.\" NB Liquor and Cannabis NB stores have remained open during the state of emergency. The premier has previously said the government did not want to allow the black market to explode. Higgs said Thursday that other provinces have already allowed their restaurants to sell alcohol with food orders. The government made the change at the request of the New Brunswick Restaurant Association, he said. In addition, under the amendments, the government said restaurants offering takeout must ensure customers who are waiting on-site for their food must respect the physical-distancing requirement of at least six feet, or two metres. Dr. Jennifer Russell provided an update to reporters in Fredericton on Thursday. (Submitted by Government of New Brunswick.) Gardening and agricultural retailers will also be allowed to reopen effective immediately, the premier said, describing them as an important part of the food supply. But they must ensure their employees and customers respect the physical distancing requirement. The state of emergency declaration will continue to be extended until the government is confident the restrictions are no longer needed to slow the spread of the virus, said Higgs. \"In the weeks ahead, we will look for other adjustments\" to support the province's businesses, he said. He said the government is keen to help them recover and for New Brunswickers to begin to return to some of their normal activities. Here is a roundup of other developments. No new cases, but public told not to relax yet There are no new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick and the total number of cases stands at 117, the chief medical officer of health announced Thursday. \"This is good news, but we must not lose focus,\" said Dr. Jennifer Russell. The actions being taken are slowing the spread and building barriers the virus cannot cross, but everyone needs to continue to stay home as much as possible, she stressed. One case can quickly spread to three other people through close contacts, Russell said. Within a matter of weeks, that can quickly multiply to 2,187 cases. The declaration will continue to be extended in two-week increments until the government is confident it is no longer needed, he said.   Of the 117 cases, 66 are travel-related, 42 are close contacts of previously confirmed cases, and nine are the result of community transmission. There are no cases under investigation. During the pandemic, 12 people have been hospitalized and seven have since been discharged. Six patients remain in hospital, including three in intensive care. To date, 80 people have recovered. Premier to speak with other first ministers Premier Blaine Higgs planned to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland and other premiers electronically on Thursday night. He told reporters he intends to raise his concerns regarding New Brunswick's fishing industry. Premier Blaine Higgs said Thursday restaurants in New Brunswick that have liquor licences can now deliver alcohol and arrange pickup. 1:15 \"Our processing plants aren't able to start up at this time,\ " he said.    Higgs also planned to discuss the oversupply of food, including potatoes, in the agricultural sector because of the outbreak; financial aid, including rent support, for businesses during the shutdown, and which kinds of businesses should be able to reopen early, and which will have to wait. \"Generally, every province has a chance to talk about their particular concerns,\ " he said of the meeting. Province asks pharmacists not to charge prescription co-pay   Last month, pharmacists imposed a 30-day limit on prescription refills pharmacists to protect the drug supply. This has led to more frequent fees than usual in some case   But Premier Blaine Higgs is asking all pharmacists to relieve clients of extra dispensary and co-pay fees.   \"Since the pandemic began, I know there has been an issue for some people around paying multiple dispensing fees or co-pays for prescriptions,\ " he said. \"This is because many people who typically receive a refill of their prescriptions to last 60 or 90 days are no receiving refills to last 30 days.\ "   He said officials are working with pharmacists to address the issue. It's also possible the supply of certain drugs is not as uncertain as it is for some others and can be treated differently. Province doesn't have fiscal capacity to help all municipalities   Premier Blaine Higgs doesn't believe the province can afford to help all municipalities equally during the COVID-19 outbreak. But he will be discussing the issue with the Association of Municipal Administrators of New Brunswick on Friday.   He said the province will work with the municipalities on a case-by-case basis. He'll also look at their ability to borrow money or run a deficit. \"We won't have the fiscal capacity to just let everyone do the same thing and try to bring them back to where they were,\ " Higgs said.    A lot of municipalities have struggled during the coronavirus outbreak. Moncton and Saint John, for instance, expect the financial hit to be in the millions of dollars. Canadian municapalities are not allowed to budget for deficits. Restrictions could be eased if border stayed shut, ex-official says A slow reopening of New Brunswick, while keeping the borders closed, could be a safe step forward, New Brunswick's former chief medical officer of health says.   It's been almost one month since Premier Blaine Higgs declared a state of emergency, giving the government broad powers to enforce business closures and social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \"It's important that we start freeing up people as best we can and moving on the economy as quickly as we can, while recognizing that we still have a serious disease to deal with and mitigate,\ "  Dr. Eilish Cleary said Thursday.   When is someone considered 'recovered' from COVID-19?   The province confirmed one new case of COVID-19 on Wednesday. No new cases were reported Tuesday and only two new cases were reported on Monday. Although further testing is required to confirm there are few to no cases of community transmission, Cleary said it's time to move with caution to the next phase.   She said that phase would include allowing businesses to start reopening, with caution, and letting friends visit each other. Gatherings should still be banned, Cleary said. Dr. Eilish Cleary, New Brunswick's former chief medical officer of health, said  businesses could soon slowly start to reopen and friends could soon visit each other. ((CBC)) All of the restrictions have bought the province time, she said, and have created a safer space within New Brunswick.   \"We've closed up our borders, we've hunkered down to ride out the storm,\ " Cleary said.    All boat tours docked until at least July 1, one operator loses $70K in sales   \"And although we need more evidence to prove it, the signs are that we've been successful so far.\ " Cleary made it clear this coronavirus hasn't gone away and is likely to stay for a while yet. Quick detection of the virus is also still needed, even when restrictions are reduced.    Questions abound on how New Brunswick could safely reopen   \"We will continue to see more cases from now until the time we have a vaccine.\" Cleary compared New Brunswick to a hedgehog crumpling into a prickly ball to protect itself.   \"Just like the hedgehog eventually needs to come out and get some food and water or it will die, what we're doing at the moment is not sustainable.\"   She said the province should also identify and move to protect vulnerable populations, such as residents of long-term care homes and prisons, by conducting more tests. \"We have to pay particular attention to protect the residents and the staff there,\ " Cleary said.   Contaminated test kits delivered from China Thousands of kits meant to screen for COVID-19 delivered to New Brunswick from a supplier in China last week were contaminated and unusable. Dr. Richard Garceau, a microbiologist-infectologist at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton, told Radio-Canada more than 6,400 test kits were contaminated. This Moncton teacher creates small 3d-printed objects that hold surgical masks in place without having the elastic straps rubbing behind your ears for long stretches. 2:07 \"As soon as we received them, we realized that they were all contaminated with bacteria  … In addition to being contaminated, the product was defective,\ " Garceau said.   The kits included swabs and sterilized tubes.    Thousands of contaminated test kits delivered to New Brunswick   When asked by a reporter Wednesday about how many test kits the province has, Premier Blaine Higgs said \"there are plenty of test kits\" to meet the demand for testing. \"Supplies are not restricting our ability to provide maximum health care and testing that we need to do, as it's decided to be done,\ " Higgs said.   On Thursday, Higgs said he was made aware of the defective kits a week ago, and was disappointed by the news.   Dental offices remain closed but still able to help Dental offices across the province are still closed, but dentists are on call to treat patients in emergencies. Paul Blanchard, executive director of the New Brunswick Dental Society, said people shouldn't shy away from contacting their dentist if they're experiencing pain. There are four categories of emergencies: oral facial trauma, significant infection, prolonged bleeding that doesn't stop after 15 minutes, and major pain that can't be managed with over-the-counter drugs.   Moncton builders consider delaying projects as pandemic continues   Resources are being centralized, so only some dentists in major areas, such as Fredericton, Saint John, Moncton and Edmundston, are available to treat emergency situations. Regular teeth cleanings are not considered an emergency and should be rescheduled once dentist offices are open again. There's a lot of confusion about face masks now.

  Medical students in Newfoundland and Labrador have launched a drive to collect personal protective equipment for the fight against COVID-19. They're gathering masks, gowns and gloves for front-line health-care workers risking exposure to the potentially deadly virus. \"They need this equipment to stay healthy and do their work helping people who have become infected with the virus,\" said Aanchal Ralhan​​​​​​, one of the group's organizers.
